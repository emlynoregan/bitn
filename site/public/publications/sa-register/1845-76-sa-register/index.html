<p>Charles Beck Hon. Jacob Hagen John Cundy Sleman</p>
<p>Emanuel Solomon Henry Mildred Alderman William Peacock</p>
<p>William Paxton Samuel Stocks Jnr Matthew Smith</p>

<p>30 April 1845, page 3</p>
<p>SA Mining Association Meeting</p>
<p>The Association met at the Auction mart Tavern with Samuel Stocks in the chair. Members heard a report on the copper discover on section 5561 and discussed the advisability of buying land immediately or deferring purchase. Henry Ayres [sic] was elected Secretary. The election of directors resulted in the following gaining office:</p>
<p>Emanuel Solomon 96 votes</p>
<p>John Cundy Sleman 90</p>
<p>Charles Beck 86</p>
<p>Samuel Stocks Jnr 83</p>
<p>Alderman Peacock 72</p>
<p>Hon. Jacob Hagen 61</p>
<p>George Bean 55</p>
<p>Unsuccessful were: Henry Mildred, William Paxton, Matthew Smith, Thomas Whistler, Samuel Payne, Tom Cox Bray, Robert Sanders and Edward Castres Gwynne.</p>
<p>[Others mentioned as attending were: Mr Bunce, Mr Collyer, Andrew Murray, Mr J.B. Neales and Mr Pepperell.</p>

<p>The New Copper Mines</p>
<p>Adelaide was in some excitement when it was discovered that Messrs Phillipson &amp; Nixon and Mr Jacob Hagen had taken out contiguous sections in the Onkaparinga District, with each believing their section embraces to spot on which copper lodes have been opened. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Mineral Lands. We understand several members of the South Australian Mining Association have recently applied for mineral lands around the Kapunda Copper Mine, to the extent of £6,000 to £7,000. They are yet to be surveyed.</p>

<p>Land Sales. [The article regrets that the former practice of announcing in the Government Gazette the particulars of all selections and purchases of land from week to week was no longer being followed. The paper wished not only for this practice to be resumed, but for a balance sheet of costs and income from land sales as well. (Since profits from land sales could be used for local improvements.) The writer hoped for more debate about expenditure and suggested a suitable project.]</p>

<p>Discovery of Cooper Ore in the North</p>
<p>Mineral riches showing on the surface for an extent of several miles are reported and have excited the minds of sober-minded citizens. The location of this discovery is said to be north of Adelaide between the South land of the Murray and Mt Bryant [sic: for Mt Bryan.] This mass of mineral will doubtless attract the attention and capital of our countrymen and increase our population and also the value of this settlement. An increase in exports would ensure more frequent shipping arrivals, as no ship would have to fear delays in obtaining a cargo. Such an increase in population and inflow of capital is greatly to be desired. The mine workers would need feeding, clothing and lodgings, to say nothing of luxuries.</p>
<p>25 June 1845, page 3</p>
<p>Projected Special Survey. Yesterday those interested in the proposed Special Survey proceeded in a body to view Mr Finke’s recent discoveries in the North, the announcement of which seems to have paralysed all other mining operations. If the area proves as valuable as expected and the mines be developed, they must benefit the colony at large, let them belong to whom they may.</p>
<p>28 June 1845, page 2</p>
<p>The New Copper Discoveries</p>
<p>Provided the new discoveries are taken up in a bona fide and not a speculative spirit, they must, if proved to be as rich as they seem, be beneficial to every individual interest in the colony. If the gentlemen who are going about taking out the large special survey are animated by a spirit to truly develop the mine, the operations will benefit the agriculturalists, flockmasters, merchants, tradesmen, mechanics and others in the colony. To work even a twentieth of the proposed survey would require several hundred miners with wives and families, plus all those required for transport and in the subsidiary employments to which the operations would give rise.</p>
<p>[The article then goes an at length to explore the ways in which the wealth of the whole colony would be increased by a successful mining operation and how it would attract European and British capital to other ventures in the colony.]</p>
<p>2 July 1845, page 2</p>
<p>‘A Family Man’ of Adelaide writes dated 19 June.</p>
<p>[The writer is fearful of the effect the investment of such a large sum as £20,000 in mineral land would have on the colony. In the early days of the colony, he says, the colony suffered from the spirit of speculation and this discovery seems to have reignited that flame. The British public already look upon the SA experiment in colonisation as a complete failure and both the capitalists and the Government have strong reasons to doubt the soundness of the theory of colonisation. He goes on to write that in the past three years things have changed in SA. There has been a close application of legitimate business, resulting in increasing production of necessities, the abundant increase in flocks and herds and workers are now profitably employed and exports exceed imports.</p>
<p>‘The moral and religious character of our producing population stand [sic] pre-eminent amongst the Colonies of the British Crown.’</p>
<p>And a better tone pervades the elite of the Province.</p>
<p>The writer then expresses his fear of the consequences of withdrawing such a large amount of capital from other uses, where it would double its value in seven years. The mining venture is a project that is unlikely, he believes, to produce a yield within that time frame and from which it could not be withdrawn without great loss. This dangerous leap into the unknown will, he says, only confirm to others that the colony has not abandoned speculation. Such an investment must only be carried out through the use of surplus capital and not by diverting capital indispensable to ordinary pursuits.</p>
<p>He calls on the Governor to intervene so as to prevent ‘that which I am apprehensive will proves a public calamity’.]</p>
<p>9 July 1845, page 3</p>
<p>SA Mining Assoc. met and although no business was transacted, it was stated that the bank balance was £1,631-10-6.</p>
<p>6 August 1845, page 2</p>
<p>‘LSD’ writes on ‘The Monster Mine of Twenty Thousand Acres.’</p>
<p>[He says there will be many opinions among investors about what to do with the mine and he lists such ideas as:</p>
<p>Work the mine extensively for maximum profit.</p>
<p>Work it on a modest scale.</p>
<p>Don’t work it at all.</p>
<p>Re-sell it immediately at a profit.</p>
<p>Re-sell it later at a larger profit.</p>
<p>His suggestion is to divide the area into 10 or 20 portions and dispose of half of them to speculators, recovering in the process the initial outlay of the original purchasers.</p>
<p>He then elaborates on how this proposal would work.]</p>
<p>13 August 1845, page 2</p>
<p>The Monster Mine is not taken up after all and still remains available to the first applicant who has the money at command. However, the impression of its great value is unabated.</p>
<p>The men of Hindley St confessed to being fairly beaten last Saturday and they have since come into collision with the Bank of SA. The South Australian Company is also stymied and is apparently waiting on the arrival of the Dorset. Without a coalition of forces the Special Survey must remain in abeyance, unless the associated merchants and traders find means to grasp the whole.</p>
<p>All parties are spurred on by the intimation that the Governor is in daily expectation of despatches from the Home Government ordering him to suspend the sale on mineral lands of the Province.</p>
<p>We think that gigantic operations of this kind ought to be financed from either specially imported capital or surplus capital of the colony.</p>
<p>20 August 1845, page 2</p>
<p>The Special Survey of Mineral Land Taken at Last</p>
<p>Having rejected the offer of Messrs Bagot and Aston of 12,000 sovereigns and the acceptance of the Bank of SA, the Governor later offered to sell the Special Survey land to the highest bidder on what may be regarded as a long credit with a deposit of 10%.</p>
<p>The Governor’s new offer was for the survey of a block of 20,000 or more acres, which must be in a compact block with one side no more than twice the length of any other side. The block must be pointed out to the Surveyor General or to the officer appointed by him for that purpose within ten days from the date for acceptance of the tender: Wednesday 20 August 1845. A deposit of 10% of the price offered must be paid into the Treasury at the time of the opening of tenders and the notification of the acceptance of either of the tenders. The residue of the money to be paid within three months from that date and on failure of such payment the deposit shall be forfeited and the contract be null and void. The Government will not object to two grants for the portions of the survey instead of one grant for the entire block, provided a request to this effect is inserted in the tender. A fee of 10 guineas will be charged upon delivery of each grant.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make roads, railroads, canals or bridges and to take clay, stone gravel and indigenous timber for the construction and repair of roads, bridges, fences, embankments, dams, sewers, drains and other public works.</p>
<p>Under 15 Sect. of c. 36 5th &amp; 6th Vict. being the Act for regulation of the sale of waste lands belonging to the Crown in the Australian Colonies the amount tendered cannot be less than one pound per acre.</p>
<p>Identical letters were sent to the Manager of the SA Company and to Messrs S. Stocks Esq. and other competing gentlemen.</p>
<p>[The paper considered that this amounted to the Governor availing himself of the two parties’ infatuation with mining, to draw from them the largest possible sum he could get and of relaxing his demands only to increase the chances of their indiscretion leading them to make an offer. There was the possibility of speculative competition forcing up the price.]</p>
<p>Fortunately the South Australian Company decided not to become a competitor in this tender system and this left the field for a coalition of the remaining two parties who then united for the purpose of securing the survey by purchase without tender at the upset price of twenty shillings (£1) per acre.</p>
<p>A.M. Mundy as Colonial Secretary accepted their offer.</p>
<p>[The paper considered the Governor had blundered by not adhering strictly to the demand for all the purchase money to be paid down. In stead he had acted ‘not in the spirit of the Waste Lands act, but by affording the utmost facilities to mere adventurers to gamble with the rich lands of the colony’. The article develops these views at some length.]</p>
<p>We shall be met perhaps with the assertion that the letters from the Colonial Secretary dated 15 August have been recalled and the business having been arranged on other terms, the matter ends here. We say the letters still exist and are public knowledge and until they are officially withdrawn or disavowed or repudiated any party has a right to go to Treasury and claim a Special Survey of 20,000 or more acres, tender his 10% and take his Excellency’s three months’ grace to pay the balance, subject to the forfeiture of the deposit in the event of failure. If he were met with a refusal, he would be justified in charging the Government with a want of good faith. Mischief may yet ensue from this want of firmness in the executive.</p>
<p>We hope the Government will indicate the positive course it will pursue on all future claims of a large Special Survey and will withdraw the quasi-gambling letters, which issued from the Colonial Secretary’s office on the 15 August.</p>
<p>[The paper then goes on to congratulate the Government on extricating itself from an awkward position and the successful parties for having obtained their objective. It urges caution however, as they have only done so by withdrawing their capital from other more legitimate pursuits. It warns that the Bank of SA continues to embargo discounts and accommodation, which may yet cause great inconvenience in the coming months and warns of the wages and transport costs that will have to be paid in advance of sales, with a bank that is unwilling to make the usual advances. In short it wishes them success, while urging caution.]</p>

<p>Monster Mining, Banking and ‘The Boiler Not Yet Burst’.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the writer begins, the croakers are up and at work.</p>
<p>[The author decries those who say that it will all end in disaster. Those who claim that as a result of this use of the colony’s funds no bank will lend money, no ship will bring more gold in and business in the colony will be greatly disturbed, if not destroyed, by this payment of £20,000 for a Special Survey. He goes on to assure readers that the mine certainly contains plenty of copper, which when got out will pay a large direct and indirect profit to all in the Province. He ends by assuring them that he ‘is sure the mania is over’.]</p>
<p>23 August 1845, page 2</p>
<p>More Copper than Tin</p>
<p>When the Burra Creek or Monster Mine first came to be generally known, the great size of its riches not surprisingly led to such an intense struggle to get control of it that people were willing to make sacrifices that may have been of questionable prudence. The excitement caused more accurate research and now we hear of another Special Survey in the same district that far exceeds it in extent and apparent richness. Discoveries are being made almost daily in almost every direction, to an extent that would appear incredible were they not described by parties with cool heads and no personal interest in the matter.</p>
<p>We may say that one object of His Excellency’s present excursion is to see a copper lode more than 12 miles long and of a greater breadth than the one on Burra Creek. It lies some 8 miles east of Balhannah. We might name a dozen other discoveries of great richness (omitting here the vast mineral deposits in the great district of Port Lincoln.)</p>
<p>23 August 1845, page 3</p>
<p>Letters of Fiat Justitia No. 9: To the Commercial Mining Speculators</p>
<p>[The writer says both individual people and commercial communities have fits of insanity and the crisis point in such fits is termed ‘a panic’. At such times there is an absence of thought, feeling and expression, except for the one prevalent illusion, which becomes all absorbing. He recalls in England panics in 1819, 1825 and 1837. He fears the present discovery of mines in South Australia will lead to extended embarrassment and ultimate ruin. The scramble to invest in ‘The Mining Association’ is an invitation to partake in a wild gambling scramble after sudden wealth. He fears the reaction in South Australia, the result of the inevitable losses and consequential ruin, will be more pronounced because capital is so limited and property subject to more extreme fluctuation.</p>
<p>Merchants and traders need to realise that their own businesses require all their capital, their energy, their industry and prudence. If there is surplus capital it should be invested in areas where the merchants’ own knowledge or experience is greatest.</p>
<p>That the sums required for the purchase of the Special Survey could have been wisely abstracted from the resources of the merchants involved is beyond belief.</p>
<p>This is the course of gamblers.</p>
<p>Fiat Justitia does not doubt the discoveries are important or that their value is great, but holds that they need more capital to make then profitable than this limited community can afford.]</p>

<p>The Monster Mine</p>
<p>Some of the party who went to inspect the boundary of the Monster Mine returned yesterday after experiencing some of the most tempestuous weather they have ever witnessed. Our correspondent says there is every probability that the hopes of speculators will be realised. Having traversed the whole of the line he is satisfied a more splendid country for mining operations does not exist. When he was there the Surveyor General was pitching his tents, but had not begun operations. There is no want of food and water for cattle and the Burra Creek, which extends three parts of the length of the mine, will in all probability have good running water all the year. There is some misunderstanding between the Government and the Gentlemen who have taken the Special Survey regarding the shape of the Survey. The Governor says the shape should be a rectangle, while the purchasers would favour a rhomboid form to embrace more of the visible mineral wealth.</p>

<p>Important to Our Mining Proprietors</p>
<p>A reprint of an article in the Maitland Mercury (NSW)</p>
<p>Since our last we have been informed that some owners of copper mines in SA have found the heavy costs in transmitting their ores to England for smelting makes a heavy inroad into their profits. They are anxious to see whether they can be smelted in the colonies and what facilities the port of Newcastle offers for the smelting trade.</p>
<p>England is about 15,000 miles away and Newcastle about 1,500. The cost to the latter should represent a saving of about two thirds, as there would be return cargoes of coal. (As happens in the case of ores transported from Cornwall to Wales.) At present most ships come to Newcastle in ballast, but a different deal would be struck for ships bringing ore one way and returning with coal. Other return items from Newcastle could be cloth, tobacco, leather, salt, soap, pottery etc. Slate could also come from South Australia to Newcastle, as at first full cargoes of ore might not be available. Newcastle Harbour is of easy access and admits the largest vessels. Smelters could be erected close to the wharves. Newcastle has unlimited supplies of cheap fuel. A market for copper could be found in India.</p>
<p>[The Register observes that the Maitland author seems unaware that the supplies of wood fuel in South Australia would meet the vast consumption for some generations to come, even if South Australia does not find its own coal reserves. The positive aspect of the article, it believes, lies in its desire to expand inter-colonial trade and develop Australian manufacturing capabilities.]</p>

<p>Burra Creek Ores</p>
<p>Portions of ores of the main northern lodes at Burra Creek have been tested by Messrs Elphick and Davey. The ores (nearly all red oxide) tested by Mr Elphick yielded 711⁄4%, 960 grains of ore leaving 685 grains of pure metal. Dr Davey’s sample of green copper, red copper and a yellowish substance produced 631⁄2% copper. Men have been sent up with four drays and a quantity is expected in Adelaide in the course of the next week.</p>
<p>[Bon Accord]</p>
<p>We have reason to believe another Special Survey will be taken shortly northwards from the north end of the Burra Creek Survey.</p>
<p>8 October 1845, page 2</p>
<p>Gawler Town. No place in the province has benefited more than Gawler Town from the opening of extraordinary copper mines to the north. It is now universally believed that it must become the second town in the province. It is not at present a large place, containing only twenty houses, but it shows vigorous growth as many of these houses have been recently built. A steam flour mill has recently been built and is soon to open. There is a butcher, tin plate workers, blacksmiths, carpenters and shoemakers. There is an inn and two retail shops are to be immediately erected. We believe £150 was recently paid for a one-acre block in Murray Street. We know of no place where investment in land, housing or almost any business is surer to yield a handsome return. Barossa farmers are now making a detour of twelve miles to go via Gawler to avoid the execrable mountain road via Chain of Ponds.</p>
<p>11 October 1845, page 2</p>
<p>Opening of the Monster Copper Mine</p>
<p>A few days ago we said the SA Mining Assoc. had sent a party of men to the Burra Creek to commence operations at what is now generally known as the Monster Copper Mine. A gentleman formerly connected with the paper has since visited the site and brings back more flattering accounts of the prospects of success that those hitherto received.</p>
<p>Last Saturday he found four dray loads of ore had already been sent to Adelaide and ten loads were piled up ready to be sent. Eight men only had raised this in a single week.</p>
<p>The face of the hill has been opened in three places:</p>
<p>About 100-150 yards above the ‘bunch of ore’ giving rise to the Monster Mine.</p>
<p>At the extreme lower end of that bunch of ore on the surface.</p>
<p>300 to 400 yards below it, near the base of the hill.</p>
<p>At the first site a square hole 4 or 5 ft in width found ore near the surface and further development was deferred.</p>
<p>At the second site a rich start par excellence resulted in an opening some 16 ft wide and 6 ft deep was made and in following the ore this increased to 21 ft wide and no depth limit has yet been found.</p>
<p>The third site had an opening some 15 ft wide by 5 ft deep and from it a mass of ore equal in quality to the Monster Lode has already been raised.</p>
<p>The limits to these ore bodies have not yet been ascertained.</p>
<p>Another batch of miners has been sent up and it is expected they will be able to produce 60-80 tons of ore per week for some time to come.</p>
<p>This success immediately poses the problem of transporting the ore to Adelaide and then of its shipment to England. The amount predicted above would require about 60 teams of bullocks (at 8 per team) to move the ore to Adelaide. Then there is the need to find shipping to England.</p>
<p>A spring of first rate water has been found only a few hundred yards from the mine, with an excellent site for a township adjacent.</p>
<p>The Directors should lose no time in laying out a town and administering to the comforts of the men, for in this area the heat is as intense as the employment is exhausting.</p>
<p>The quality of the ore may be inspected at Mr Stocks’s stores. The shareholders of the Mining Assoc. have good reason to congratulate themselves on their prospects of success.</p>
<p>18 October 1845, page 2</p>
<p>Mining Companies</p>
<p>[The article reports the formation in England of the ‘Australian Mining Company,’ with a local committee of management comprising G.A. Anstey, John Baker, Jacob Hagan and John Hart. It aims to produce copper. A second company called ‘The Australasian Mines Royal Company’ is mentioned and it is thought they might merge.</p>
<p>SA Mining Assoc. announces ten miners have raised 200 tons of ore worth over £400 in twelve days and the principle lode has been found to be ‘of enormous dimensions’. Sixteen of the £5 shares this week brought a 150% premium.</p>
<p>29 October 1845, page 3</p>
<p>The Monster Mine</p>
<p>The Directors of SA Mining Assoc. have returned to Adelaide delighted with their visit to the mines. One hundred tons had been despatched and twenty more drays were passed going up. Seventeen drays arrived at Pt Adelaide yesterday and now 150-200 tons of ore are ready for shipment.</p>
<p>The site for a smelting house for comparatively inferior ore has been fixed and one street of the town has been laid out with sites for twelve cottages.</p>
<p>The first lode of Wheal Grey has been opened: 34 ft long by 27 ft wide and on Saturday it was 5 ft 7 inches deep. The floor is a continuous mass of ore.</p>
<p>Stocks’s Lode varies from 8 to 11 feet in width and is 31 ft long.</p>
<p>Beck’s Lode is so far 17 ft long by 7 ft broad and 5 ft deep.</p>
<p>Graham’s Lode, Penny’s Lode and others are only partly examined.</p>
<p>The directors have opened a native spring about 11⁄2 miles from the township. It has been ascertained to yield 700 gallons of good water per day. The directors brought with them some splendid specimens of ore. Shares in the SA Mining Assoc. are changing hands at a premium of 220%.</p>
<p>5 November 1845, page 3</p>
<p>The Monster Mine</p>
<p>[The article begins with another set of production figures.]</p>
<p>Fifteen miners out of 40 employed, have raised 500 tons of ore in seven weeks. The visible quantities of ore are cited as worth an aggregate of £68,600. Reported disagreements between the German Superintendent and the miners seem to have arisen solely from mutual misunderstandings based on language difficulties between the two.</p>
<p>The present supply of potable water is abundant.</p>
<p>The proprietors of the southern half of the Special Survey are providing comfortable accommodation for their present and future workers by numerous erections and they are well assured that the richness of their territory will afford them the most ample remuneration.</p>
<p>Nothing is yet known of the exploration party, which has gone so far north as Messrs White’s Station, some 150 miles from Adelaide.</p>
<p>12 November 1845, page 2</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine. It is reported that a difference has sprung up between the proprietors of the Burra Burra Mine and the men employed. We are not acquainted with the cause.</p>
<p>[The paper then warns both sides of the danger on the one hand of seeking to extract more income than is justified or on the other hand of underpaying workers.]</p>
<p>19 November 1845, page 2</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mine. Since the commencement of operations ores to the value of £5,000 or half the cost of this half of the Special Survey have been raised at the Burra Burra Mine. The £5 shares are currently valued at £30 and few have been prepared to sell even at that price.</p>
<p>10 December 1845, page 2</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine. A country carrier reports after his first load of ore from Burra that the natural road of over 90 miles is well adapted for heavy traffic. The short sandy patches, which would be unfavourable for horses, offer no problems for bullocks. He was surprised at how quickly he and others were loaded and also at the vastness of the deposits apparent to the eye. He earned £12 in twelve days.</p>
<p>17 December 1845, page 3</p>
<p>Weather. [The article reports on damage done by a storm the previous Sunday to the southern part of the North Road, placing it in a dreadful state. The paper considered it was quite time the Government acted to improve the road for the sake of the great importance to the province’s ‘sheepmasters’ and more recently to the mining properties too.]</p>
<p>24 December 1845, page 2</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>Reports from other visitors to the Burra Burra Mines fully support the statements of the Directors.</p>
<p>In four weeks ending 13 December 1845 358 tons of ore were raised; 190 from Penny’s Load.</p>
<p>Discoveries of native copper in a state of extreme purity are becoming increasingly frequent and indications of great and enduring wealth are daily produced.</p>
<p>The line of natural road is of general remark.</p>
<p>There is nothing new to report from Princess Royal Mines, but a small quantity of ore sent in gives every promise of quality and we understand the existence of copper in great quantity is no longer in doubt, though it is at present less tangible than the treasures of the Burra Burra Mine.</p>

<p>A man recently there reports a single explosion that released 30 tons of ore valued at £600. Some experienced tributers are said to be earning over £7 a week and one confident report goes so far as to make one class of earnings equal to £50 per month per man.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines Reports suggest a production of £2,000 worth a week with the present work force and we are assured this is in fact short of reasonable probability.</p>

<p>A Burra Burra Mines Shareholder, it is said, has been offered £10,000 for his £2,000 outlay, and it is reported he has declined, saying he had no doubt his £2,000 would one day realise £10,000 p.a. for him.</p>
<p>4 February 1846, page 2</p>
<p>‘Spectator’ writes in a highly critical tone of the way bidding was run up to exorbitant figures in the recent auction of blocks of land north and south of the Burra Special Survey.</p>
<p>640 acres of copper ore land at the south end of the Burra Burra Survey and 367 acres [sic: for 347] at the northern end have been sold for £7-15-0 and £15 per acre respectively. It is said an agent for a London Company with a capital of £400,000 ran the prices this high.</p>
<p>The proprietors of the southern half of the Special Survey bought the 640 acres adjacent to their property to include a certain spring of water. The northern proprietors apparently thought it gentlemanly to allow the southern proprietors a claim to this area. It is a pity the London Company had not ‘the same delicacy of perception’. The only effect of the bidding on the northern area on offer was unnecessarily to run up the price to the benefit of the Government.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines. Remarkable among the operations of the Burra Burra Mines are eight miners who joined together to raise ore from one of the main shafts for a contract price of 30/- per ton for two months. They cleared £70-£80 each and left the company with nearly 200 tons of ore not equal to the terms of the contract, but which can profitably be smelted on the spot. A new contract has been entered into at the much reduced rate of 15/- per ton. So far the greatest number of hands employed has been about 140.</p>
<p>11 March 1846, page 2</p>
<p>The want of wells along the road to the Burra Burra Mines was most marked in the hot days of last week and among the many bullocks conveying copper ore, several casualties occurred.</p>

<p>Princess Royal Mines. Several miners from these mines made a visit to town last week. Some intended to return with their wives and others with household goods that might attract fair acquaintances to share with them the pleasures of a bush life. The village at Princess Royal is well situated and abundantly supplied with water. Operations are proceeding vigorously upon a large lode of rich ore at a depth of about twelve fathoms. The general prospects of the mine are encouraging for the proprietors.</p>
<p>At the Burra Burra Mines some of the men contracted to raise a quantity of prime ore at 15/- per ton are likely to realise handsome earnings.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>A report in the Perth Inquirer of 18 February says the Burra Burra Mine is the wonder of the world: it exceeds the celebrated Pargo Mine in the ratio of a million to one. The ore is 75% metal – a pure oxide needing no flux to smelt it. The lode is 17 ft wide and of vast extent. Ten weeks’ work has sufficed to produce £17,000 value of ore. [This and further hyperbole.]</p>

<p>Mr John Roberts, engineer, has invented a means of creating by mechanical means an enlargement at the end of a hole bored for blasting.

<p>The 1st Annual Meeting of SAMA was held at the Auction Mart Tavern in Hindley Street, Adelaide, 15 April: Charles Beck, Chairman.</p>
<p>The Directors reported that the prospects of the Association have far exceeded their most sanguine expectations.</p>
<p>In six months ore fit for exportation was: 1933 tons</p>
<p>Ore reserved for smelting was: 723 tons</p>
<p>Of the ore fit for exportation 1799 tons had arrived at Pt Adelaide</p>
<p>118 tons was on the road</p>
<p>65 tons was at he mine</p>
<p>On 28 March 1197 tons had been shipped to England</p>
<p>9 tons had been sold</p>
<p>590 tons was on hand at the port</p>
<p>Much more ore was raised in the past three months than in the three month previous and the quality of the ore is much improved.</p>
<p>The workings and operations of the mine were highly satisfactory so far as the Directors could judge from reports and personal observation. At present workings consisted of 15 shafts from 14 to 79 ft in depth and 14 galleries varying from 15 ft to 240 ft in length.</p>
<p>The Directors were making every exertion for the completion of the smelting works, but building had been delayed by a want of bricks and of masons as well as the need to build cottages for miners and their families before the onset of winter, but they hoped is a short time to begin smelting operations.</p>
<p>The Directors had increased the size of the township of Kooringa to 40 acres. Four stone cottages were finished and occupied and twenty-two others were in the course of erection. There were also many temporary huts and houses. The Directors have in contemplation the erection of a school-house, which may be used as a place of worship and the Government intends establishing a police station. The Directors have leased ten acres of land for the purpose of building a hotel and have purchased sections 2002, 2402 and 3200 in the County of Light on the mine road, with a view to letting them for a similar purpose so that much greater facilities will be afforded to carriers.</p>
<p>The mining captain could not attend to all the duties of general superintendence as well as to the mining and so the Directors appointed Samuel Stocks Jnr to the office of Resident Director at a salary of £400 p.a. The Directors have not delegated to him any power deputed to them by scrip holders, so he is as much under the authority of the Board of Directors as if he was not a member. He took up office in February last, since when there has been a very satisfactory improvement in the management of the mines and a very great saving in expense.</p>
<p>The Directors have not thought it advisable to make an estimate of the real worth of the Association property until the first account sales of the ore is received, which will undoubtedly be before the next meeting of scrip holders.</p>
<p>The accounts for the working of the Burra Burra Mines amount to £4,495-11-11, for which upwards of 2,700 tons of ore have been raised.</p>
<p>Directors to retire by rotation are Messrs Penny, Bunce, Neales and Paxton and as Mr Emanuel Solomon has also resigned, he will need to be replaced.</p>

<p>Proposed Copper Smelting Company (From the South Australian 28 July)</p>
<p>A meeting was held on Saturday at the Auction Mart Hotel. About twelve gentlemen attended with Captain Bagot MLC in the chair.</p>
<p>Dr Davy laid on the table calculations as to the cost of establishing a works on sufficient scale to give the operation a fair trial and also an estimate of the cost of charcoal and coal and the quantities needed for a ton of ore to be smelted. These were partly based on small scale experiments and partly on the experience of other smelting operations. He was sure they were accurate enough to justify the establishment of a works on a large scale. [These calculations are printed.]</p>
<p>Those most acquainted with the mines concluded that if the calculations were borne out by the results, the value of the mining property would be enhanced by at least 50%. Dr Davy proposed the works be established at Port Adelaide, it being the most convenient place for the reception of ores and the fuel required. An unlimited quantity of charcoal could be got from Kangaroo Island and York’s [sic] Peninsula. After discussion there was general support for Dr Davy’s plan and agreement that the establishment of a smelter was highly desirable. A committee was formed of Captain Bagot, J. Baker, John Hart, M. Smith, Henry Collier, John Ellis, James Bunce, Charles Beck and Dr Davy and they are requested to make arrangements for a trial of the proposal. A subscription list was instituted.</p>
<p>[The Editor expressed the view that the prospects of success were even more favourable that the Doctor and his associates had ventured to suggest.]</p>

<p>A punt formed of bull’s hide has been used to ferry one or more horsemen across the river at Gawler in the prevalent floods. [The horses having to swim.] The River Light is also in flood and a driver lost his life trying to ford it.</p>
<p>The Smelting Company Proposal</p>
<p>People seem sceptical about the prospects of successful smelting in SA judging from the tardiness with which the subscription list is proceeding. Had Mr Smith’s proposal to form a company with capital of £10,000 in £5 shares been carried into effect it is probable shares would have readily been taken up. But when offered in the form of a subscription list a perception is that the money is being given away for a public purpose, as if for charity and that few, except those deeply interested in the mines, are called upon to subscribe, which unfortunately is delaying the carrying out of the objective. In fact the subscribers are bona fide shareholders with their deposits paid. We hope the public will see it this way and that the list will soon be filled up.</p>
<p>19 August 1846, page 1</p>
<p>Smelting. The promoters of the Smelting Company held their third meeting on 12 August. [Subscribers and the sums subscribed are listed to a total of £660.]</p>
<p>The plan is that upon successful testing of Dr Davy’s operations, subscribers will have the option to claim shares in the company it is intended to form, in the ratio of their subscriptions. The reason for the subscription system is so that no subscriber would be implicated in the undertaking beyond the amount subscribed.</p>

<p>Local Improvements in SA</p>
<p>[This is a long article outlining developments across the colony. It begins with a lengthy description of the erection of much needed new cottage housing in the city and goes on to describe many new hotels, shops and other businesses. With more direct relevance to Burra are the following items mentioned.]</p>
<p>J.B. Graham, one of the SA Mining Association’s largest shareholders, is about to build an elegant villa, designed by the architect Mr Price, at Prospect Village. It will be on several acres of land with extensive gardens. Mr Bouch, who is also about to require intends to build at Prospect as well.</p>
<p>Gawler Town is rapidly growing, in part due to the increasing traffic to and from the mines. The proprietors of Calton’s Hotel there are about to erect a new roadside inn at a probable cost exceeding £2,000. Income from land sales is allowing the Government to invest in public works and £2,500 has been allocated to the building of a stone bridge at Gawler. [Other Government expenditures on a wide range of items are listed.]</p>
<p>On the road leading north to the Mines Mr Templar of Adelaide is building a large roadside inn.</p>
<p>On the Gilbert the tavern of Mr Lamb has changed hands and is about to be enlarged.</p>
<p>At Burra Burra itself Mr Paxton, a large shareholder, is erecting a spacious tavern, which is likely to prove one of the most profitable speculations that gentleman has ever engaged in.</p>
<p>The new township at the Burra Burra Mines is in rapid course of formation and population and as the number of inhabitants will shortly be several hundreds, the local supply of their wants will be sure not only to attract, but attach traders to the spot, whilst the growth and preparation of ‘bread stuff’, the providing of dairy produce for the immediate market and of fat animals for the butcher, will necessarily foster in the neighbourhood the pursuit of agriculture, grazing and farming.</p>

<p>Royalties – The SA Mining Company Protests. (From the SA Gazette, 3 October.)</p>
<p>On 23 September the local directors of the SA Mining Company, Messrs J. Baker, G.A. Anstey &amp; Captain Hart, with Mr Gwynne the legal adviser for the company, proceeded to the Registry Office to protest against the imposition of royalties and the conditions of their land grant offered to them for the special survey at Reedy Creek. They only accepted the land grant under protest, for fear of losing the survey to another party.</p>
<p>[The reporter then goes on to describe the ‘most outrageous violation of the rights of the colonists.’]</p>
<p>The point of their objection was that the company had paid £20,000 for 20,000 acres believing in good faith that it included all ‘timber, minerals and appurtenances.’ The payment of their purchase was effected in England on 11 July 1845, but on 5 March 1846 the SA Government Gazette announced that the Lieutenant Governor had imposed a mineral reserve of royalty of one fifteenth portion of all metals and ores containing metals on or under the waste lands of the province: effective immediately. In accepting the land grant they registered their denial of the legitimacy of this act as not being authorised by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. [Their protest in all its convoluted and protracted legal terminology is printed.]</p>

<p>South Australian Mining Association (SAMA)</p>
<p>We have considerable gratification from perusing the half-yearly report of SAMA as it appears today in our advertising columns. The report presents important and undeniable facts, but is of necessity deficient in financial returns, of which the English advices are still in abeyance.</p>
<p>On 18 April we ventured to print from an unofficial source the expectation that the probable first half-year profit would be £64,528-4-2.</p>
<p>Up to the publication of the Directors’ Report those gentlemen had not received advice in respect of any of the cargoes sent to England.</p>
<p>The new calculations by ‘our correspondent’ are attached. [A new series of figures is printed.]</p>
<p>In them he presumes the profit for the first year will be £85,515-16-6.</p>
<p>Since the number of shares is 2,464 the profit will be £34-14-0 per share (if all the figures above can be realised).</p>
<p>It has not infrequently been asserted that the mine’s productivity is unlikely to be continued at increased depths and that the prospects of a southward extension were not cheering. But operations in September have shown increased production, the quality of ore is maintained if not superior and extensions have continued at depth and in length.</p>
<p>Also the Princess Royal operations have met with increased success, which gives assurance that further discoveries will realise the chain of mineral wealth that has been theoretically described as continuous throughout the lands of the Princess Royal Mining Company and those of the SAMA.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal operations are encouraging.</p>
<p>The company at Burra Burra has raised 1,100 tons in the month, which at £16 per ton on the mine (a price perhaps ridiculously low) gives £17,600 as the proceeds for one month’s work, or £211,200 per annum, being £31,200 in advance of proceeds for the business year last expired, which have confidently been stated at £180,000.</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt the mine is to go on yielding in astonishing profusion.</p>
<p>The Directors who (except for the Chairman Mr Charles Beck) are not named in the report are: Messrs Charles Beck (Chairman), Stocks (Resident Director), Bunce, Graham, Featherstone, Peacock, Paxton, W. Allen and Waterhouse.</p>

<p>[This article is a wordy puffing of the prospects of the colony. It cites again the estimate that the Burra Burra Mines would produce a clear income of £85,515-18-10, or a return of 694% on the capital invested. This is based on an average price in England of £24 per ton. It says information received suggests this is more than likely to be the case.]</p>

<p>William Argent of Angas Park allowed William Riley to use his dray to take a load of wool to town for his employer, Mr William Roberts of Greenock Creek. Having delivered the wool, Riley then sold the poor man’s dray and pocketed the proceeds. Argent had been intending to go to the Burra Burra Mines immediately on the return of the dray; to earn a good and honest living carting ore to the port and this action entirely ruined his prospects. The law viewed the action as a breach of trust and not a criminal offence. A civil action was not only beyond Argent’s means, but Riley had absconded. Fortunately for the honest and industrious Argent some gentlemen, knowing of his excellent character, have provided the means of purchasing a new dray.</p>

<p>Inquest held at the Plough and Harrow in Rundle Street on the body of a child Richard Thomas Burn aged 9, son of Richard Burn of Burra Burra Mines. The child died as the result of the falling of some earth upon which planks had been laid for the purpose of removing ore as it was raised from one of the shafts. The child had been sent with some candles for his father and was going home when the accident occurred. The boy was found by his father buried beneath several feet of earth and was quite dead, having been buried for some hours. The death was apparently due to suffocation and no broken bones or wounds were found. The body was taken to Adelaide, but was so much decomposed that meaningful examination by the Colonial Surgeon was impracticable. The jury found that death was accidental, but that the shoring of the chambers in the mine was insecure and they expressed a hope that more attention would be paid to the security of life in the future.</p>

There was some conversation between the Magistrate and some men from Burra Burra. The latter said that the orders pass in Kooringa in the way bank notes pass in Adelaide.

<p>Letter from ‘A Labouring Man’</p>
<p>It is commonly said that in SA labour is scarce and overpaid. I shall demonstrate that it is not too highly remunerated. A Member of the Legislative Council has said that if workingmen’s wages were increased it would lead to drunkenness and immorality. In SA mines, the agricultural trade, sheep farming etc. are yielding great profits. Labour is the capital of the working man. Let us see how that capital is being remunerated. The rate of wages is £1 to £1-2-0 per week. Allow a man and wife with three children (about the average). Let us see what his necessary costs are.</p>
<p>Rent of a cottage 3-6</p>
<p>1⁄2 load of water 1-0</p>
<p>Wood 1-0</p>
<p>Oil 3</p>
<p>11⁄4 lb soap 6</p>
<p>1⁄2 lb tea 1-0</p>
<p>3 lb sugar 9</p>
<p>1 pint milk/day 1-2</p>
<p>1 lb butter 3</p>
<p>Bread 5 lb/day 5-3</p>
<p>Vegetables 1-2</p>
<p>Meat 18 lb @ 31⁄2d lb 5-3</p>
<p>£1-1-11</p>
<p>I am confident these cost will bear scrutiny. Surely the poor man should have sufficient in excess of these necessities as would clothe him and his family and give some little education to his children. He cannot do this at the present rate of wages. There are calls for the richer population to fund charity education. Can the labourer be being paid too well when his children must be educated by charity? Under these circumstances it is too bad to be mocked by men in the Legislative Council and to be told by the press of the dearth and scarcity of labour, but not a word about the high cost of rents nor the high price of fuel and every article of consumption. During the past two year the cost of items which benefit the capitalist have increased by 100 to 150%, while wages have risen 10 to 15%, showing at what ratio the working man participates in the prosperity of the colony.</p>

<p>A Visit to the Northern Mines of SA</p>
<p>We started from Adelaide in a rather extraordinary looking covered vehicle, ponderous and springless with three horses abreast. We left at 2.30 p.m. Thursday 12 November and headed north on the great North Road. Beyond the windmill there is a very pleasant-looking road-side inn and at the little village which has grown up in the Pine Forest we saw several neat and almost genteel residences. The Primitive Methodists have a neat chapel there, which is well attended. Further on there is a neat and commodious inn kept by Mr Isaac Jepp and near it a steam flour mill, at present unemployed due to the recent bursting of its boiler. The projected stone bridge over the Dry Creek is as yet only a pile of stones and the apologetic present bridge on a circuitous road into Dry Creek Village is a sad affair. Not so the inn of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith, which is ‘in such deserved repute’. The traveller on the road to the Little Para is surprised to see the number of wildly circuitous tracks [needed to avoid boggy patches.]</p>
<p>The Little Para Bridge is susceptible of much improvement, though very passable compared with some we have seen in SA. The direct route over the Gawler Plains is made disagreeable by the stony ridges, which the soil only partly covers.</p>
<p>We reached Gawler Town after dark and passed the bed of the South Para, not without some degree of hazard. £2,400 has been provided here for a bridge to be constructed as soon as willing contractors and masons can be found. Gawler is a very thriving place with several shops, a steam flour mill and three good inns. Calton’s is the oldest and deserves its priority, although Cleland’s and Donnelly’s are ‘very good both’. In the morning we resumed our journey, stopping at the unfinished, but promising inn newly occupied by Mr &amp; Mrs Templar, late of Adelaide. Our next stop was at the River Light where there is no inn. The water was scarcely good enough for tea and the pasture so insufficient that tether ropes and hobbles were needed for the horses. We had hoped to reach an inn called ‘The Stone Hut’ for the night, but there was so much rain and lightning that we groped our way to one of Mr Masters’ sheep stations and were given shelter for the night by a shepherd’s wife in a Spartan, but clean hut and were supplied with a comfortable repast. After breakfasting we journeyed on to The Stone Hut, later known as the Saddleworth Arms and now as the Miner’s Arms, so named by those operatives going to and from the Monster Mine. The main building of two storeys and built of stone is ready to receive a roof as soon as carpenters and shinglers can be got to put it on. In the meantime business is conducted in the extensive lean-to at the back by Mr &amp; Mrs Uphill, under much disadvantage and inconvenience.</p>
<p>The next stopping place was at a station of Mr Price Maurice’s, near his snug cottage residence. The supply of water is from a newly sunk well. Our next stage was to the Black Springs where Mr Cudmore, the well-known brewer and maltster, is engaged in the erection of a tavern and brewery. The beer was new and the fare homely, but both went down with relish. From Mr Cudmore’s to the ‘Sod Hut’ the drive was very interesting. The route is remarkable and picturesque, but not sylvan. It is interesting also from the traffic, which had awakened the silent echoes of the mountainous recesses. We met a great number of loaded drays from the Burra Burra Mines, some containing 2-3 tons of green malachite ore and drawn by eight bullocks, having the appearance at a little distance of huge loads of green vegetables going to market.</p>
<p>The Sod Hut is a sorry halting place. It has been unroofed by the hands of wanton despoilers and the natural supply of water is become scant and muddy. It was dark enough before we left the Sod Hut a mile behind and at that point and several others along our journey we found several bullock drays and horse vehicles drawn up for the night beside the fires of their drivers or passengers. By pursuing the beaten and generally level track we soon reached the tavern at Kooringa, located at a distance of three-quarters of a mile from the principal workings – the unprecedented success of which has conduced so much to South Australia’s wealth and celebrity and whose undoubted successful continuance will confirm those impression ‘which have set forth the copper mine of Burra Burra as “the richest of the kind in the known world.”’</p>
<p>It was nearly 10 p.m. when we reached the tavern and found the landlord, Mr Wren busy ejecting a multitude of obstreperous customers. The present temporary establishment is soon to give place to a handsome hotel, which will comprise sixteen commodious apartments ‘besides perhaps some of those subsidiary bed-rooms which are such useful appendages to the public houses of entertainment in South Australian times of congregation’. The basement is already formed of capital stonework and the superstructure will be of the same durable material.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning we took an early walk and obtained a glimpse of the mine from the summit of an intervening hill, but we were closely immured for the rest of the day by incessant heavy rain. Early next morning our breakfast was cut short by the announcement that Captain Lawson was waiting to accompany us underground at the principal workings. Having provided ourselves with subterranean toggery, we hastened to accompany our guide.</p>
<p>The huge cargoes which have been shipped, the piles of ore at the port, the hundreds of draught oxen and laden drays we had seen en route, the thousand of tons of ore around the workings and the amount near the intended smelting house, had prepared us to expect much, but before we had passed through a single gallery, as the larger horizontal drivages or levels are properly called, we had seen enough to convince us we had commenced the examination of a mine incomparably richer than any mine of any kind we had ever seen in the United Kingdom. We passed through a succession of galleries and chambers. In our progress we had to ascend successive perpendicular ladders with a lighted candle retained between the forefinger and the thumb and afterwards to make our descent by similar contrivance and others much more rude, until in divers wendings, twistings, turnings etc. we had spent nearly three hours underground and passed through the greater part of the operations.</p>
<p>As correctly described in the last half-yearly report of the Directors:</p>
<p>‘The present openings or workings consist of twenty mine shafts or winzes, the deepest being one hundred and forty-four feet (at which depth a lode of very rich ore has recently been cut), and they amount in the aggregate to one thousand eight hundred and sixty feet in depth, also seventy galleries or levels, the united length of which measure seven thousand nine hundred and ninety-two feet or rather more than a mile and a half.’</p>
<p>Subsequent operations have not been without commensurate results and we counted more than the number of shafts and winzes mentioned and, while we could not measure the length of the levels, drivages and excavations, we were convinced they were much longer than the mile and a half described. The ladders were so well contrived that we did not often have to trust to the kibble and the rope.</p>
<p>The Directors estimate the total quantity of ore raised in the twelve months to 20 November as 7,200 tons, but as in calculating the small ores retained for smelting at the mine at 1,462 tons, they were greatly below the mark, we may safely revise the estimate to 10,000 tons. The sales of ore at Swansea already show an average value of something over £23-16-0 per ton, so that even deducting £8-16-0 per ton for carriage, freight and charges, the mine may be said to have yielded at least £150,000 estimated upon the ground, or as the miners say ‘at grass’. And this within 13 months from commencement. Nor is this large amount likely to be a maximum. The mine is undoubtedly equal to the production of 300 tons or more per week of ores likely to yield a much higher average than heretofore. It is not hard to see the immensity of future returns.</p>
<p>The importance of the operation as beneficially affecting the trade and commerce of the colony may already be judged. The sum already distributed amongst our industrious settlers for carriage must have exceeded £10,000 and that expended in wages and other disbursements £20,000 and in the British and Colonial freights cannot be less than £15,000.</p>
<p>It is also pleasing to state that not a single fatality has occurred to any miner employed at the Burra Burra Mines since operations began. This is due to the care of the resident managers to see that every precaution is used and no cost spared in securing the ground, which in some places is precarious enough to call for constant watchfulness. Stuhl timbers of gum 10-12 inches in diameter were freely provided and stout head and foot pieces.</p>
<p>Productive hands are variously employed – some upon tribute – the highest proportion given being 3/6 in the pound for the value of ores raised, and the lowest 2/-. Others are paid by the ton for ‘hard ore’, with prices varying from 18/- to 27/6. Preparatory miners and labourers operate upon what is called tut work or so much per fathom, or in specific jobs or at per day on owners’ account or in labour subsidiary to and chargeable upon the takers or contracting miners below.</p>
<p>A census taken a day or two before we reached the mines revealed 238 men, 70 women and 160 children for a total population of 468. In addition the mines create other employment in the district for sawyers, carters, charcoal burners etc. and these, it is thought, would bring the district population to about 550.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for a person with missionary zeal in the community. The place also needs an exemplary schoolmaster and schoolmistress, who would find themselves sufficiently, if not liberally paid. ‘It behoves the Directors to take means without delay, for supplying the moral and spiritual wants of the young community, which the Association has called into existence.’</p>
<p>Samuel Stocks Jnr is the Resident Director and is very generally called the ‘Governor’ and his house is called by some ‘Government House’. It has a substantial stone gable and chimney, which reminds us that the first Government House built for Governor Hindmarsh was begun, if not finished, without such useful appendages. Mr Stocks has been as markedly successful as he is generally respected.</p>
<p>The surgeon, although well paid by direct stipend and monthly or occasional contributions, has evidently no sinecure and finds it necessary to hold himself in constant requisition.</p>
<p>The mounted police force is only three in number: a sergeant and two constables. Their conduct is excellent and their temper, management and promptitude most praiseworthy.</p>
<p>The township of Kooringa is principally composed of substantially-built houses, constructed of stone quarried within the township and flagged with excellent material raised (we believe) upon the property of the Association at a distance of a few miles. That Kooringa will be a very thriving place there can be little doubt. At first sight the paucity of wood and the lack of visible water supply appear to militate against domestic comfort, but when we learned that the employees of the Association are supplied with water at 6d a week and wood at the like easy rate, we became more convinced that in these as in other respects there was more than met the eye. An accurate weigh bridge has recently been put down at the mine and every precaution seems to be used to produce a just impression of fairness between master and man. By the present arrangements the labourer can purchase his weekly requirements wherever he finds he has best advantage. Although the profits of the Kooringa storekeepers are still good, they have ceased to be exorbitant.</p>
<p>Good stone masons and wallers are in demand at 7/- a day or 4/6 per cubic yard, finding their own materials. Mason’s labourers earn 5/- a day. Carpenters are paid 35 to 45 shillings a week and Sawyers 10/6 a hundred. Carriage to the port is £2-15-0 per ton of 21 cwt. There is no lack of carriers. Monday presentation is nothing short of 60 drays and 360 bullocks. The charcoal on hand fills a charcoal store 150 ft in length by 27 ft in width.</p>
<p>We closed our observations at Burra Burra with an examination of the contiguous property called “the Sydney Company’s” at which little has been done and then prepared for departure on the morrow.</p>
<p>At noon on Tuesday we set out for the southern portion of the Special Survey of 20,000 acres, on which is located the Princess Royal Mine. About 30 men are there employed and something more than 200 tons of good ores have been sent. It appeared that with a little more spirit and perseverance 2,000 and then 20,000 tons might follow. We inspected as many of the shafts as time allowed and especially the one sunk upon the original ‘monster lode’ upon the margin of a forest of stunted pine. ‘The fast possession of abundant treasure is decisive, although it is not so instantly tangible as at the Burra Burra.’ A beautiful lawn was pointed out as the intended site for the Princess Royal Township, which will have the advantage of an excellent supply of water from a neighbouring spring. The present snug establishment is pleasantly located on the Burra Creek.</p>
<p>The route from Kooringa to Princess Royal and then south traverses the creek for several miles and then crosses an abrupt, but comparatively insignificant ridge called ‘the Saddle’ through which a passage has been cut and then it follows a flat. We venture to say that 50 of the 100 miles from Adelaide to Burra Burra would travel over very easy grades with the capacity for cheap construction. We encamped the night at Tothill’s Gap, where we found several drays going to or returning from the mines. At 5.15 a.m. we were on the move and made our way through one of Mr Dutton’s sheep stations to the Light. This we crossed at a point far removed from that on our northbound journey and we passed the woolshed of Messrs Newland &amp; Co. to reach Kapunda.</p>
<p>The Kapunda is a wonderful mine. The underground workings are for the greater part suspended in consequence of the insufficiency of the principal whim machinery for keeping under the water and the non-arrival of a steam engine ordered from England by the proprietors. Some 60-70 tons per week at an average of mere than £20 per ton are even now sent from this rich mine. The kinds of ore produced her offer a remarkable variety, comprising grey sulphuret with green carbonate producing 50% or more, black sulphuret with green carbonate 23-60%, pale green carbonate 26-48%, blue carbonate (hydrocarbonate) 20-30%, grey carbonate with red oxide 28%, dark green carbonate 30% and others of lesser value. The location is picturesque.</p>
<p>Mr J.B. Hack is the resident Superintendent and the mine has the appearance of good management. Single miners are provided with board and lodging at 10/- per week. The much wanted inn about a mile from the mine is now nearly ready for occupation and it is to be hoped that the intervening country between it and Gawler Town will not long be without a half-way house.</p>
<p>At Gawler Town we found the first annual races had commenced. Attendance, though not large, was greater than we expected to find. A number of Aborigines were present and a German brass band whose members were also miners.</p>
<p>Since our return we have spoken to a man who says Mt Remarkable copper exhibits abundance and all that can be desired for quality and the riches at Emu Springs are described as almost indescribable. Mt Barker and the eastern districts are said to have undoubted riches too.</p>
<p>2 December 1846, page 3</p>
<p>Astonishing Traffic on the North Road</p>
<p>At Mr Templar’s new tavern, one stage beyond Gawler, the following was seen about noon three weeks ago: 11 drays laden with wool, 2 saddle horses, 2 horse vehicles and 18 drays with copper bound for Port Adelaide. A few Sundays ago over 50 drays going or coming from the Burra Burra Mines were halted at Uphill’s unfinished tavern between the Light and the Black Springs.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>The present pitch ends 23 December for the Christmas holidays. Meanwhile cartage of the ore continues and great heaps are at the mine, so there is no danger of drays standing still. Carters if they wish may work through the holidays. An immense load of purest malachite has just been struck and the prospects of the mine are more brilliant than ever.</p>

He says everyone seems to have a pocket of pebbles about which they can boast and concerning whose origins they are most secretive. They make comments like: ‘I wouldn’t take £50 for my knowledge at the present moment.’ The writer also suggests that some of the locals are not above salting some prospective mine sites to delude would-be buyers or investors.]</p>

<p>Runaway Sailors</p>
<p>[This article reveals that captains are having troubles with sailors deserting their vessels. This not only leads to costly delays, but may lead to the ship sailing with unknown and incompetent crew in place of sailors who had been hand-picked for the job. It then goes on to consider the state of the law on the matter. One possible solution suggested is a sort of pass or passport. Several masters had sent a Memorial to the Lieutenant Governor H.E. Frederick Holt Robe Esq. concerning the inefficacy of the present law.]</p>

<p>The Resident Magistrate’s Court</p>
<p>[This article complains about the injustice arising from the rules of the court. A Burra Burra man whose wife is living in Adelaide is deemed to have been served with a summons if it is left at her house and judgement might be taken by default, even though he actually knew nothing about the matter. Neither do the rules allow the wife to attend for him. The legal solution is expensive involving the use of a barrister (at a guinea) to file an affidavit and to get permission for the summons to be sent to Burra Burra (on the payment of the day’s cost) with time granted to allow him to come to Adelaide, which involves the loss of a weeks wages: perhaps all for being sued for a debt, which the law and justice then declare him not to owe. This clearly relates to actual instances of 23 December in Breaker v. Morris and Regan v. Ovens. The Magistrate on appropriate application granted three weeks for entering the appearance, but was blithely unconcerned about the costs inflicted by the process.]</p>

<p>Election of Resident Director for Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>Yesterday being the day for the election of a General Superintendent for the Burra Burra Mines due to the resignation of S. Stocks [Jnr] much curiosity prevailed as to the outcome. There were more than 20 candidates. No official announcement has been made, but it has been intimated to us that Mr Chipman, a passenger on the Royal Archer was elected to the office of Superintendent at £350 and Mr Roach, recently arrived from Cornwall, has been engaged to control underground operations at £225.</p>

<p>Port Adelaide-Swansea Trade</p>
<p>We have been glad to hear of discussions concerning direct trading between Port Adelaide and Swansea, undertaken by a prominent business person of Swansea. The main obstacle is obtaining outward cargoes from Swansea. While Swansea provides only a brief list of exports, the railways now growing in the area must furnish additional manufactures and merchandise. Such matters should also improve from the floating harbour, which it is intended to construct there in substitution for the tidal one now in use. Many shippers avoid the port because of the need [of shipping] to lie on the ground. In any case 40 to 50 vessels of 300-650 tons have been regularly employed in the copper trade from Cuba and Valparaiso and none has sustained damage in the harbour.</p>
<p>23 January 1847, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>Some months ago we refrained from attending a meeting of the company, believing its proceedings were considered private. The next day directors and shareholders said they were surprised at our absence, as their transactions were not secret. On Wednesday, however, had our reporter not himself had a voting certificate, he would not have been admitted. We protest against this secrecy, which is not followed by the old companies in England such as the Bank and the East India Company. The mining interests in SA have absorbed so much capital that if they are unattended with returns it would constitute a dangerous leak in a very little ship. The proceedings of the company are thus of legitimate general interest and not only to scrip-holders, but to those many who often hold scrip or inducements to defer claims. Scrip-holders meetings should be public. The meeting resolved that the qualification for a director should be reduced from 40 scrips to 20. They did not push for voting according to scrip which gives a dangerous amount of power to the man with one scrip.</p>
<p>23 January 1847, page 3</p>
<p>Special Meeting of SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The Chairman Mr Beck listed the topics on the agenda. He noticed a gentleman present connected with the Register and remarked that he thought those present would agree that it was a private meeting. He requested the production of a voting certificate and to his astonishment it was produced. No further objection was raised.\</p>
<p>It was agreed unanimously on a proposal by Mr Graham, seconded by Captain Allen, that the qualifications of directors be reduced to 20 scrip (of £5 each).</p>
<p>Mr Neales moved to do away with the existing voting monopoly which allowed one vote per scrip. He proposed: 1 scrip 1 vote</p>
<p>5 2</p>
<p>10 3</p>
<p>20 4</p>
<p>30 5</p>
<p>40 6</p>
<p>50 7</p>
<p>60 8</p>
<p>80 9</p>
<p>100 10</p>
<p>And for every 25 more 1 vote with scrips to be registered 14 days before voting. Seconded by Mr Stocks. Mr Mildred was opposed. Mr Neales explained that on a previous occasion when the majority of scrip-holders had wished for his election, he had been dumped because every person lumping for himself gave him no chance. Mr Peacock thought the old plan worked well.</p>
<p>Considerable confusion followed and Mr Peacock rose and seemed to justify his conduct. Mr Bruce objected to the Register’s representative taking notes – especially if it were with a view to publication. Mr Neales begged the gentleman to continue taking notes and anyone else also, to expose the rank jobbery of the meeting. A majority of scrip-holders seemed to approve of our reporter’s presence and he claimed the right to be there by virtue of his voting certificate and that right being assented to by the chair, how could they prevent his taking notes.</p>
<p>Mr Neales was particularly keen to ensure the registration of votes 14 days previous to the time appointed to vote and thus to prevent the system of jobbing. Any system worked badly if it put a candidate at the bottom of the poll who had a majority of votes. Mr Peacock said Mr Neales had spoken untruths. Mr Neales said he did not speak of a man’s personal character. He alluded to his capacity for office. A show of hands indicated that the voting should remain unaltered. It was subsequently put to a ballot. The majority in favour of the old system was 480. Mr Neales facetiously remarked: ‘Ay, it’s just as I said one large shareholder can carry anything he likes.’</p>
<p>Mr Graham said no shareholder held 480 scrips.</p>
<p>‘Mr Neales: No, but Governor Graham holds 420.’</p>
<p>There was then a debate about the rules of the Association as related to the number of directors and the replacement of the Resident Director at Burra Burra and whether this meeting could elect a replacement Resident Director.</p>
<p>[There was an argument whether the Resident Director remained a director or whether by becoming a Resident Director, Stocks had reduced the number of directors to eight. And finally after heated and acrimonious discussion a question was put.]</p>
<p>The question of whether Mr Stocks be requested to remain or not [apparently as an ordinary director] was negatived 20 to 7.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal Emigrant Ship</p>
<p>This fine barque arrived yesterday with over 200 free settlers, after a passage of four months, having departed Plymouth 15 November. Most of the migrants are from Devon and Cornwall mining districts. There were seven births and three deaths en route. The ship brings with it news of further sales of Burra Burra ores and we have reason to believe the average price will be found quite equal to £26 per ton.

<p>The high price of Burra Burra shares has been received with great interest in the English mining districts.</p>
<p>We learn that the mineral block adjoining the Burra Burra on the north was taken on account of capitalists in Aberdeen [Scotland] and that this accounts for the naming of the mine the ‘Bon Accord,’ that being the motto of the town of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>Cornish Migrants</p>
<p>We have seen a letter from William Allen, Emigration Agent for SA in Penzance. He says many persons in that area are interested in migrating to SA and among them are many skilled miners. In Cornwall business is dull, the potato crop has failed and distress was being felt and anticipated. There are complaints about a lack of information from those who have migrated, but enough information has come back to stimulate great interest throughout Cornwall. This is not surprising when it has become known that the average price of Kapunda ore per the Templar was over £20 per ton and that Burra Burra ore on the Malcolm brought £21-7-111⁄4 per ton. The Cornishmen are capable of calculating the success of the venture and are also aware of successes on agriculture and horticulture.</p>

<p>Mr Marshall of Currie Street has just completed for the smelting house at the Burra Burra Mine, a blowing apparatus capable of producing a continuous and powerful blast.

<p>Accident/Obituary. Mr Denton, formerly of Kermode street North Adelaide and a shoemaker and carrier to the Burra Burra Mine, met with a fatal accident on Monday evening. He was returning from the Mines with a dray laden with about two tons of ore and was riding on the pole. Near Bryce’s on the Adelaide side of Dry Creek, he appears to have gone to sleep and fallen from the vehicle. The wheel passed over his head, crushing it in a shocking manner. He is survived by a wife and five children. [George Denton died 29 March 1847 aged 45.]</p>

<p>The SA Labour Market</p>
<p>The agents in Britain choosing migrants have of late been selecting carefully and the arrangements made for their voyages have been much improved, if not perfect. The provisions have generally been of good quality and sufficient in quantity. The berths have been conveniently arranged and bedding supplied. Ventilation has been adequate and medical comforts provided. Arrangements for general comfort and cleanliness have resulted in remarkably few deaths on the voyages. More than 650 persons have recently arrived. When a ship is known to be about to arrive those in need of servants or employees strive to be first on board. When the Abberton arrived recently many went down the harbour several miles to meet her, only to find she had anchored outside the Light-vessel, so they went further and boarded her there. Decent female servants are much in demand and liberal wages are being paid. Examples of wages:</p>
<p>Blacksmiths 30/- to 35/- per week</p>
<p>Bricklayers 6/- to 6/6 a day</p>
<p>Carpenters 6/- to 7/- a day</p>
<p>Masons 6/- to 7/- a day</p>
<p>Labourers 15/- to 25/- a week</p>
<p>Shoe &amp; bootmakers 30/- to 45/- per week</p>
<p>Shepherds 10/- to 12/- per week plus rations*</p>
<p>Hutkeepers 6/- to 8/- per week plus rations</p>
<p>Farm labourers 10/- to 14/- per week plus rations</p>
<p>Domestic servants £14 to £18 per year or 5/- to 7/- per week plus board and lodging</p>
<p>Cooks £18 to £25 per year plus board and lodging</p>
<p>Miners 25/- to 30/- a week, but skilled miners are often engaged on tribute</p>
<p>[* The standard rations supplied are 10 lb flour, 10 lb fresh meat, 2 lb sugar and 1⁄4 lb of tea.]</p>
<p>With all this labour arriving it would be nice to see more men with capital amongst them.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>Today we publish the Second Annual Report of the SA Mining Association Directors. It relates principally to the Burra Burra Mines and their eighteen months of operation from 29 September 1845 to 31 March 1847. The statements issued are devoid of any attempt at emblazonment, but a little calculation will convince anyone that those who bought scrip at £100 were either well advised or pretty good judges of what they were about. The production had been running at an average 126 tons per week, but March 1847 averaged nearly 300 tons per week and April looks like being as good. The Directors have indicated their intention to make an early dividend of at least 50% and they are able to do that from the profits on the first 1.757 tons of ore sold. It would seem clear that the 9,841 tons already produced will bring in a profit of £34,502 – more than equal to 280% of the subscribed capital. The Directors assure us that 913 tons lately shipped and the bulk of the stock on hand will be worth upwards of £30 per ton on the British Market. If this is achieved the clear profit will be nothing short of £82,576. This will constitute a profit of £88,736 for sixteen months’ operation, or a rate of £66,552 per annum.</p>
<p>Last April we predicted the probable profits for the first year would be £64,528-4-2.</p>
<p>The importance of this to the colony can be gauged from the expenditure on wages, timber, machinery, horses, tools, implements and stores amounting to £32,943-7-4.</p>
<p>Cartage of ores has cost £21,406-10-3 and other expenses in the colony £5,354-12-9.</p>
<p>In addition there are of course the costs of freights paid to British shipping.</p>

<p>They were: Stocks, Paxton, Addison, Johnson, Ellis, Allen, Brown, Featherstone and Neales.</p>
<p>At this point Mr Smith objected to the voting rules being followed and proposed a new scale.</p>
<p>The Chairman ruled him out of order.</p>
<p>Mr Smith asserted that the present rule was illegal because in law no partner in a concern was entitled to more than one vote without the concurrence of the whole. It was monstrous that any one gentleman should be able to come into the room with an overwhelming number of votes and thus by the accidental power of wealth, arrogate to himself a larger measure of sense than he (Mr Smith).</p>
<p>Cries of ‘Hear, hear’ from Mr Graham.</p>
<p>Mr Smith said he did not speak personally [of Mr Graham] but of the principle.</p>
<p>The Chairman repeated that he would not receive any motion on the subject. They may discuss the voting scale when the Deed of Settlement came before them.</p>
<p>Mr Smith thought that too late, of course.</p>
<p>The results of the voting were:</p>
<p>Paxton 1,764 Featherstone 639</p>
<p>Stocks 1,650 Johnson 488</p>
<p>Brown 1,348 Addison 424</p>
<p>Ellis 1,150 Neales 330</p>
<p>Allen 892</p>
<p>The Deed of Settlement was then produced and Mr Bayne began to read the massive document. Soon after the start Mr Featherstone objected that he for one found it impossible to follow its complexities and objected to not having the leisure to peruse it. Dr Addison and Captain Hall agreed it would take a week of leisure to become conversant with it. Mr Stocks said that even a lawyer could not give an opinion of it from a hasty reading and he would not sign it without reading it. It was agreed to have it printed and a committee was appointed to go over it, to receive objections etc. and to make recommendations to the Directors. The meeting was adjourned to 19 May.</p>

<p>The success here has encouraged the Bon Accord owners (otherwise known as the Sydney Co.’s Mine). Mr Moorhead, Captain Spargo and other employees had arrived at the property and broke fresh ground.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association Meeting</p>
<p>Last Wednesday at 11 o’clock the adjourned meeting resumed at the Auction Mart Tavern in Hindley Street to receive the report of the Directors and of the Committee appointed to examine the Deed of Settlement and then to settle the said Deed. Charles Beck as Chairman of Directors presided.</p>
<p>He said in almost all cases the Directors had adopted amendments proposed by the Committee. He proposed the secretary then read the deed and that every clause not objected to or which was not proposed to be altered by the Committee or the Directors would be considered passed.</p>
<p>Clauses 1-30 were passed with but minor alterations. Then came the controversial Clause 31 – referred to as the Voting Clause.</p>
<p>The Directors were opposed to the scale of voting proposed by the Committee, especially they were opposed to giving the vote to single shareholders and suggested that no shares fewer than three should be entitled to a vote and then holders of a greater number be entitled according to the proposed scale.</p>
<p>Mr M. Smith said if they denied the vote to a single share, then the deed would never be signed.</p>
<p>Mr Peacock said the single scrip holder was much over-rated. He believed they only amounted to ten and their interests could not be considered to the detriment of larger holders. There were many companies where voting was not given to a single share.</p>
<p>Dr Addison said the Sa Mining Assoc. was differently constituted compared with other companies and the increased value of the shares was an additional reason for not denying voting in respect of a single share – even worse if the shares rose, as they might, to £400 or £500.</p>
<p>G.M .Waterhouse supported a vote for the single shareholder.</p>
<p>Mr Stocks was inclined to support the Directors, but as the holder of several proxies that their scale would rule out, he had to vote against their position.</p>
<p>John Brown proposed a compromise, that the Directors’ scale be adopted, but that existing single shareholders retain the right to one vote. This was eventually agreed to.</p>
<p>The scale adopted was:</p>
<p>3-5 inclusive 1 vote</p>
<p>6-10 2</p>
<p>11-15 3</p>
<p>16-20 4</p>
<p>21-25 5</p>
<p>26-30 6</p>
<p>31-35 7</p>
<p>36-40 8</p>
<p>41-45 9</p>
<p>46-50 10</p>
<p>51-60 11</p>
<p>61-70 12</p>
<p>71-80 13</p>
<p>81-90 14</p>
<p>91-100 15</p>
<p>Then 1 vote for every 25 shares beyond 100.</p>
<p>Present holders of 1 &amp; 2 shares will have 1 vote.</p>
<p>It was also decided that no director could hold office for more than three years and that five directors would retire annually. The other clauses were then passed.</p>

<p>Letter to Editor: A Visit to the Burra Burra</p>
<p>I recently was staying in the vicinity of the Burra Burra Mines and took the opportunity to visit the workings. I was not previously aware of the details of the place, so my comments are based solely on what I could learn on my visit. Answers to my questions suggested to me that the miners know little of the mine beyond their own ‘pitches’ – unless, like persons in some other crafts, they derive some self-importance or profit in maintaining mystery.</p>
<p>The great mineral deposit lay at the northwest corner of the Special Survey and is about eight miles from the Princess Royal Mine at the southern end of the same Survey. On leaving [Black] Springs, about 16 miles south of Burra Burra, you cross a range of high hills and proceed up a valley surrounded by ranges of a very bare and bleak appearance, but of a peculiar peaked or conical shape. The workings are within a mile of the township of Cooringa [sic] and all the shafts etc. lie within the space of about 20 acres. When I was there about 3,000 tons of various coloured ores lay on the surface. The blue carbonate and green malachite are, after being ‘jigged’ or sifted over water, very bright and beautiful. Both vary greatly between being as hard as flint or friable. Near the principal shaft was a pile of dark red ore as hard as granite, the product of the Monster Lode. The visitor can see the ore being raised in kibbles by a single horse working a horizontal wheel of large diameter. Between 200 and 300 men are employed.</p>
<p>Great quantities of logs are piled up for timbering the shafts and levels where required. I spent two hours wandering the underground, descending and ascending by means of ladders. The great lode is presently at about 20 fathoms and seemed to be heading off to the northeast. To the westward the levels seemed rather unproductive and this direction was also the most dangerous ground, being more subject to falls. The ground seems more promising to the south and southwest and less hazardous.</p>
<p>The water is operated on at about 25 fathoms and is kept under by a pair of bullocks working two ‘water barrels’ the size of beer hogsheads. No great influx of water is likely at the present levels of operation. Exploration is made by driving levels about 6 ft by 3 ft and following ant lode met with. The entire mine may be visited from either shaft, though it is difficult for a stranger to know which way to turn. Many old workings have been filled up or have fallen in. The main lode is blasted with powder. The men were reputed to be doing well enough.</p>
<p>A number of stores and well-constructed rooms and lofty cottages form the Mining Association township of Cooringa [sic] where one may see the walls of the most spacious hotel yet undertaken in the province and a Wesleyan Chapel is also being built, together with rooms for a day and Sabbath School.</p>
<p>The Bon Accord, or Sydney Co.’s Mine as it is usually called, is being explored, but without much success at present. Indications are said to be good. A large and substantial police station and stables have just been completed for the Government.</p>
<p>Editor. Since this has been received we have reports of the falling in of several shafts, but fortunately with no loss of life. But there is no official news.</p>
<p>South Australian Mining</p>
<p>The editor reviews the state of South Australian mining.</p>
<p>Since the Burra Burra Mine was purchased in 1845 over £80,000 has been paid to the Government for mineral lands, but none except perhaps the SA Co.’s is now paying expenses. While much of it may eventually be profitable, it is debateable whether this sum of money could not have been better invested in other employments, giving speedier and less uncertain returns for the colony and the investors. Mines that pay their expenses from the start are very much the exception and yet purchasers of mineral lands seem to have been assuming it was common. Too large a proportion of the limited colonial capital has been invested in mineral lands. If they were held by English capitalists and a sum equal to that devoted to their acquisition was now devoted to their development we have no reason to believe they would not prove safe and profitable investments. But much damage has been done to individuals who, in the absence of immediate returns, have had to sell at low prices. Others must be content to allow their capital to lie unproductive for an indefinite period. The withdrawal of so large a sum as £80,000 from the available capital in the colony cannot but adversely affect property values and investment in other areas of the economy.</p>

<p>Messrs Weaver and Hart have found an area of grazing land beyond the dense scrub and have skirted the coast with their stock. They have bought land and found copper ore nearby, abutting the coast. 10 or 12 men are believed to be employed at the new mine. Water is a likely problem with only a small lagoon of fresh water and all underground supplies too saline for use.</p>

<p>The ‘Reformer’ Stage-cart Upset</p>
<p>The cart left Harris’s Hotel on Tuesday morning and stopped at the Gilbert for dinner. The river had risen and the mail cart was detained. Reformer then crossed the river safely, but the passengers had remained on the other side. The driver agreed to return and collect the passengers, but he forgot to shift his weight to the windward side and the cart tipped over, breaking the roofing. The horses brought it into about 18 inches of water. The cart was then righted and the driver assured everyone the accident had been entirely due to his omission to shift position, but no passengers were prepared to risk the crossing and the driver continued on alone.</p>
<p>Reformer is also reported to have swum across the Gawler River yesterday unaided, while all others crossed with the aid of ropes.</p>

<p>A Traveller writes:</p>
<p>Can you inform me what remuneration has been received by the discoverer of the Burra Burra Mine? It is currently reported he has received nothing from the ‘Snobs’ and that the ‘Nobs’ gave him only £20 at the time of the discovery. A subscription by the draymen on the road is reported, but it either was not done or it slipped through someone’s fingers before getting into the right hands. Are the Burra Burra proprietors too poor (in spirit) to pay him? All the colony has benefited, so why not make an appeal to the public? He is an old man and in the usual course of events cannot have more than a few years on earth and those should be comfortable, ‘he should not be left to earn his solitary livelihood in a shepherd’s hut.’</p>
<p>A Ruminating Biped writes:</p>
<p>‘Many a poor man like myself will be obliged if you will give him a hint how he may make sure of deriving some benefit from imparting to others the discovery of a valuable lode of copper or other minerals&hellip;But what advantage is there for any person to impart a valuable discovery? If a shepherd who has made such a discovery is urged to reveal it the answer is, “Remember Picket.” If the shepherd’s master makes the discovery he is apt to hold his tongue because he does not want to lose his sheep run.’</p>

<p>Horse Theft. Police Constable Scowcroft arrived in town last Thursday with a prisoner named Bill Wright, on a charge of horse stealing. Wright recently came from NSW with ‘Beardy Rea’ and was engaged by Mr Blake near Princes Royal as a hut keeper, but having a disagreement with the shepherd rode off with a horse, saddle, bridle and tether-rope. The police followed him to North West Bend and Moorunde and thence to Mr Williams’ Station about 30 miles beyond Lake Bonney – a distance of some 260 miles from Burra. This arrest may have a beneficial effect on horse stealing in the district.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mine; The Eighth Wonder of the World.</p>
<p>We have great pleasure in referring to our readers the half-yearly report of the Directors of the SA Mining Association as laid before shareholders last Wednesday in the company’s new offices in Rundle Street. SA readers will not have to be reminded that three dividends have already been paid or that those three have amounted to 200% upon the subscribed capital of the company. A fourth dividend is to be paid on or about 1 December this year. This cannot but be a source of gratification to all in the colony, for all are benefiting by that prosperity.</p>
<p>The quantity of ore raised in the past six months has been more than double that of any other similar period, and also superior in quality. The state of the mine promises long continuing prosperity. The aggregate of deliveries at the Port in the last week of the report was 428 tons. The sales of the last 917 tons reported from Swansea averaged £9-16-3 per ton. There is every reason to expect a higher average as some of the ore has been sold for £32-10-0 per ton.</p>
<p>After repaying the original capital twice over, the clear surplus of property amounts to, at the lowest estimate, £104,694.</p>
<p>[The editor says that this is a gross underestimation of the true value of the assets.]</p>

<p>Court Case</p>
<p>Richard Harris Eade, alias Richard Eade was charged with fraudulently forging and altering money orders drawn by Tristram Bath on the Directors of the Princess Royal Mining Co. on 25 September.</p>
<p>There were four counts:</p>
<p>Forging an order on Mr Thomas Coombes for £6-11-8, with intend to defraud the Directors of the PRMC; the original order being for £0-11-8.</p>
<p>Uttering the said forged order.</p>
<p>Forging the said order with intent to defraud George Morphett, a Director of the PRMC.</p>
<p>Uttering the order with this intent.</p>
<p>Tristram Bath, Superintendent of the Princess Royal Mine, gave evidence of settling with Eade for 11/8 for sharpening tools and the order now read £6-11-8. Eade was working at tut-work and was to have 1/8 per day in overtime for sharpening tools in the absence of the blacksmith. On the same morning he had given him an order of £7-12-6 for the tut-work.</p>
<p>Thomas Coombes, a miner, who could neither read nor write, asked the prisoner to lend him some money to buy a horse and he gave him an order for £6-11-8. Coombes gave the order to Mr Cousins in part payment for a horse costing £17. Gave the prisoner an order for £6-17-2 and the prisoner paid the difference back.</p>
<p>John Cousins confirmed this.</p>
<p>Edward Wright, Secretary of the PRMC said he did not pay the order when it was presented on 1 October because it had been altered. Mr Morphett was one of the directors at the time.</p>
<p>The jury found the accused guilty of forgery and of uttering.</p>
<p>The prisoner was then charged with forging and uttering another order on the same day, 16 September. Originally issued for £5-4-4 to Zacharia Grey, it had been passed for £12-4-4.</p>
<p>The accused was again found guilty.</p>

<p>The SA Mining Association, the SA Company and Champagne</p>
<p>Under the heading Original Correspondence, R.M. Lyon Milne writes in a letter supposedly addressed to the Directors of the SA Mining Association:</p>
<p>Gentlemen – I accidentally visited the Company’s port last Tuesday and my attention was drawn to a gaily decorated ship and shout of conviviality nearby. I was told the SA Company had invited you to a champagne lunch, because of the opening of the northern end of their wharf, professedly for your accommodation.</p>
<p>The hilarity of the moment seemed to be very great.</p>
<p>I cannot say whether the ships were joyed to have arrived after shivering in the southerly winds, or were enjoying the shallows after tossing about on the depths, or were pleased to be huddled together to celebrate the wonders of a maritime monopoly, or whether it was due to the champagne.</p>
<p>Some people, were they to witness the scenes of jollity, would comment on this loving place of ours, where even the arriving ships cannot celebrate without becoming the centre of gossip.</p>
<p>Alas how little do the ships imagine that there are rocks beneath the mud of the port.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let no one blame the worthy manager of the SA Company for endeavouring to promote the interests of the company by every means in his power, nor you, gentlemen, for accepting an invitation on such a joyous occasion when vessels as well as men rejoice.</p>
<p>Neither have I any wish to remind you, that there was a time when you and the company were not on such good terms; time when you, with prompt decision snatched a valuable prize from their grasp and became possessed of what has turned out to be one of the wonders of the world, and a time when they and their advocates abused the Government, and called you gambling speculators. They scoffed at your acquisition on the principal of sour grapes. They were not then your friends and would be your enemies again if it suited their interests.</p>
<p>Now they find such a policy impolitic and invite you to champagne in order to induce you to part with some of the first profits.</p>
<p>Let all this pass. Reminiscences, especially in such a place as SA, are not always agreeable. To see people friendly, who were once at variance is a pleasant sight, even under the shade of Bacchus.</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, you have recently acquired property on the North Arm, on terms which would not have been granted to any others, equal in value to the primary cost of the Burra investment; an acquisition which will one day, should the mine’s wealth be exhausted, return to you all the money you sank in its purchase. Allotments in neighbouring colonies, less favourable situated, have realised £10,000, the sum you paid for your mineral estate, and assuredly the prospective value of your new acquisition at the North Arm.</p>
<p>Now this land was not given to you because you were poor, nor because you required it, nor to make you even richer. It was done to induce you to free yourself and the colony from vassalage; to induce you to free yourself from a grasping and grinding monopoly, disgraceful to the Government and the people who allow it to continue. It was to induce you to make a road to the place, or to get the Government to finance one in order to place the colony in possession of a maritime township by procuring access to the North Arm.</p>
<p>It would be mean and despicable if, after gaining possession, to laugh at the donor and the colony. The man who takes the money of his sovereign and then deserts his service in the hour of battle, is a traitor and dishonest to his country. If you thus desert the cause of your benefactor and the public, after accepting the consideration for your service, you will find the finger of scorn pointed at you and the pages of history will brand you with disgrace.</p>
<p>It is true that you are not legally bound. Your donor, believing you to be gentlemen, refrained from imposing any legal obligations on such a princely gift.</p>
<p>In fact who would have thought of imposing legal obligations to compel you to promote your own interests, unless he reckoned you to be idiots? In accepting the property you have bound yourself by the stronger obligations of honour and patriotism.</p>
<p>But, gentlemen, your own interests alone will render any appeal to you on higher principles unnecessary.</p>
<p>By advancing £1,500 to match the sum placed on the estimates by the Government you will be adding to your own resources annually. The reduction in transport distance for ores of 6 or 7 miles will save £1,500 on every 10,000 tons of ore as well as other economies.</p>
<p>It will also be a benefit to other mines in the colony.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether you will be fools enough to continue to sacrifice this sum annually for the benefit of the SA Company.</p>

<p>Obituary. One evening a miner of some property, who was doing well, but was a heavy drinker, committed suicide one day last week. On the night in question he left his own hut in a state of delirium tremens and sought shelter in the Police Station. The police gave him shelter and watched over him until they thought him all right, and dozed off to sleep. The miserable man watched for his opportunity and got hold of a razor. He cut his throat half through. In the morning the room presented a horrible spectacle, with the corpse enveloped in a mass of gore.</p>
<p>[Strangely, given the circumstances, no death matching these circumstances is recorded on the SA Deaths CD.]</p>

<p>J.B. Graham, the largest proprietor in the Burra Burra Mines, is leaving for England by the overland route to prosecute his continental tour. He leaves today on the Bremen ship Gellert, for Calcutta. It was due to Mr Graham’s efforts, amongst other enterprising colonists, that such a prize as the Burra Burra Mine was procured for resident proprietors. He has reaped a pre-eminently rich reward in proportion to the boldness of his original outlay. In common with a large circle of friends, we wish him health to enjoy the handsome income, which the success of the Burra Mine bids fair to render permanent, or rather an increasing one. We hope in time to welcome him back to the colony.</p>

<p>‘A New-comer’ writes on Runs on Crown Lands</p>
<p>Gentlemen, having lately come here, and being disappointed in my expectations, I am induced to express myself in your paper. Before I left home I was led to believe that good land was available here at £1 per acre. I found that land-jobbers had taken all the best land and were asking £4-£5 per acre. Going north, I found unmeasured field suitable for my needs, but again I was met with disappointment when I was informed that gentlemen occupiers would not allow the sale of small quantities of land to strangers. I observed the names of some half dozen monopolists. I was amazed by the numbers of small stockholders whose stock was dying for want of feed, when hundreds of thousands of acres, with grass rotting or being burnt, might be obtained by application through the proper channels. It cannot be expected that the Governor would be aware of such an astounding fact and having no practical men to ascertain the numbers of stock on these runs accounts for this injustice to the public. Let a man of experience be appointed to survey all runs for stock and let all surplus land be open for selection as runs for stock. I believe that in the district I referred to 150,000 more sheep could be well fed. I hear Mr Dutton holds 200 square miles of land for a yearly rental of £5. This enormous occupancy is defended on the ground that it is no more than the law allows for his stock. This area contains 128,000 acres or 1,600 sections of 80 acres each, which would make so many farms and homesteads for so many families. At an average of five persons per family this would amount to 8,000 souls, instead of 30-40 shepherds and hut-keepers.</p>
<p>How long is this melancholy state of things to continue, by which the industrious and legitimate settler is deprived of his rights?</p>

<p>General Publicans’ Licences [among others]</p>
<p>William Coghill, Gilbert Arms, River Gilbert.</p>
<p>The house was represented as been building for the last three years and was not yet finished. The applicant said he had a short lease of the house, but had laid out £150 in improvements. He had five bedrooms and two sitting rooms, one forty feet long and the other eighteen; altogether accommodations for 30 persons. He had been careful always to keep a good supply of fodder for cattle and horses and had sunk five or six wells for the purpose of obtaining good water. Granted.</p>
<p>Robert Harris, Saddleworth Hotel, Burra Burra Road. Represented to be one of the best houses on the road. Granted.</p>
<p>Daniel Lovelock, Miners’ arms, River Light. Applicant said he had built a seven-stalled stable and a new sitting room. The sitting room was more than twelve feet from the tap. There were two bedrooms and he had made arrangements for building seven more. Granted, but Mr Giles ruled that the house must be improved or the licence would be refused next time.</p>
<p>William Templar, The North Star, Great North Road.</p>
<p>The Chairman said he was sorry that complaints had been made to him by two gentlemen, of great incivility to customers. He hoped he should not hear of such again. Applicant said he was not aware of it. He had tried to make his house as comfortable as possible. Ordered to stand over.</p>
<p>Thomas Tapley Jnr, The Springs on the North Road.</p>
<p>It was represented that the house was in bad condition and not absolutely necessary. Applicant was a young man and had not kept a house before; he was seeking a transfer from Mr Cudmore.</p>
<p>Stood over, with leave to apply next quarter.</p>
<p>Abraham Wren, Burra Burra Hotel, Kooringa. Granted.</p>
<p>Charles James Ware, The Miners’ Arms, Kooringa.</p>
<p>Applicant applied in the room of Henry Chandler who had formerly held the house. Granted.</p>
<p>[Others along the route of the road to Adelaide are listed.]</p>
<p>Tuesday 14 March</p>
<p>Thomas Tapley Jnr. A further attempt was made to get the licence on behalf of bullock drivers who found the place convenient with plenty of water, but the application was again refused, with the principal reason being the bad state of the house.</p>
<p>William Templar’s case was considered. Evidence was tendered as to the incivilities referred to. They had occurred when Templar had refused to give hay to horses of Dr Kent and Mr James Philcox in front of his house. The defence was that with up to 30 people camped around the premises, each with a fire; it was a threat to the premises to spread hay around. He had offered to supply hay or corn in the stable instead. The Bench said this was only one of a number of severe complaints and, as a caution to Mr Templar, they would now refuse renewal of the licence, with leave to apply next quarter.</p>

If detained longer the charge will be 10/- per day for the cart and £1 per day for the coach. This is a great reduction of former prices; the public have to thank the mail contractor for it; who threatened personally to ruin me or anyone else, by running the road for 5/- if we got the mail. But does he know that I have carried scores for nothing and found them in grub on the road. I find more lasting pleasure in doing good than in making money; this was the monster that brought sin into the world, and in too many cases makes knaves or tyrants of its possessors. I wish the mail contractor to know that I am prepared to run the road this winter at the lowest, not the highest prices he may fix; and further, that I consider myself, in no good point, his inferior, except in size.

<p>Carters should note that in addition to the rules at present existing respecting the carting of ore, from 1 May next no person will be permitted to load ore unless provided with tarpaulins sufficiently large to prevent the ore from the wet. Carters will be held responsible for any damage the bags or ore may sustain on the way from Mine to Port.</p>
<p>Persons desirous of entering into the ore carting business or of increasing their present means are informed that as a consequence of the amount of ore now at the Mine, which cannot possibly be carted this season, and the large expected raisings during the winter months, employment will be found in the 1848-49 summer for a considerable number of drays in excess of those engaged this season.</p>

<p>Why Don’t They Smelt?</p>
<p>The question arises after viewing the heaps of ore at Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>What would be the advantages of smelting?</p>
<p>The ore is difficult to export in its crude state.</p>
<p>It would save greatly on freight. (The freight on 5,000 tons at £4-10-0 per ton is £22,500; two thirds of which could be saved. Or if we consider the cost of ore at £10 per ton then £50,000 of capital is locked up while it sits on a wharf waiting to be shipped. The interest at 10% for three months amounts to £1,250.)</p>
<p>The main mine presently working is the Burra Burra, but how much more ore will be locked up like this when Kapunda is fully operational and the crosscuts at Kanmantoo and Tungkillo have struck lode?</p>
<p>The present system limits ores to 20% or better. How much more might be raised if ores of 10 or 12% were viable [due to local smelting]?</p>
<p>Smelting was toyed with earlier, but now the mines are flourishing what has happened to the idea?</p>
<p>[The writer refers to the experiments with smelting at the Burra Burra Mines and thinks a smelting company should be floated. The conclusion is that smelting must come and in more than one site and in more than one of the colonies.]</p>

<p>The third half-yearly meeting of shareholders was held at their office in Rundle Street on 12 April. John Grainger was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the retirement of Mr Shepherd.</p>
<p>The original capital of the company was £14,800. The proceeds and bills drawn against 397 tons of ore sold, shipped, or in course of shipment £3,857-7-0. Fees, £43-10-0 and sundry creditors £183-16-3. For a total of £18,881-13-3. This is accounted for by £13,443-15-2 for land and preliminary expenses; cash etc in hand £534-17-3, working and establishment expenses, and materials £4,903-0-10. Total £18,881-13-3.</p>
<p>The available assets include the balance as above of £534-17-3 and proceeds of intended drafts against shipments or returns expected £1,880. Total £2,414-17-3. The liabilities are only £510-13-6 and a clear balance of £1,904-3-9 may therefore by calculated on for the prosecution of the works, which had been satisfactorily reported of by Captain Bath. , subsequent to Captain Richard’s report dated 18 March 1847.</p>
<p>The directors have met with no satisfactory inducement to lease for pasturage the unoccupied portions of their 10,000 acres, but a proposal to rent a few acres for a market garden had been agreed to. It was intimated that a similar proposal would be favourably entertained.</p>
<p>From Captain Richard’s report it appeared that two pitches upon tribute at Baxter’s Lode had averaged about 12 tons per month for the preceding 6 months at a tribute varying from £3 to £4 per ton. In the same period about 16 tons had been raised from varying parts of the surface at a tribute of £4 per ton. Many Captain would not pay such rates on tribute, but we regard it as proof of captain Richard’s discernment that he has held out to the working miner this inducement to become instrumental in the more extensive discoveries which undoubtedly must, sooner or later, reward the spirited proprietors of this fine property, and enable the Princess Royal Mine to rival its twin-sister the Burra Burra.</p>

<p>In the London Mining Journal of 25 December:</p>
<p>The directors of the Burra Burra Mine have declared a third dividend; the two former were each 50% on the paid up capital, while the third was 100%, thus repaying the shareholders the amount of paid up capital and then giving them a bonus of the same amount. The£5 shares have been difficult to purchase at £120.</p>
<p>What will they say in England when publicity is given to two dividends of 200% each, since paid out by the Burra Burra directors.</p>
<p>Sales of Burra Burra ores as reported from Swansea for 23 December in the Mining Journal of 1 January 1848 amounted to 344 tons for £7,733-5-6. The largest parcel of 280 tons averaged £24-2-3 per ton. The average price obtained for the copper ores of Cornwall in the last quarter of 1847 was £5-10-6 per ton.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. Editorial comment on the 3rd annual report:</p>
<p>‘Within nine months, ended in March last, five dividends have been paid, making six hundred percent. upon the paid up capital, and amounting to seventy-three thousand nine hundred and twenty pounds; and such is the flourishing condition of the Association’s finances, and such their territorial prospects, that the Directors declare their intention to pay two hundred per cent., or, in other words, £24,640, on the first day of every third month; being equivalent to ninety-eight thousand five hundred and sixty pounds per annum.</p>
<p>Success so triumphant, coupled with such a prospect of permanency, is, we believe, without a parallel.’</p>

<p>The Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School celebrated its first Sunday School Festival [Anniversary] on Easter Monday. At 1 p.m. upwards of 140 of the scholars were assembled on the chapel grounds and, headed by Rev. J. Harcourt and local preachers and Leaders of the Society, were led around the town. The Chapel choir attended and at several places on the route they halted and sang several hymns. The procession was also enlivened by other appropriate pieces of vocal and instrumental music. Tea and cakes were served on return to the chapel. Afterwards teachers, parents and friends took tea together in the chapel. A public meeting followed. The secretary reported a Sunday school of 160 students and c. 30 teachers and officers. The funds were flourishing; £30 having been collected since the school was established in December last. A library is being established and £12 worth of books has already been procured. The new schoolroom is nearly completed.</p>

Their homes are made ‘by digging into the bank until a perpendicular of about ten feet is obtained, then cutting in a doorway, one, two, and sometimes three rooms are excavated, having a window, each, the supporting walls being about three feet thick. When whitewashed and tenanted by happy faces the inside of these little vaulted dwellings present a pleasing and comfortable appearance. The chimneys are run up from the back part of the rooms, their mouths wide opening in the upper bank threaten the uninitiated night traveller with too speedy an introduction to the lower regions. Of these a few were flooded out, the earthy parts of those exposed to the beat of the weather beginning to scale off in large pieces gave their owners disagreeable sensations of premature burial, while at the lower part of the creek the miners were compelled to deepen the channel to save their tenements. Right gladly did they welcome the storm’s cessation.’</p>
<p>Disease. There has been a considerable mortality, chiefly amongst children from typhus and scarlet fever. This decrease in population is, however, amply counterbalanced by the mania for marriage here. The advice to do nothing rashly is ignored and many think a fortnight’s courtship is quite long enough and there is happy obedience to the first great command.</p>
<p>The winter brings with it impassable roads and Kooringa people, like the inhabitants of a town besieged, have laid in liberal supplies of flour, sugar etc. in an attempt to avoid the temporary rise in prices and the scarcity of commodities. Many are also waiting for the completion by the Association of a number of cottages (64 I believe) ‘in order to quit their creeky habitations’.</p>
<p>A New Schoolroom</p>
<p>A substantial stone schoolroom, capable of holding from 200-300, and which is intended to be used as a temporary church, begins to relieve the monotonous view of weatherboards and lath and plaster, by a show of its neat little gothic windows. [Given the report on 6 May, this is presumably a reference to the Wesleyan Sunday Schoolroom in Kooringa.]</p>
<p>The Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel was reopened after being temporarily closed for the purpose of being ceiled, floored and plastered. A graceful little pulpit and pew for the choir were also added. A tea meeting was held to mark the event on Monday 12 June. About 170 attended and a public meeting followed. Rev. J. Harcourt gave an address. He made reference to a charge made by some of the misappropriation of an amount received towards the building of the chapel about a year back. He said many of the promised subscriptions of that time had never actually been made, and as to a sum said to have been left in the office, he knew nothing. All he could say was that only £9 had been received at the time referred to. The present improvements had cost £73, which with the original debt of c. £16 had been by voluntary donations etc. and a grant of £25 from the Contingency fund, cleared off to within the amount of £13, during the last three weeks. Three local preachers then gave addresses.</p>

He concludes with a further six lines affirming that from evil good may come, and he will in future be the better in mind and financial gain, from this mishap in life’s journey.</p>

<p>Burra Flimsies</p>
<p>‘A Tradesman’ writes a long and convoluted letter in response to an attack that appeared in the South Australian on 30 May on a friend called ‘Buz’.</p>
<p>[It would seem that a correspondent ‘Lover of Fair Dealing’ wrote on the subject of the use of small value notes drawn on the Mining Co. and tradesmen in place of actual currency in Burra Burra. He seems to have asserted there was danger that the mining company would or could fail to honour its notes. ‘Tradesman’ dismisses this as nonsense given the present prosperity of the venture, the huge stockpile of ore at the mine and at port Adelaide and that the miners have as yet barely ventured below the level of the watertable. Nevertheless a solution to the problem of small orders is not straightforward and the writer appends a few comments before a longer letter on the subject.]</p>
<p>[The letter of ‘A Tradesman’ sets out the problem. SAMA pays its employees in large orders and in the absence of currency they can only be changed by the issuing of small orders by others to be used as small change. To suggest that the Association pay its employees in cash, is to propose a process fraught with difficulties and would be inexpedient. Another problem is that the miners have a habit of keeping their gains in private hoards and so small currency would be likely to disappear from circulation. He considers a branch bank for so small a population in a place, as in all mining areas, with an uncertain future, would be out of the question.</p>
<p>He asks how they got on before the shopkeepers issued small notes. Apparently before Mr Stocks departed he would occasionally supply the shopkeepers with 5/- orders in exchange for large orders. The shopkeeper’s filling in the blank forms to be then signed by Mr Stocks and the Accountant.</p>
<p>He suggests that a solution would be for the Association to pay wages in a mixture of 5/- and 2/6 orders. At present they were paying each set of tributers with a single large order, which then had to be divided among the group by themselves. If this change were made the town would, after a few paydays, be well supplied with small orders that could circulate like cash. Their unsuitability as a remittance would keep them in the district.</p>
<p>The danger to the Association, he suggests, is that the present system could induce the miners to go to other mines as such develop in the colony, rather than stay in Burra where ‘a portion at least of their laboriously earned gains is jeopardized by the existence of an increasingly dangerous currency which they are often compelled to make use of, in order to melt their own good Burras’.]</p>

<p>W.W.G. Nicholls’ Sermon</p>
<p>‘At the outset he was greeted by cheers too vehement to be sincere, and from time to time sundry missiles were hurled from the heretic fingers of certain dastardly dissentients, whilst a gentleman in the boxes, more merry than wise, kept the audience in a convulsion of laughter a great part of the evening by a running fire of burlesque commentary on the Preacher and his subject.’</p>
<p>Nicholls obtained a hearing while denouncing a sort of spurious patriotism that would intoxicate the dregs of society and send them around the town destroying the property of peaceable people.</p>
<p>He had had his windows broken for no better reason than the love of mischief or the recklessness of intoxication. ‘He made a formal apology for certain unfounded attacks which he formerly made against the Roman Catholic Religion.’</p>
<p>He glided into the subjects of the English poor laws and the suppression of the monasteries, but when he ventured into the Irish question the response from the audience became uproar. Eventually he responded to calls to sing a socialist song. [The text of the song is printed.]</p>
<p>Mr Nicholls was most cordially chorused by the whole congregation, which shortly after broke up.</p>

<p>The Burra Flimsies</p>
<p>[Thomas Anslow of Kooringa writes to defend the tradesmen of the town against the suggestion that they may be issuing notes that will not be honoured. And is especially offended that it was suggested that some would set out to victimise the people of Kooringa. Anslow can show receipts for £140 on account of the wooden store that stands near Buzz’s place. Would someone have done this and now be erecting an expensive stone store if they had intended to victimize the citizens of Kooringa?</p>
<p>At the same time he does admit that the present system uses a currency that is ‘flimsy’ and seems ready to endorse the suggestion that the SA Mining Association should issue small notes; which he thinks the superintendents would happily do if instructed by the directors.]</p>
<p>[Thomas Pickett]</p>
<p>The Discoverer of the Burra Burra</p>
<p>‘Philanthropos’ writes from Gawler Town, 30 July 1848.</p>
<p>[He writes concerning the ‘long-promised, patiently-waited-for reward to a deserving individual from the proprietors of the Burra Burra Mine.’]</p>
<p>I was sorry recently to see the discovery of the Burra Burra Mine in straightened circumstances. Especially when the colony owes so much of its present prosperity to that discovery and when it was at its lowest ebb at the time of the discovery. He is earning his bread by laborious means, which his advancing age will soon render him unfit to pursue. He assured me he had not even received the reward he was originally promised.</p>
<p>‘I hope the rich Burra Burra proprietors will not continue to think that the empty reward of bootless fame is sufficient for a man whom Divine Providence made the instrument of reviving the almost extinguished hopes of the colony.</p>
<p>The proprietors can no longer plead that they are waiting to see how the mine will turn out, it has already done wonders, for them, and for us all, so that if they do not presently reward him as he deserves, I hope you will set on foot a subscription for him, without reference to the rich proprietors more especially concerned; I send you my address and shall be happy to give my mite when called upon.’</p>
<p>[The editor of the SA Register then says they will be happy to take charge of any contributions for the benefit of this discover, ‘as we are compelled to despair of any tardy justice being done him’. This was the second or third appeal forwarded to the paper on his behalf.]</p>

<p>Advertisement. Another of W.W.G. Nicholls’ advertisements confirms that the Reformer continues to take people to the Burra Burra Mines for £1 and to Bagot’s Mines for 10/-. He also has two drays, which will travel 25 miles a day to any part of the colony.</p>

<p>Princess Royal £50 shares paid to £37 have a present price of £42.</p>
<p>[A correspondent had evidently posed the question whether the discovery of the Burra Burra Mine had an injurious effect on other mining venture. The paper printed a reply to the suggestion.]</p>
<p>An injurious effect might at first glance seem likely, but in fact less successful operations have been supported by the diffusion of wealth generated by the Burra Burra Mine. The result has been to stimulate enterprise. The writer says he has not visited the mine, but believes the ores is not found in lodes, but rather in what is termed a ‘broil’ in which the ore is interspersed, but not continuously. Whereas lodes generally widen as they descend, a broil terminates suddenly. Sand is a bad sign of such termination and is believed to have been found at Burra Burra. Nevertheless the ore in sight and in certainty will suffice the present generation.</p>

<p>The Burra Creek</p>
<p>A correspondent asks the paper whether the Burra Creek belongs to the SA Mining Association or to the Government.</p>
<p>The paper replies that to all intents and purposes all of it within the Special Survey belongs to the SA Mining Association or the Princess Royal Proprietors. Under the Waste Lands Act the Government reserves the right to make roads, bridges and canals. The Government is hardly going to attempt to construct a navigable canal along the Burra Creek or to construct a road along its sinuosities.</p>

<p>Temperance Meeting at Burra Burra</p>
<p>A meeting was held in the Wesleyan Schoolroom on 29 July to establish a Total Abstinence Society. Rev. J. Harcourt took the chair. He addressed the meeting on the benefits of abstinence. He had experienced the benefit of abstaining from the customary practice in England of taking a glass of wine in the vestry after service, especially on the Monday following. To moderate drinkers he would say ‘all things are lawful, but all things are not expedient’. He approved of moderation in all things except drinking. He read out the rules of the Society and stressed the one calling on them all ‘to suppress any unchristian or uncharitable discussion of the subject. He was supported by speeches from Mr Boots, Mr Roscoe and Mr Sleep. Rev. Harcourt then read the form of pledge and 48 of those present signed up. Not more than 80 attended, of whom about 18 belonged to similar societies elsewhere.</p>

One returned without his steed, which is yet to be repossessed.</p>

<p>‘THE NEGLECTED DISCOVERER OF THE BURRA BURRA</p>
<p>Gentlemen – In addition to the complaint of “Philanthropos,” published in one of your late numbers, I beg to add, that Thomas Picket [sic] petitioned the “Proprietors of the Burra Burra Mine” about three months ago, for some fair donation or a small annuity, in consideration of his discovery of the said mine. To that petition he has not yet received any answer, although it was drawn out in the most earnest and respectful manner possible. It not only represented the benefits that accrued to them from his discovery, but also, his own poverty and incapacity from age, hardships and debility, to support his declining years. Notwithstanding these urgent representations, the fortunate proprietors have not deigned even to acknowledge the receipt of his communication. Such unprecedented neglect of their patron is a crying disgrace to every shareholder of the Burra, and if they persist in paying no attention to the poor old man, I mean to furnish you with a sketch of his losses in consequence of that discovery. The remark of everyone who knows the circumstances, is, “they ought to be ashamed of themselves.”</p>

Country gents should enquire of these men hoe they fare at these houses on the road and not fail to inform the Magistrates of any house that neglects their comfort. If owners were compelled to keep the houses instead of letting them at enormous rents, the needed improvements would be made. At the next licensing day I shall expose to the court four country houses and make specific complaints about others. In this I have no private ends in view, merely wishing to make people deal justly with the weary traveller and no disgust the newcomer with this country on his first journey through it.</p>

<p>Strike at Burra Burra</p>
<p>Late editions of the Adelaide Observer on Saturday 18 September carried the first announcement of a disturbance at the Burra Burra Mines.</p>
<p>Observer Office 9 o’clock</p>
<p>An express messenger left Burra Burra last evening and in little more than eleven hours arrived in Adelaide seeking 20 members of the police force, or as many as can be spared. Three hundred miners who feel aggrieved by the proprietor’s assays are in absolute possession of the mine and will not allow any ore to be removed.</p>
<p>Rebellious miners are coercing the more peaceful by taking them into the bush to prevent their interference. It is also said that so serious a disagreement has arisen between the Directors and Mine Superintendent Mr Burr that no chance of conciliation remains. It is thought Mr Burr will not resign and this unfortunate coincidence adds to the alarming state of affairs there.</p>
<p>Observer Office 12 o’clock</p>
<p>Mr Burra has reached Adelaide. Lieut. Dashwood, Inspector Tolmer and about a score of mounted police are preparing to leave for the mine accompanied by Mr Paxton, one of the directors. It is reported that Mr Lang, the Resident Magistrate and Mr Walters of the Copper Co. have both been maltreated by the rioters.</p>
<p>This news, on a more careful reading of reports, was seen to be false; there being merely an apprehension of violence and the request for police was a wise measure of precaution on the part of the Resident Magistrate.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s South Australian published an account of the events leading to the present situation.</p>
<p>About 10 days ago SAMA decided to dispense with the service of Superintendent Thomas Burra. He was informed in writing. Messrs Beck (Chairman), Ellis and Kingston, members of the Board, proceeded to the mine with Secretary, Henry Ayers, to carry out the resolution of the Board. They arrived on Thursday and on Friday relieved Mr Burr (who refused to resign) of his duties. Mr Burra then left for Adelaide. The miners, upon hearing of the arrival of the Directors, took the opportunity to apply to them for redress of alleged grievances. The Directors refused to meet their deputation and they were told work would be stopped.</p>
<p>This greatly disturbed the tributers as there was several thousand pounds worth of work done by them, for which they would not be paid until the completion of their sets. They then apparently decided to take possession of the mine so that none of the miners could be paid and it would be in the interests of all that a settlement be obtained from the Association.</p>
<p>The system for assays is that when each miner’s ore is cleaned and dressed, it is divided into three parts. A specimen is taken from each part, one for the miner, one for the Superintendent or Captain and one for the Directors in Adelaide. Until recently the assay at the mine was agreed to by both parties. The Directors, having become dissatisfied, had several assays done in Adelaide and concluded that Mr Elphick, a chemist of Rundle Street, was the most correct assayer. He has been appointed assayer to the mines. However, the miners are as dissatisfied with the assays at Adelaide as the Directors were with those at the mine, especially as recently the analyses have recently not been reported in an authenticated form, but only by a letter from the Secretary.</p>
<p>Mr Burra was accused of failing to fulfil instructions to raise only ore of at least 25%. He allowed lower grade ore to be raised and this was paid for at the higher rate. Mr Burra alleges that it is the Captains that are charged with that duty and utterly denies the correctness of the charges against him.</p>
<p>Mr Doran of the Royal Admiral left the mines on Sunday. He reports that men who refused to strike were tied back to back and carried through the town. When the Directors orders the police to arrest the ring-leaders a corporal was stoned and forced to retreat. The miners had made a disturbance at the Burra Burra Hotel and had assaulted one of the Directors or Mr Ayers. About 400 miners are on strike and they say they are determined to have their rights.</p>
<p>Yesterday the South Australian printed a report from their correspondent at the Burra Burra Hotel at 4.30 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>It is reported that on Thursday the miners appointed a committee to meet with the Directors and lay before them complaints about the mode of assaying adopted, through which they feel they are getting less than fair value. They also allege that they have not received payment for much ore now lying on the ground or actually removed. This the Directors deny.</p>
<p>The Directors refused to meet the Committee, but have offered to submit assays to two parties – one to be named by each, to divide any discrepancies not greater than 1% and to refer greater discrepancies to a third party. Upon the men resuming work they are prepared to hear individual complaints. The men have placed in the Directors’ hands a document declaring they will not return to work until the matter is settled and not to allow any ore, upon which they consider they have a lien, to be removed. No answer has yet been received.</p>
<p>The works are at a standstill, but the miners have not interfered with the removal of ore not raised on tribute.</p>
<p>Two men who went to the mine of Friday morning were bound back to back and carried around the mine and town on a barrow, followed by a mob numbering hundreds.</p>
<p>Police Constable Brooks endeavoured to execute a warrant issued by Mr Lang against two of the parties and was struck on the shoulder by a stone. The two men have since surrendered and will appear today before the Magistrate. The water whims have not been stopped.</p>
<p>The Police Magistrate arrived yesterday and in all there are 26 armed policemen from Adelaide and other districts. Everything is quiet at present and, I understand, there is less drunkenness than usual.</p>
<p>Directors Beck, Kingston &amp; Paxton spent a long time last night with Police Commissioner Tolmer and Mr Ayers and, I understand, the bell for work is to be rung at 7 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>The police are prepared to proceed to any extremity and the miners seem equally determined.</p>
<p>[The voice of the Register then resumes. The paper says it is clear the heart of the matter is the palpable discrepancies in the assays and the lack of the usual modes used in the UK to come to settlements. The whole matter having been aggravated by the discourteous line of conduct by the Board of Management as seen in the total disregard of the tributers’ memorial of the 12 August. The paper then prints an article from the aggrieved miners and another from an independent eye-witness.]</p>
<p>‘From the organ of the aggrieved operatives.’ Burra Burra Mines 16 September.</p>
<p>For some time past the miners have felt themselves aggrieved. Wages have been reduced, although the price of scrip has in three years advanced from £5 to £300 and a seventh dividend is about to load the pockets of shareholders, so that there is no ostensible reason for this depreciation of labour. The miners have always quietly submitted to the subtraction of 1/6 a week from their pittance to pay for the Club and Doctor, while the latter regularly makes an extra charge for treating their families. About 700 or more work at the mine, generally healthy and robust and so rarely needing the doctor and each paying 6d for nothing, to the tune of £17-£20 per week or £884-£1040 per annum, besides extra charges for deliveries and family treatment. Surely the position of Mine Doctor is a sinecure.</p>
<p>The returns from the Mine Assay Office have, particularly of late, been very far from satisfactory. This is not the complaint of one man, but a general and increasing malady. Attempts by individuals to have this injustice addressed have been met only with puffs and sneers. At length the pimple grew into a scab and finally burst with a memorial to the Directors on 12 August:</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen – We, the undersigned, your humble petitioners (as the one voice of all the Tributers on your Mine), considering that many of the samples which have lately come up from Adelaide have been undervalued (from what cause we know not), respectfully request that all samples which have been recently, or may in future, be tested or assayed, be sealed with the Burra stamp and then be sent direct from the office at the Mine to a practical assayer with fixed numbers instead of names, and the assayer to remit the ticket, expressing the value of the ore, with his name annexed, to the general Superintendent at the Mine. Also, that there be a re-trial of all samples differing more than one (1) per cent. on the product from our private samples: all differences of (1) one per cent. to be divided.</p>
<p>(Here follow the signatures of all the tributors on the Mine.)’</p>
<p>From the above date to last Thursday 14 September no reply had been received to this petition and the petitioners patiently awaited the arrival of a deputation from the Board of Directors. At length on Wednesday a group of Directors arrived and on Thursday a meeting of miners was held to deliberate on the proper way go to work. A number of miners spoke and the position was expounded. A Committee was appointed to transact their affairs.</p>
<p>As a preliminary step a deputation was to meet the Directors and apply for redress of grievances. It was agreed that in the case of a refusal a general strike of the miners would take place from that moment.</p>
<p>The Committee pleaded and protested in vain.</p>
<p>On Friday another meeting resolved to prevent any straggling dissenter from continuing to work before perfect redress had been obtained. As a result eight were arrested in the act of going to work. Of them six immediately agreed to desist. The other two proved refractory and were hauled up to grass and pinioned down to a hand-barrow. This was then raised to the shoulders of four sturdy men who then carried them in procession around the mine and town followed by the whole body of miners. They were accompanied by vociferous ‘Hurrahs’ and exposed to the ridicule of about 1,800 laughing people. Then the eight were compelled to carry the vehicle of conveyance back to the Mine. All this was accomplished in good humour with no quarrelling or rioting.</p>
<p>The Mines are presently all quiet.</p>
<p>Repeated attempts were made in vain to parley with the Directors.</p>
<p>An anonymous letter from the Miners, drafted on the 15th and delivered on 16 September was verbally rejected because it was anonymous. After that a letter with eight signatures was sent.</p>
<p>The reply was that if all the men return to work the Directors would hearken to the complaints of one or two uncombined men who might come to them.</p>
<p>On Thursday Corporal Brooks was sent with a special warrant to apprehend two men. When he seized one of them a number of fellows said that if he took that man he had to take them also. He said that as he could not take them all, he would take no one. When he reported to the Directors, they said they were perfectly satisfied.</p>
<p>[The other report is from an anonymous ‘Eye-Witness’.]</p>
<p>When I arrived on Friday, I found all the men had struck and that a Deputation of Directors had just arrived. I enquired into the facts, first ascertaining the feelings of the Directors. I found they had the kindest disposition towards the men, with a desire to meet them in all reasonable points. I must say, however, that the workmen are divided into three distinct and separate classes and the business of these classes is carried on by divisions or sets of men of from four to six in each set.</p>
<p>On finding that the whole body had struck, regardless of these classes, I tried to ascertain the true merits of the case from the men themselves. They refused to discuss the matter with me; saying that they would communicate with the Directors only.</p>
<p>The Directors said they were prepared to receive the complaints of any workman individually, or of one representing a set of men in whose contract he was interested, but that as a whole the workmen had not the same interests because they were divided into sets and each had distinct contracts. They could not receive an organised body of whole of the workforce because such could not represent fairly each individual case. Such mobs of workmen were intended to intimidate and the Directors would not submit to that. Besides, the discontents arose from a portion only of the workforce and they had illegally compelled those who were content to leave their work, and out of fear to join the rest.</p>
<p>So the problem is that a general discontent with the assays has arisen and the miners have formed a committee to represent the whole, but the Directors have refused to recognise any such organised body.</p>
<p>From what I have heard, I feel quite sure that the Directors have been actuated by the spirit of liberality and kindness, but they will not allow themselves to be mobbed and overawed.</p>
<p>The requirements of the men may in some measure be right, but the means they are employing to obtain their end are most improper, and no man, however well he may wish them, could possibly back them in their proceedings.</p>
<p>The two men against whom informations were laid have since given themselves up. In general the men have been sober and have shown themselves peaceably inclined since it was known the police were coming.</p>
<p>[The paper then continues to report developments.]</p>
<p>The news from Burra by yesterday’s mail is calculated to remove any grounds for alarm. There has been no serious breach of the peace and no destruction of property, much less any resort to arms or other tragic occurrences. The men have returned to work with assurances that the matters in dispute will be amicably arranged and the Directors have intimated that the carriage of ore has resumed.</p>
<p>The dispute between the Directors and Mr Burra is not likely to be so soon settled. Mr Burra has not only resigned under protest, but has engaged leading counsel, and means to sue the Directors for the full salary to which his services would have entitled him, had he remained Superintendent of the Mines for the stipulated period.</p>
<p>Notice. Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>The Directors hereby notify that they have made arrangements at the Mine for the continuance of the cartage of ores as usual.</p>
<p>Tuesday 19 September 1848.</p>
<p>23 September 1848, page 3</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Strike</p>
<p>We can confirm that the strike is over and that at the usual hour on Wednesday morning all the men were at work. Inspector Tolmer and the police force, which accompanied him to Kooringa left that day for Adelaide. While there Commissioner Dashwood, with the Resident Magistrate, sat in judgement on a miner named William Sprague, charged with addressing threatening language to Captain Roach, and on James Heywood and William Stephens for using threatening language towards Henry Ayers. They were each ordered to pay 30/- for costs and to enter into recognisances themselves in £20 each, and two sureties in £10, for the preservation of the peace.</p>
<p>[The main part of the report again comes from the same ‘Eye-Witness’ as before.]</p>
<p>[The miners’ petition of 12 August is then printed again.]</p>
<p>The miners had complained that no acknowledgement of this had been given or received.</p>
<p>The Directors have issued a Notice concerning this:</p>
<p>‘The Directors having understood, that the answer to the petition of the Tributers, forwarded by them about three weeks since had not been communicated to them, by the late Superintendent, hereby subjoin a copy of the answer of the Board to that Petition:</p>
<p>‘Tributers’ Petition – I have to request you to inform the men, that the difference in their assays is not the result of any undervaluing of ours, but is from the fact of the party, who has hitherto assayed, being in the habit of making them greater than they really are. The Directors wish them to be informed that their wished will be complied with, with these alterations from their proposals, that the re-trial be made only when the samples differ by more than three per cent., three per cent. and under to be divided; that the result of the private sample be given to the Captain before our sample is published; and further the Directors order, that in no instance will they settle upon a certificate of assay from ________ ________ With these alterations, the Directors will willingly pay what is fair in price, if the ores are wanting in produce, more than this the men cannot expect.</p>
<p>Published by order of the Deputation of Directors, (Signed) Henry Ayers, Secretary,</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines September 18th 1848.’</p>
<p>This reply, not having been previously communicated to the men, and they were surprised to find that the Directors themselves had not failed to give attention to the petition, though for some reason it had not been announced to them. Though the neglect was not attributable to them, the Directors would of course be responsible for the negligence of their servants.</p>
<p>The Directors granted an interview on Tuesday to a few individuals and the result was as might have been foreseen. The explanation was from the first all that was required. The Directors never intended to wrong the men and the men wanted only what was right. The consequence was that the men got more than they had asked for, but nothing more than they would have obtained had no strike occurred.</p>
<p>The men seemed satisfied and praised the attitude of the Directors. By means of a note they expressed their regret for what had happened and also asked that their past wages might not be forfeited. (Their contracts make such a fine possible.) At the men’s request the Directors agreed to a return to work on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>During the interview some other matters were raised and dealt with. On the question of the Doctor’s medical fees, they were told to take that up with the Doctor themselves. I am told that this step resulted so far satisfactorily that the men desired to withdraw their complaints on this score.</p>
<p>In the midst of this discussion the Directors gave notice that because of a fall in the copper price and due to the large supply of ore at grass, ‘they had been instructed by the Court [of Directors], when they left Adelaide to say that a reduction in the establishment, both as to numbers and wages, would be necessary at the mines, to meet the state of the markets. They did this so that the men might not be taken by surprise and suppose the strike to be the occasion of it.</p>
<p>The men received this news amicably, merely expressing regret at it.</p>
<p>‘The whole place soon assumed quite a new appearance. The good feelings of the men towards the Court of Directors and their active Secretary, gave vent in a concert in the evening, in front of Wren’s Hotel (where at least 150 of the men were assembled), and at the close loud cheers were given for that “august body.”’</p>
<p>‘If we except the illegality of compelling men to leave off work, I cannot too loudly praise the conduct of the miners in this (unnecessary) strike.’</p>
<p>[He goes on to mention the lack of drinking at the time and the beneficial influence of the town’s ministers of religion.]</p>
<p>[The paper then continues its own commentary.]</p>
<p>The Directors left for Adelaide with a full team of well-fed horses. Unfortunately Mr Chambers lost control of the restive animals when the Police Commissioner, who was sitting next to him, incautiously laid hold of the reins. This occasioned a capsize and all the passengers sustained injuries to varying degrees. No bones were broken, but Mr Beck, the most seriously hurt, was left behind.</p>
<p>23 September 1848, page 4</p>
<p>John James writes from Leigh Street, Adelaide 13 September 1848.</p>
<p>[In a long letter James says he has just retuned from the Burra Burra Mine and has been mightily impressed. In the first half of the piece he gets ridiculously carried away, speculating that if managed properly the mine will be the richest in the world and last for centuries, ‘nay, possibly as long as the sun and the moon shall endure’. The second half is of more interest, as there he makes two suggestions concerning the good management of the mine:]</p>
<p>Would it not be better, he asks, ‘to commence carrying off the whole of the surface under which their ores are, until they get to the mineral deposits; by pursuing this mode they could save all their ores, and also the cast outlay of capital in timber for keeping open the ground below, and also convert the vast quantity of timber at present in the levels into cash.</p>
<p>The proprietors would act judiciously in looking ahead, and cause a given number of men to be employed in making discoveries within the limits of the set whilst the mine is rich, because the outlay would not be felt; and supposing new lodes should be found rich in minerals, the quantity they could raise would be increased, and shares would probably in a short time double, and possibly quadruple their present value.’</p>
<p>27 September 1848, page 3</p>
<p>Adelaide Share Market</p>
<p>The latest Burra Burra sales have been at £205 for cash and £210 is asked this evening.</p>
<p>After conversation with persons with mining experience we are rather surprised that the operations of the company have not been carried on upon the lines suggested by Mr John James in last Saturday’s Register. Not only would the benefits be those he outlines, but we believe there are real dangers that if surface waters should ever find their way down into the mine it could result in disastrous settling with results too horrible to imagine. Given the peculiar nature of the ground we believe this more than possible.</p>
<p>Share prices quoted in the attached list include:</p>
<p>Burra Burra £5 shares at £207-10-0</p>
<p>Princess Royal £50 shares paid to £37 at £42</p>
<p>Copper Smelting in South Australia</p>
<p>Less than a year ago Mr Mauris Thomas, accompanied by two brothers and two sons, arrived in SA. They settled in the Mt Barker district and have, by their own hands, erected a smelting furnace for copper ore in the vicinity of the Kanmantoo Mines. Today the first three tons of merchantable copper have arrived in Adelaide. They have smelted this themselves using only local timbers as fuel. Mr Thomas has concluded an arrangement with the manager of the SA Company to smelt such of their ores not sufficiently rich to ship to England direct and have thus given a stimulus to SA mining industry by demonstrating the ability to convert ores of small yield into profitable material.</p>

<p>[The Patent Copper Co.]</p>
<p>The Richardson has arrived from Swansea with 80 souls, all connected with Messrs Schneider &amp; Co.’s establishment. She left Swansea on 12 June and the arrival affords the colony the means and appliances for converting crude ores of the colony into merchantable metals. Mr Williams, the gentleman so long expected by Mr Walters at Burra Burra Mine, has arrived by this vessel. He will superintend the important smelting operations.</p>
<p>Another Strike at the Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Another strike has occurred at the Mine as a result of the written intimation from the Directors that wages have been reduced from 25/- to 21/- per week.</p>
<p>A very large number of workers at the Mine have signed a letter to the Directors indicating that they have stopped work and that unless the former wages are restored they must ‘leave the mine for some more suitable place’. In the letter of 30 September they point out that before receiving their wages 3/- per week is deducted for house rent, 1/- for the Club and Doctor and for candles at least 3/-. They also point out that the cost of living at this remote place is very high due to cartage, and its location removes any alternatives. In fact they claim to have been going into debt before the reduction in wages, so that an actual increase in wages is a necessity.</p>
<p>[Those listed as signing in the paper report: John Davey Hailes, Malachi Deeble, Charles Read, Richard Trezise, Richard James, William Mitchell, James Hosken, Hugh Bowden, Richard Cocking, William Moyle, James Wallis and Charles Burn.]</p>
<p>Everyone interested in the general welfare must see much cause for regret in the declared necessity of this determination on the part of the workers. But this feeling must be accompanied by an almost positive conviction that ‘the Directors of the South Australian Mining Association are at fault; if only because they have not suffered sufficient time to elapse since the late unfortunate disturbance. A company able to make such magnificent dividends, and possessing such unbounded mineral wealth, ought not to set the example of any sweeping reductions, for which the plea of stern necessity cannot be urged. We foresee and warn the Directors of serious consequences, as likely to ensue to themselves and the colony, from the adoption of a grasping and grinding policy.’</p>

<p>Adelaide Share Market</p>
<p>The news of a strike at the Burra Burra Mine has affected the company’s share price. The suspension of trading in them warrants our term of ‘nominal’ for their price at present. There are sellers at £208 and buyers at £200. Our private correspondent says the report in the Register last Wednesday was fair. And a second received from Mr ________ is not a fair one. He continues:</p>
<p>The public generally know little of the merits of the recent events here, nor of their probable results. Though all is now calm, I do not believe the affair is over. There is reason to believe the Directors have some hidden thoughts on which they will probably act, but they should beware of trying to over-reach the miners. A general strike is not impossible and a sort of Trades Union has been established amongst miners of the several mines.</p>
<p>Princess Royal shares remain unchanged in value at £42.</p>

<p>‘A Shareholder’s Friend’ writes a letter addressed to the Shareholders of the Burra Burra Mine.</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines, 11 October 1848</p>
<p>Are you fully aware of your present position and have you seriously reflected on it?</p>
<p>You know that work here has completely ceased and that must defer your next dividend. Has the present reduction in wages been made on your suggestion and by your consent, or is it simply the partial decision of the Directors? If it is the latter are you satisfied to see your capital idle? If so gentlemen, I would like to arouse you from your lethargy. A great many of the usual expenses are still being incurred and yet not a hammer-blow of work is going on. Furthermore it is likely that surface work will also cease in a week or two. Should the water whims also cease stop and consider the consequences as the water rises. The losses then would run into some thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>The salaries of your officers are continuing with not a penny of income to meet those expenses. Is all this occurring with the consent of the majority of shareholders? If it is not, then a public meeting of shareholders is an imperative. Also, gentlemen be aware that at this very time some of your most practical miners and their families are leaving for New Zealand and other parts. Can we expect our commissioners to keep sending us emigrants when we absolutely deny them even a comfortable living after their arrival and can the editor of this paper continue to offer his advice in favour of immigration?</p>
<p>‘A Teamster’ writes from along the road to Burra Burra 7 October.</p>
<p>The ‘Press’ is solicited by the poor bullock-driver to help his starving team along the road, and through the ‘pinch’. The Burra Directors have sought to diminish the pay of labourers and others at the mines to one guinea [21/-] per week. This is unjust because the pay of labourers in Adelaide is 4/- per day [24/- per week] and at the hay and wheat harvest more. Provisions are about 40% cheaper there than at the Mine. We, the teamsters, sympathise with the demands of the labourers and insist on an increase in the price of cartage and can show you good and rational ground for such an increase.</p>
<p>A good team of eight bullocks, dray &amp; apparatus costs about £100. The team can only be used for about 71⁄2 months; the rest of the year being spell time. In that time ten trips can be made under ideal conditions. The average load will be 21⁄2 tons or 2 tons 121⁄2 cwt which will give for each trip 137/6 or 6/6 a day for this wearisome and exhausting labour. In fact not 20 out of hundreds on the road will make 10 trips a year due to breakages etc. Most will not get a labourer’s wage. Mechanics in town will get 7-8/- a week without the same worries and overheads and will get home to a wife and warm bed and good food. Compare that with the teamster’s lot on the road.</p>
<p>Add to that the fact that the company’s so-called weighbridge at the mine exaggerates the weight of the load by from 8-15 cwt and when he gets to the port the remaster is told his load is say 10 cwt light and forced to bear the cost of the ‘lost’ ore. In those cases when the faulty mine weighbridge causes an error in the other direction the Directors will not pay for the excess carried.</p>
<p>If I have made a good case, let my fellow whips knock off driving until new and equitable arrangements can be made.</p>
<p>A true weighbridge</p>
<p>A deduction on real loss of the carriage price only</p>
<p>For October, November &amp; December £3 per ton for the ore of 20 cwt to the ton, £3-10-0 per ton for the three summer months and £4 per ton for the six winter months and half these prices for the back carriage.</p>
<p>This is a rational and modest advance considering the severity of the labour and the cost of accident and I for one will turn my bullocks into beef or go elsewhere for loads if these demands are not met.</p>
<p>So brother-whips, do not yoke a beast after 1 November until these arrangement have been made. Meet at the Stone Hut.</p>
<p>‘Show, I say, that we have shrewdness to perceive and the will to enforce that which is true and right. Shal the Directors, who by a turn of luck, by a “happy accident,” have been whipped round from “clowns to gentlemen,” shall THEY twist us round their little fingers as they like? Let us show then that we can talk as well – write as well – and, if need be, fight as well for our rights, as any of the “snobs.”’</p>
<p>Advertisement. William Chace of Little Para takes out an advertisement reflecting the demands of teamsters taking copper from Burra Burra to Adelaide.</p>
<p>[He wants £3-5-0 from 1 October to 1 April and £3-15-0 from 1 April to 1 October, with back carriage to be £3 all the year. He too outlines the costs of the teamsters, with stresses on somewhat different costs from ‘Teamster’ above. He says that as the Para Plain is now largely fenced they cannot set their bullocks simply to graze, but must buy hay at 16/- per trip. Their own rations come to £1-4-0 per trip and wear and tear at 18/- per trip. Their wages at £2-5-0 per tip, giving a total of £5-3-0 for 3 tons of copper ore delivered to the port. The present payment is £8-5-0. This gives a balance in the teamster’s favour of only £3-2-0 and that assumes no bullock dies or is lost. Last summer 200-300 bullocks were lost and this can be expected this year as well. More land is being enclosed increasing the cost of feed and the unenclosed feed is of poorer quality and the cattle more apt to stray.]</p>
<p>Burra Burra Police Court, 9 October</p>
<p>George Bull, surgeon, charged Abraham Wren, landlord of the Burra Burra Hotel, with assault.</p>
<p>He asked that Wren be bound over to keep the peace.</p>
<p>Bull said he had been lodged at the hotel for the last three months and last Thursday evening he had entered the travellers’ room with Mr S. Marks and had called for two glasses of liquor. On calling for two more, he had complained that his glass was excessively dirty and requested it be changed. The waiter said it was after hours and no other would be given. Then Wren entered in a violent passion and after much abuse, blew out the candle and said Bull could go to bed. Bull said he would please himself about that and Wren then seized Bull’s chair from under him, continued the abuse, and put him in bodily fear.</p>
<p>S. Marks corroborated the above.</p>
<p>Wren’s rambling statement did not substantially alter the evidence already heard.</p>
<p>To our astonishment Mr Lang, the Resident Magistrate, dismissed the case with a reprimand to Wren and charged the defendant with the costs of the hearing.</p>

<p>[16 lines of doggerel accompany the advertisement.]</p>
<p>The South Australian Mining Association</p>
<p>The recent occurrences at the Burra Burra Mines are well known to our readers and will make the half-yearly meeting of shareholders a more than ordinarily interesting occasion. We would ill perform our duty if we did not again express our unbiased views of the actions of the Directors.</p>
<p>We have no doubt that a dividend will be declared, but will the Directors dare to challenge a vote of confidence or censure?</p>
<p>We fear not, though there is no other way they can escape the odium of their unpopular measures, which have jeopardized the welfare of the colony.</p>
<p>A recent letter from Kooringa says there is a resolute strike of all the underground men and that in a few days the surface men will follow.</p>
<p>If , as a consequence the whems [sic: whims] stop, the water level will rise from the 30 fathom level to the 20 fathom level. The inundation of the intervening levels will sweep away timberwork and materials. Until recently about 20 men were employed in assisting the timber men underground and in repairing supports in shafts and levels. Kingston’s Shaft is described as in a very weak state and Graham’s Shaft passes through troublesome ‘country’ and an extensive and heavy ‘run’ took place near the bottom. These are the two deepest shafts and if they fail it will prevent copper raising from below. It will cost thousands of pounds to effectively substitute other shafts [or repair those].</p>
<p>We do not need further evidence that the scale of wages published by the Directors is very insufficient, but already many of the best men have left for New Zealand and others await only invitations to depart.</p>
<p>One intelligent correspondent writes that:</p>
<p>The miners are fast moving away.</p>
<p>I do not think many would remain even if their requests were granted, so thoroughly disgusted are they with the Directors.</p>
<p>Many are of the opinion that the whole thing is a swindle – a manoeuvre to sell the proprietors and buy the property.</p>
<p>All thought is but for self, and none for the miners, or the storekeepers or others who have built on the property.</p>
<p>Too much cannot be said of the moderation shown by the miners.</p>
<p>Share prices and dividends must fall. There is not 10,000 tons of ore at grass that will pay to be sent home.</p>
<p>Strange revelations will be made when Mr Burr’s action comes on.</p>
<p>Another correspondent writes:</p>
<p>Business continues at a complete standstill.</p>
<p>No work is going on at the mine except the dressing of ore at grass.</p>
<p>In the taking of a pile to dress no competition is allowed; the men have agreed that should the Captain and the men who made the first offer not agree then no one will take that work at a lower rate.</p>
<p>About 400 of the miners have formed a club, each member paying 1/- weekly towards a fund to support poorer families while the strike lasts.</p>
<p>No assistance has yet been required.</p>
<p>They consider themselves prepared to hold out for about six months.</p>
<p>The Directors may fortify themselves in their resolve, but it is morally impossible they can exonerate themselves from the devastating mischief, which is likely to follow from their recklessness.</p>
<p>The interruption to the carriage operations is another aspect of the dilemma. We hear that the drayman’s actions are likely to produce a serious loss to the Association due to heavy demurrages to which the detained shipping will be entitled under their charter-parties.</p>
<p>These successive strikes have arisen from dogged mismanagement. ‘If it is possible that there is anything approaching chicanery in all this; we hope it will be unsparingly exposed and denounced.’</p>
<p>18 October 1848, page 3</p>
<p>Adelaide Share Market</p>
<p>There has been a further decline in the price of Burra Burra Shares. The last sale reported this afternoon was at £190 cash for two shares.</p>
<p>The price of the shares this evening is £50 per share below that of two months ago. The company, it is said, has as much ore on the ground as would pay two years’ dividends. But the state of the European markets makes it questionable whether it is wise to raise ore in increasing quantities.</p>
<p>21 October 1848, page 3</p>
<p>Freedom of the Press</p>
<p>In what we conceive to be an English privilege we have commented with some freedom on the measures of the SA Mining Association, which in our opinion, and those of many shareholders, was likely to adversely affect not only the Association, but also the colony.</p>
<p>We have also thought it our duty to print a small proportion of the complaints of many correspondents among the workings classes employed by the Association.</p>
<p>It is well know that while we never shrink from exposing alleged misdoings of a public nature, we also are ready and happy to publish any explanatory statements in correction of any inaccuracies made by ourselves or our correspondents.</p>
<p>If there had been anything erroneous in anything that has appeared in our columns, the Directors of the Association knew very well that our columns were open for them to convey to the public their own version of the matter.</p>
<p>We had expected that gentlemen filling the honourable and responsible positions of Directors of so important and influential an Association would have maintained a dignified reserve and let their well established reputations and the results of their proceedings speak for themselves. But it appears that these persons do not so judge. We have instead received the following letter:</p>
<p>South Australian Mining Association</p>
<p>Adelaide, 17th October, 1948.</p>
<p>Sir, - I am requested by the Directors of this Association, to request that you will discontinue advertising in the South Australian Register newspaper, any notice &amp; c., having reference to this Company.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,</p>
<p>Your obedient servant,</p>
<p>HENRY AYERS</p>
<p>Secretary.</p>
<p>Mr John Stephens.</p>
<p>We confess ourselves unable to account for this undignified and somewhat puerile act of retaliation.</p>
<p>We can hardly think these gentlemen believe that this withdrawal would alarm us into abandoning our duty to the public at large. Do the Directors think that repressing adverse opinion would promote the interests of the Association? Is this personal pique, or were the shareholders at their last meeting called upon to support this action?</p>
<p>We will not barter away the right to the free expression of our honest convictions, as public journalists.</p>
<p>But this is not the only pecuniary penalty to which we are to be subjected. Noting less than our utter ruin will satisfy them.</p>
<p>To the inadvertent publication of an objectionable phrase in the letter of a correspondent, though we know not why they should suppose for a moment that it was intended to apply to them, we have offered an ample apology elsewhere. Without any demand for an apology or explanation, and even after an apology has been known to have been offered, nine actions have been commenced against us, one at the suit of each Director.</p>

<p>Adelaide Share Market</p>
<p>On Saturday the price of Burra Burra shares was £120, but the price has been so uncertain this week that tomorrow at noon two lots of five and six shares each will be auctioned, evidently to ascertain their full value for parties interested in ascertaining that.</p>
<p>There are prophecies that they will fetch £100 and even parties who predict a price of £50. As we know a number of parties quite willing to buy at £100, we do not apprehend a drop to such an absurd price. Even if the dividends were reduced to one half, the yield at a price of £160 would be 121⁄2%.</p>
<p>About 40 Burra shares have changes hands at £110 since our last and today the price asked is £130.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Carriers’ Intended Strike</p>
<p>Correspondence from ‘Teamster’</p>
<p>People are disputing my assertion that supplies in Burra Burra are 40% dearer that in Adelaide. Meat and butter are the same price, but overall the cost of living is 40% higher. Everything else has to be transported 100 miles overland. Most consumable articles are highly damageable and perishable from the summer’s heat and the winter’s rains, and these losses further increase costs.</p>
<p>[The writer than writes 3 paragraphs ridiculing the nine charges brought against the Register editor by the nine Directors and ends by suggesting that 500 teamsters would come to his aid to defend their defender.]</p>
<p>The last news he had was that the Directors had decided not to grant the teamsters their demands. The teamsters are determined to persevere because:</p>
<p>The Directors cannot help themselves as their ships are already on demurrage.</p>
<p>They cannot do without the ore being brought down, because their account is overdrawn some £40,000 or £50,000 – as one of their wise men said in confidence to a hundred persons.</p>
<p>Was this said to depress the share price to £100 so that the wise man might buy back at that what he had sold at £200?</p>
<p>[The writer goes on at some length to suggest the difficulties that will ensue for the Association if they do not pay the teamsters more. He wonders where they will get the funds for the next dividend and refers obliquely to a report from England that antimony had been found in some ore, which would diminish its value.]</p>
<p>The editor then confirms the antimony report and also reveals that a recent fire in a cargo if copper ore from Cuba and the loss of a vessel from this colony had caused the underwriters at Lloyd’s to increase insurance rates from 5% to 6%.</p>

<p>Supreme Court of SA, 2 November.</p>
<p>Case of Burr v. Beck [and the other Directors of the SA Mining Association]</p>
<p>Fisher appeared for Burra and Gwynne for the Directors.</p>
<p>Having had his contract terminated early, Burra was claiming £3,000 in compensation.</p>
<p>Fisher began by outlining the circumstances of Burr’s appointment as Superintendent of the Mine and those of his dismissal. Burra had been Deputy Surveyor-General in SA when approached by Ayers on behalf of the Directors to relinquish that position and take on the post of Superintendent of the Mine for a minimum term of three years at £700 p.a. If the term were not extended he would be entitled to £200 to cover the cost of returning to England, if he chose to do so within six months. A letter of 31 August 1848 lists these arrangements as well as the company’s undertaking to have a suitable house erected and to pay for water and a fuel supply. Free travel within the colony on necessary company business was also offered.</p>
<p>Burr’s acceptance, which also repeated the above conditions, was also presented.</p>
<p>Burra arrived at the Mine 10 September 1847 and improvements in the operation followed. He was appointed a JP. The Directors visited from time to time, but Mr Burra claimed no knowledge of the real cause of his abrupt dismissal. The letter of dismissal was presented.</p>
<p>This letter accuses him of ‘want of attention in the cleaning and dressing of ores’. It was on this that the Directors visited the mine. The Directors complain that assays proved Burr had accepted ore and paid for it ‘at below the produce at which his instructions authorised him to receive it.’</p>
<p>This they said was the consequence of his careless assaying. They had reason to fear that a similar discovery of the real value of ores already shipped would entail serious losses to the company and inconvenience. The letter of dismissal said the Directors would visit the Mine on 14 September 1848 to accept his resignation or otherwise to carry out the decision of the Board.</p>
<p>On 13 September Messrs Beck, Kingston, Ellis and the Secretary arrived. They refused to receive Burr or to explain the letter. On the 14 September Mr Beck gave Burr one hour to resign or they would carry out the decision of the Board. Burr refused to resign.</p>
<p>On 16 September Burra wrote to the Board demanding payment of £1,750 in breach of his contract.</p>
<p>This sum represented:</p>
<p>Two years’ salary 1,400</p>
<p>Two years’ house rental 100</p>
<p>Two years’ water and fuel 50</p>
<p>Passage to England 200</p>
<p>On 27 September Burra received notice that the SA Mining Association had paid £26-17-0 into his bank account as being the full balance due to him. Burra declined to accept this as settlement.</p>
<p>Fisher believed he had established a breach of contract and it was not his job to prove the validity of the cause of the dismissal; that was up to the defendants.</p>
<p>He claimed of the jury £1,750 less the £26-17-0 already transferred, plus such damages as the jury may determine.</p>
<p>Henry Ayers gave evidence of knowing the defendants and of acting as their agent in writing letters etc. He outlined events leading to Mr Burr’s appointment. Mr Stocks Jnr had been Resident Director from February 1846 (appointed in December 1845) to February 1847. Mr Chipman had been appointed Superintendent in January 1847 and it was his letter of resignation that had led to the approaches to Mr Burr in August.</p>
<p>Ayers said he had signed the letter of 31 august on behalf of the Directors named in the margin – their names had been inserted there at Burr’s request so he would know with whom he was dealing: Cass, Beck, J.B. Graham, W. Peacock, J. Waterhouse, W. Paxton, S. Stocks Jnr, J. Brown, J. Ellis and W. Allen.</p>
<p>Gwynne argued for a non-suit, largely on legal technicalities. When this failed, he then addressed the issue of the causes for the dismissal; alleging Burr’s failure to carry out his duties in the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>One of Mr Burr’s duties was to assay ores, and another duty was not to purchase ores under 20% copper, or of an average less than 25% (in the event of lower grade and higher grade ores being mixed in a parcel of ore). He should see that the ores were properly dressed. He had also to keep a diary of events at the Mine. (Burr contended that the extensive correspondence with Ayers met this requirement.) He also had to oversee the erection of cottages.</p>
<p>Burr had asked for the appointment of an assistant, Hoskins, to do the actual assaying. The Directors had grown dissatisfied with Hoskins and decided he could not be recognised as an assayer for the Mine.</p>
<p>On 12 June 1848 samples of ore were sent to Adelaide for assaying and the Directors became convinced that something was very rotten in the management. On a visit to the Mine the Directors had found six heaps of ore totalling 6,550 tons. Six samples were taken and half of each was given to Mr Burra to assay and half sent to Adelaide. This ore had already been bought on the basis of 381⁄8% copper.</p>
<p>Burr’s own assay returned 311/6%. This meant the plaintiff had overpaid wages.</p>
<p>On the lower floor there was a heap of ore paid for and ready for shipment. It was found that of this, heaps of upwards of 500 tons were less than 20% copper. If sent to England the company would have drawn against it on the assumption it was at least 25% and so have tarnished the company’s reputation.</p>
<p>The cottages Burra was supposed to be supervising were also very defective. Some were built without foundations, while others had leaky walls and walls that were not perpendicular.</p>
<p>Ayers gave evidence of telling Burr his duties on 14 September 1847 at Burra; Burr having arrived there on 10 September. Copies of the rules were given him on 15 September when Ayers was leaving with the Directors.</p>
<p>When Ayers visited the Mine in August 1849 the cottages were no better, despite Burr’s complaints to the contractor (Taylor). Burr had also failed to communicate the Directors reply to complaints from the miners, which had led to the 1848 strike.</p>
<p>Case adjourned.</p>
<p>Case resumed 3 November.</p>
<p>Fisher cross-examined Ayers.</p>
<p>Burra Mine first ground was broken on 29 September 1845.</p>
<p>The Directors were then: Beck, Graham, Peacock, Neales, Solomon, Stocks Jnr, Penny, Paxton and Bunce.</p>
<p>The Superintendent’s duties were to oversee and give direction to all underground excavations and surface work, including cleaning and dressing of the ore.</p>
<p>First Captain was Henry Roach, appointed January 1847.</p>
<p>Second Captain Bryant</p>
<p>Third Captain Goldsworthy</p>
<p>Fourth Captain Penglaze [print here is faulty, but the name when he gives evidence is Samuel Penglaze.]</p>
<p>Penglaze is the surface [or elsewhere the grass] captain. His duty was to attend to ore dressing.</p>
<p>Written instructions dated 8 September 1847 were given to Burr on 15 September 1847.</p>
<p>Burr sent about 102 letters to the Secretary/Directors during his term, together with some thousands of documents, including the Superintendent’s Report. Ayers swore that this latter was not in the form of a journal. He could not say whether everything of importance was enumerated. Witness assented to a long list of returns as being Burr’s duties. After Burr had left, they had found no copies of the correspondence. An incomplete diary had been found. At first letters were transmitted weekly, but later as postal arrangements changed, they were sent twice weekly.</p>
<p>Questioning then turned to the cottages.</p>
<p>Ayers said he had not seen the cottages from 10 August until after Burr’s dismissal. (A contract was presented for the erection of the 40 cottages, the subject of complaint. It was in Burr’s handwriting and dated 5 April 1848.)</p>
<p>The cottages were to cost £45 each. Some were unfinished when Burr was dismissed and had been continued by the same contractor, who had been paid about £200. Some stone cottages had been built before that of 3-4 rooms each, at a cost of c. £150 each. They had been erected under the supervision of a distinguished architect. [Kingston]</p>
<p>The smelting house in stone and brick had cost £1,500.</p>
<p>Ayers admitted that these cottages ‘were all cracks’ as was the smelting house, though ‘not more cracks than in other buildings in town’.</p>
<p>Fisher was queried as to relevance and said he intended to show these cracked buildings were erected under the supervision of one of the complaining parties.</p>
<p>Ayers said the census had show there were c. 1,500 living at the Mine – a number of them ‘in holes excavated’.</p>
<p>Fisher said on 7 September Ayers had written to Burr and said in part:</p>
<p>‘It was satisfactory to know that Mr Elphick’s analysis corresponded with your own, and that Dr Bruhn cannot be relied on.’ The letter of Burr’s dismissal was dated 8 September!</p>
<p>[Evidence was then given relating to ores raised before Burr’s arrival.]</p>
<p>Ayers went on to give evidence concerning assays and said that when the Directors decided that samples should be sent to Adelaide for assay, because they had no confidence in Mr Hoskins or Mr Burr, they had not communicated that fact to Mr Burr. Mr Kingston had pointed out the defects in the cottages and suggested possible improvements. The suggestions were complied with. Among suggestions, walls were to be made 18 inches higher and doorways 6 inches higher.</p>
<p>[There was a long cross-examination of the correspondence between Burr and Ayers in which Fisher sought to show that Burr had taken action regarding the cottages and to increase the efficiency of the Mine.]</p>
<p>The sitting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Samuel Penglaze, Grass Captain gave evidence that the assay office adjoined the general office. He never saw Mt Burr assay any ore. He saw Mr Hoskins assaying every day.</p>
<p>Mr Gwynne submitted that devolving the duty to his drudge was neglecting it.</p>
<p>Witness Penglaze never saw assaying done after Hoskins left. Mr Burra was present in the works.</p>
<p>[Further evidence was given concerning operations and Burr’s presence at them.]</p>
<p>W.H. Challoner, Mine accountant, explained the recording of the ore raised etc. He recognised the plaintiff’s diary when handed it. He had seen Mr Burra assaying a few weeks before he left the mine – though not earlier.</p>
<p>He knew some cottages were built by Taylor and were in some measure without foundations. Floors were beneath the outer surface.</p>
<p>Henry Roach, Mine Captain, said he took the samples for assay. He had seen Burr assay by wet process, but not by fire, shortly before he left.</p>
<p>He recalled the Directors’ visit in June, when Hoskins was dismissed and heard Burr say he would back him (Hoskins) against any man in the colony for assaying.</p>
<p>[Further evidence was given relating to the 6,550 tons of ore on the dressing floor and of other details of operations at the mine.]</p>
<p>J.E. Phillips, clerk at the SA Mining Association Office gave some evidence.</p>
<p>James Trewartha, Government Mineral Surveyor, gave evidence of how ore samples were taken.</p>
<p>Edward Davy, Surgeon, gave further evidence of assaying and sampling.</p>
<p>Andrew Robins, miner at Burra Burra, gave evidence of hearing of the new rules on how assays would be conducted and used. He also lived in one of Taylor’s cottages, paid 3/- a week for it and had no cause for complaints regarding it.</p>
<p>John Hailes, miner at the Bon Accord, had worked at the Burra Burra Mine for two years and gave evidence on sampling processes.</p>
<p>Richard James, miner, living in the Creek at Burra Burra, gave further evidence on sampling techniques.</p>
<p>The case was then adjourned.</p>
<p>8 November 1848, page 2</p>
<p>The Defeat of the Burra Burra Directors</p>
<p>The news of the verdict in the Burr v. The Board of Directors’ case was immediately despatched to Burra. The verdict not only relieves Mr Burr morally and financially, but also manifests an honest boldness in the gentlemen of the jury. It is a signal of a righteous judgement for what appears to have been an attempt by the Board of Directors to get rid of an officer they had engaged for three years at what they afterwards came to regard as an expensive salary. Their attempt was discreditable on the grounds of the concealment of their ulterior motive and this is clear from the letter of 7 September, written only twenty-four hours before the letter of dismissal. The content of the 7 September letter completely negatived the allegations of his negligence or alleged inability to conduct assays. The procedures on the following day were perfectly outrageous. The secretary’s letter of 7 September reveals that the first reaction to news from England of a decrease in copper prices was a resolve to reduce wages throughout the mine, though this was concealed or denied.</p>
<p>The miners are determined to continue the strike and the position on the property is serious.</p>
<p>The Directors may hold out against the men, but will not find it so easy to satisfy clamorous shareholders on Boxing Day.</p>
<p>8 November 1848, page 3</p>
<p>Supreme Court of SA, 4 November</p>
<p>Cross-examination of Ayers continued.</p>
<p>Witness said the instructions given Burr when appointed were approved by the deputation of Directors at the Mine at the time.</p>
<p>William Pope, a miner for 15 months at Burra Burra knew Hoskins to have done the assays at the Mine from April to June 1848. He also gave evidence concerning the changed instructions about resolving discrepancies in assay results before payment. On a re-run of some of his ore the results were 1⁄8% under Hoskins’ first assay, but 11⁄2% over the Directors’ first assay. He said the strike began before the Directors’ response was publicly known. Captain Roach had communicated it to a few, but Pope had not known it.</p>
<p>James Hoskins the elder, miner and assayer, said he lived in one of Taylor’s cottages. All the completed cottages were let and he found them tenantable and secure.</p>
<p>James Taylor, carpenter of Kooringa, had been engaged to erect 30 cottages. He had erected some and parts of others. The walls were 6 ft 6 inches from the floor. The foundations of brick cottages were of stone 22 inches high. The walls of other cottages were all of stone. The brick walls were 9 inches thick and the floors were raised above the outside surface. Foundations in some places were sunk. Stone walls were 14 inches thick and the height of the first lot was 6 ft 6 inches and some later ones were 8 ft. When Mr Burr left there were 16 brick cottages and 14 stone ones completed. The company owed the witness c. £300 for work and material then on the ground when Burra left. He had finished some houses and been paid £250 since. All cottages finished when Burr left were presently occupied. None of the 8 cottages facing the creek were finished. He believed his cottages would last for 100 years and that observers then would say the same. The floor was to be lime-ash 2-3 inches deep. Mr Burr had said the last cottage finished was better than the rooms he had. Possession of 26 cottages had been given to Mr Burr. The cottages which he got notice to take down were not finished when the witness left Kooringa.</p>
<p>Gwynne summed up for the defence. He said much of the evidence was intended to show the difficulty in obtaining a sample from the large heaps of ore by the Kooringa method, but they had all made the mistake of attributing the difficulties to the size of the mass and not to the character of its component parts. The evidence showed the plaintiff had not kept his side of the contract and that his dismissal was justified.</p>
<p>Fisher summed up for the plaintiff. Gwynne had poured scorn on the plaintiff’s witnesses, but Gwynne’s own witnesses were much more interested parties than any of those the plaintiff had relied upon. He said Mr Burr had not been shown to have made any representation to induce the offer of the position and had left a highly honourable office to take up the position at the Mine. He had left a position with the certainty of advancement.</p>
<p>The assaying was incompatible with the many onerous duties the Superintendent had to perform. Mr Ayers had admitted that letters from him might be made to appear official or otherwise to suit a given purpose. There was nothing in Burr’s instructions concerning the cottages and all the alleged general neglect was mere trumpery.</p>
<p>The letter of dismissal depended on the cleaning of the ore, the subject of assaying and the fear of loss on previous shipments. There was no proof that copies of correspondence were not kept. Keeping of a formal diary must have been a matter within the discretion of the Superintendent. Any attempt to link Burr with the miners’ strike was spurious. In Ridgway v. The Hungerford Market Co. it was held that if a master had retained a servant in his employ after having taken cognizance of a fault, a condonation would be presumed and he (Fisher) contended that Ayers’ letter of 7 September was a full condonation of all former matters complained of.</p>
<p>[The letter is then printed.]</p>
<p>And yet the letter of dismissal was sent the very next day.</p>
<p>His Honour then summed up.</p>
<p>Mr Burr sought to recover damages for being unduly dismissed; he had been engaged for three years on conditions repeatedly detailed during the trial and his discharge without just cause after one year was the cause for the action. The defendants denied the contract and in addition alleged various breaches of duty of which the jury had learnt from counsel and witnesses in justification of the dismissal. He would dispose of the first plea that they did not enter into the contract and that Mr Kingston was not a Director when the contract was made.</p>
<p>His Honour read the letter of appointment and Mr Burr’s reply and called attention to Mr Ayers’ evidence concerning the letter and the Directors’ names. The jury would have to decide the meaning of the document.</p>
<p>If they thought Mr Burr required or believed he had the security of the Company as well as the Directors, they would find for the plaintiff and if not, for the defendants.</p>
<p>He would have them consider whether the plaintiff was to make assays of the men’s samples as well as of the newly discovered ores. It was clear assays were to be made, but not so clear by whom. His Honour read to the jury Mr Ayers’ evidence on Burr’s duties, to perform the duties of Mr Chipman, and also Mr Burr’s letter stating his intention to engage Hoskins to do the drudgery. The jury would have to decide whether Mr Burr considered it his duty to do the assaying. His Honour scrutinised Mr Phillips’ calculations and deduced that the loss showing was so small that it did not bear out the charge of wilful negligence – still that was up to the jury to decide.</p>
<p>When it came to the charge of wrongfully and carelessly paying for ore below the recognised standard of 20%; was this charge made out to the jury’s satisfaction? The lot of ore referred to came out at 193⁄4%. Did this justify the plaintiff’s discharge?</p>
<p>Then came the charge of grossly negligent supervision of ore-dressing. It appeared that a quantity of the ore was ordered to be redressed. It was for the jury to decide if that redressing was necessary and if that necessity arose through negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
<p>They would also have to consider the evidence about the state of the sieves and a letter was read to them from Mr Burr requiring a supply of wire. It appeared to His Honour that this was the strongest charge against Mr Burra, but the jury had to decide if it justified his discharge.</p>
<p>As for the cottages – the point here was not whether the contract was improperly drawn, but that Mr Burr had permitted work to be continued after it was condemned and had paid money on it.</p>
<p>[There was further summing up on details of the cottages and on whether Burr had kept copies of his letters and had failed to keep a diary.]</p>
<p>On the charge of general neglect His Honour said that neglect should be specified.</p>
<p>The question of damages he would leave to them. Mr Burr was claiming two years’ salary, an allowance for house rent, for firewood and for water. As for the passage money to England, neither side had addressed that throughout the trial.</p>
<p>The jury retired at 4.30 p.m. and at 4.50 p.m. returned with a verdict for the plaintiff with damages of £1,523-3-0.</p>
<p>Mr Giles, the foreman added:</p>
<p>‘The jury desire to record their conviction that nothing has transpired in the slightest degree to impeach the character for integrity previously enjoyed by Mr Burra.’</p>
<p>Simultaneous applause broke out in all parts of the court.</p>

<p>Advertisement. As many people believe that the object of the proceedings against the proprietor of the Register is to suppress fair and open discussion, it has been decided that a public meeting will be held at the Theatre on Tuesday 28 November at 7 p.m. Parties who desire to support Mr John Stephens in his fearless endeavour to uphold the freedom of the press in this colony are asked to attend.</p>
<p>Editorial: The Rights of Labour</p>
<p>When Mr Wakefield propounded his threefold theory of colonization: the union of land capital and labour, he could not have imagined that within twelve years the public journalist would have reason to pause before repeating an invitation to his unemployed fellow subjects in his fatherland. But, so it is.</p>
<p>A certain class of employers, who have benefited from fortuitous prosperity are now availing themselves of their unlimited power and influence to presume upon the preponderance of supply in the labour market to dictate terms to those who have taken themselves to a distant part of the colony on the promise of liberal treatment.</p>
<p>No sooner was the determination of the Burra Directors made known last October, than the miners determined to resist the attempted reduction. At this moment several hundred of them have made it a point not to bow down to the golden calves, but to remain unemployed, or to seek for other sources of employment. And they are right. If they bow down to this reduction, which was decided upon when the employers were making dividends of 200% per quarter, what could they expect except further reductions until they were brought down to the level of drudgery and starvation from which they hoped they had escaped when they reached our shores?</p>
<p>[The article then recounts the example of a refugee from France who was offered £15 per annum and rations by a sheep-farmer, for the services of himself, his wife and a sturdy son.]</p>
<p>Letter from the Burra Burra Mines, 11 November</p>
<p>Today had been appointed the General Survey Day, for the purpose of setting various tut-work bargains and tribute pitches. Against the smith’s shop door were several notice papers. They announced 7 tut-work bargains and 21 tribute pitches. It has been the custom to offer70 to 80 of these places and by this reduction fully 300 men are thrown out of employment in the underground department. With very few exceptions all the miners then gathered on the side of the hill and in perfect composure and quietness entered into a discussion. This resulted in a resolution for a deputation of the miners to wait upon the visiting Directors to obtain from them the information (as the notice had said nothing about the rate of wages). The reply was: ‘If the men have a mind to work, they must work for 30s a week.’</p>
<p>The men said that at that rate it was not possible for the men to maintain their families in honesty and uprightness. The Directors said they would give no more and the deputation returned with this news to the men. The 400 assembled said with one voice, ‘We cannot, and therefore we will not work for that rate of wages.’</p>
<p>They then went home and no survey was held.</p>
<p>It would be a great pity if newcomers were inveigled by the company into accepting work here.</p>
<p>How can the men maintain their families at the offered rate of 30/- per week, when the old hands themselves, after a lengthy struggle have not been able to manage it? 30/- at Burra is barely equal to 20/- in Adelaide.</p>
<p>They must be madmen that can expect or try to exact it.</p>
<p>A notice was then posted:</p>
<p>‘Notice is hereby given, that all those who are not in the employ of the Association, are required to give up possession of the cottages!’</p>
<p>‘Can they imagine for a moment, that after depriving us of the possible power to feed our hungry families, we shall quietly submit also to be kicked out of doors?’</p>
<p>‘This is indeed the apex of arbitrary oppression – the ne plus ultra of despairing, malicious folly.’</p>
<p>Who can read this without regretting the absence of a spirit of conciliation, which is the essence of Christianity and has hitherto distinguished every man deserving the name of a freeborn Englishman?</p>
<p>Well, the deal is done. Four hundred miners are at this moment out of employ, and many of them, for aught we know to the contrary, houseless wanderers in this distant land, the victims of insatiable avarice or insufferable pride.</p>
<p>What will strangers at a distance think of the stability of the Monster Mine and of proprietors declining to pay their labourers more than 21s a week and their able-bodied miners 30s a week, at the risk of suspending operations and depressing the value of its shares?</p>
<p>What will the Home Government say, at what they must now deem a needless outcry for labour, especially skilled mining labour? Will they not conclude that this colony can only be looked upon as a labour trap?</p>
<p>What will British labourers say in reply to the repeated invitations from the colony through HM Commissioners?</p>

<p>The Libel Action of Mr George Stevenson</p>
<p>The public of SA was recently startled to hear of nine separate actions brought against us by the Burra Burra Board of Directors. Many came forward to express their sympathy with us, boldly and generously. Others followed in their wake and as those actions are still being pursued, despite the publication of an apology, it is more than probable that a fund may be provided, more than sufficient to meet our legal costs. As for our being subjected to a penalty, it is too absurd to be entertained.</p>
<p>Now our ancient enemy, Mr George Stevenson, who fraternizes with the Burra Burra Directors, has also commenced a suit against us.</p>
<p>We could not imagine in what way we had offended him, until we noticed in the letter of our correspondent ‘Teamster’ in last Wednesday’s Register that in commenting upon his conduct as a public journalist, he had been referred to as ‘Honest George’. It is something new to find a man offended by an epithet that is usually regarded as complimentary and stranger still that the ingenuity of lawyers can twist such an expression into a libel, when there is nothing in the context or in what follows to indicate it was intended to be taken other than literally.</p>
<p>‘We can see nothing to apologise for, unless we were to express sorrow for having permitted our correspondent to call him “Honest George”.’</p>
<p>[George Stevenson had been in charge of the SA Register (then the SA Gazette &amp; Colonial Register) up till 1842, when the journal passed into other hands.]</p>
<p>25 November 1848, page 2</p>
<p>George Hogg writes of the subject of the George Stevenson libel case, pouring scorn on someone taking an action against another for calling him ‘honest’.</p>
<p>‘Teamster’, writes 25 November 1848.</p>
<p>[The opening four paragraphs assert the importance of a free press and contend that the freedom of the press is under attack in SA from the actions of a body of rich capitalists. He then goes on the say that the origin of the row lies in the antagonism of capital to labour.]</p>
<p>‘&hellip;the richest mine in the world refusing to give a sufficient wage, a sufficiency of bread, meat and clothes for the labour, that makes the mine-holders rich beyond all belief, and overbearing beyond all precedent. That is the root of the enmity: and because the Register, with boldness and honesty, has taken up the cudgels for the poor teamster and miner, and other wealth-makers, it is to be put hors de combat by law, or through the expense of law; that is the birdseye view of the question.’</p>
<p>Who are the parties to this antagonism? ‘&hellip;the Burra aristocracy on the one hand and the wealth makers, or working men, on the other.’</p>
<p>‘What! Is the shaft of the column to scorn the foundation on which it is reared?’</p>
<p>[He continues for some time in this vein with Biblical as well as contemporary allusions. His next point is that it was to escape the bondage and serfdom that kept workers down in Europe, that they came to this new colony. ]</p>
<p>‘Leave your shaft in the mine, your team on the road, your bench and your workshop, the cow’s tail and the plough’s tail, and if you would rejoice in the victory, come to the battle.’</p>
<p>‘If you are indifferent to the fate of your press, and careless of the results of the question at this time, I. at least, will never again put lance in rest for you. If you give the present opportunity the go-by, then go, submit to your taskmasters in peace; go, make bricks without straw; crave humbly for employment.</p>
<p>“with bated breath and whispering humbleness</p>
<p>Suing in a bondsman’s key.”’</p>
<p>[He concludes by stating that his truthfulness has pierced them to the core and if the Directors should by some necromancy emerge triumphant he will pursue their name so that it live on in infamy and the very absurdity of their action shall save their names from oblivion.]</p>

<p>Burra Sports</p>
<p>First Day</p>
<p>A race was organised on 13 November at the course two miles from Burra. The terms were for £10 a side, one 11⁄2 mile heat and gentlemen riders.</p>
<p>The horses were Mr Humphrey’s br. g. Parson and Mr Hotchin’s bay mare Bride.</p>
<p>Bride, won with ease, though the bets were two to one on Parson.</p>
<p>In a second race there were nine competitors for a handsome saddle valued at £7-10-0.</p>
<p>The first heat was won by Mr Hill’s Will o’ the Wisp and the second heat ended in a dead heat between Will o’ the Wisp and Mr Symons’ grey mare Cherry. In the third heat Cherry won by half a head. Cherry beat Will o’ the Wisp in the fourth heat.</p>
<p>After the above came a £5 match between Mr Ware’s Ginger and Will o’ the Wisp in which Ginger won by a length.</p>
<p>Then came a race for a new saddle worth £5, which was won by Mr T. Wright’s Charley.</p>
<p>The meeting closed with a Hurry-Scurry involving 12 horses. The winner was Ginger.</p>
<p>Second Day</p>
<p>A boxing match was held between Jemmy Dunn, a Burra miner and John Jones, a Sydney native. It was a match for £10 a-side. Minute time was agreed on and 16 rounds were fought.</p>
<p>The match went to Jemmy Dunn.</p>
<p>A £5 a-side match followed between John Fortune (black Jack) and Tom Kelly (Snob) near Bunce’s Shaft. They fought 31 half-minute rounds. After about 45 minutes the match was decided in favour of ‘Jackey the Black’ to the deafening cheers of the assembled hundreds.</p>
<p>It is rare and remarkable that neither pugilist drew blood.</p>

<p>A Public Meeting in Support of John Stephens</p>
<p>[This is a very lengthy report on a public meeting held on the previous Tuesday evening, 28 November, in the New Queen’s Theatre in Adelaide. The building was crammed with some 1,000 people to hear the meeting discuss the freedom of the press and the threat to it posed by the nine actions brought against Mr Stephens, editor of the Register, by the Burra Burra Directors.</p>
<p>C.S. Hare took the chair.</p>
<p>Rev. E. Baker moved a motion expressing the importance of a free press and claiming it as the right of Englishmen.</p>
<p>Like Broadbent moved a resolution condemning any attempt to restrict discussion through the medium of the press, and stating these actions by the Directors of the SA Mining Association were a covert blow aimed at the liberty of the press and at the advocates of truth, freedom and independence.</p>
<p>The third resolution put to the meeting by Mr Bryan called for all who valued a free press to come forward in defence of one who has ‘unflinchingly asserted [the rights of the productive classes] against the combined machinations of a property class’.</p>
<p>Mr Daniel Fisher proposed that the meeting pledged itself individually and collectively to use every lawful influence to protect Mr John Stephens from the consequences of this ninefold attack and called for a committee to organise a Defence Fund.</p>
<p>Each motion was passed without dissent.</p>
<p>Public meetings are also reported to have been held on the same issue at Port Adelaide, Hindmarsh and other places.]</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. On Friday 24 November a young man named Albert Abbott was driving his bullock team laden with ore from the Burra Mine, when opposite the Smelting House he stumbled over a stone. His left shoulder became jammed under the upper felloe and he was dragged some distance before being released by a passer-by. His injuries were such that little hope was held for his recovery and he died on 30 November.</p>
<p>[This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD.]</p>
<p>Accident. James Dunn (Jemmy Dunn, the pugilist) was collecting hay with his team on 27 November with his two boys, when about a mile beyond the Burra Burra Hotel a partly broken-in steer became unmanageable. In attempting to curb the unruly beast, Jemmy’s legs became entangled in a rope and he was dragged a considerable distance – some say half a mile – his clothes being literally torn to pieces. His skin fared little better, being flayed from his body. He managed to keep his head uplifted and called to one of his lads to bring a knife and he at length cut the entangling rope. No bones were broken and the painful injuries were not deep. He is reported to be recovering fast and will, we trust, be spared to his numerous family.</p>
<p>A Letter from a Burra correspondent says most miners have now finished dressing their ores and are doing nothing. Some, having obtained from their assayer in Adelaide (Mr John Rowe) returns of produce for 34, on the 75 standard, have just learnt that Mr Elphick’s returns for the same pile are only 24 and a fraction. They are of course nonplussed by this. Many families have already left and many more are preparing to follow.</p>
<p>Arrival of Migrants [Editorial]</p>
<p>On 5 December four ships arrived carrying free immigrants and other passengers:</p>
<p>The Hooghly departed Plymouth on 14 August (99 days from the Lizard.)</p>
<p>The Baboo left Plymouth on 24 August, the Duke of Bedford on 20th and the Thomas Lowry on 31st.</p>
<p>[The rest of the editorial conveys news from England that arrived with these vessels. It includes news of the Chartist uprising and arrests in Manchester.]</p>
<p>13 December 1848, page 4</p>
<p>William Stevens of Brown Street, Adelaide, writes:</p>
<p>Having a lot of shovels to dispose of, I waited upon Mr Samuel Boord, store-keeper of Hindley Street. When I spread my samples on the floor, he pointed to the largest and said that there was not a d_____d Cornishman in the colony would use it because they were too lazy. I said that if he only paid Cornishmen a good wage he would not find them lazy, and I came away in disgust. Mr Boord has a shop in Burra and would find a good number of Cornishmen amongst his customers. I think he should be the last person to cast aspersions upon their characters.</p>
<p>‘A Correspondent’ writes from Kooringa to comment on a report that some of the Burra miners have returned to work. He says that two parties went to the mine agent late at night and asked that they and their respective pairs might be allowed to resume their labour, thinking, no doubt, that by working in two places, they might be allowed to get more wages. A message was sent to the Secretary and a return came back, but between the office and the blacksmith’s shop the men changed their minds and fearing they would not get more than the new rate of wages, they relinquished the offer and said they were determined not to work without a fair remuneration. Had they persisted I would have given their names, but as they repented in time, I will refrain.</p>
<p>R. Mahon of Hindmarsh writes to comment on the fast approaching actions between the Burra Directors and Mr John Stephens.</p>
<p>With respect to the private characters of the Burra Directors, I make no comment. There are among them individuals for whom I have the greatest respect and whose characters have stood the test of time. However, when the various pursuits of life and especially the pursuit of wealth enter into it, the character of a man in public life is not that of his private life. Mr Stephens has scrutinised the Directors as Editor of the Register, that is, in his public life, not as a private person. I believe the Directors would be justified in their action if they truly believed that their characters had suffered in the estimation of the public, and if a court of law was the only means through which they could gain redress. But, I do not believe this is the case. The Directors are fighting under false colours.</p>
<p>Mr Stephens has ever been the champion of the working classes and has always exposed cases where injured poverty has had to contend with the arrogance of wealth. What is it that prevents the frequent infliction of injuries upon the weak, but the fear of exposure in the columns of the SA Register?</p>
<p>Do not lose sight of the fact that a few actions such as these will, if successful, deprive you of a zealous defender. You are therefore bound by every tie of interest, and by every claim of gratitude, to support the man who has been your steady and your ready friend. Rally therefore in his support.</p>
<p>[The letter is long and the advocacy more detailed and flowery.]</p>

<p>[He continues at length on his ambitions to unite the working classes into a force for their own advancement in a self-supporting and loving brotherhood. He urges new-comers to be careful of their cash, not to rent land or gamble away their reserves, but to buy land directly on offer at the Government Land Office at £1 per acre. He also criticises those who exploit new arrivals by overcharging for the fare from the port to the city. These points are developed at length!</p>
<p>He adds that at the Temperance Hotel discussions of the Science of Society are held in the coffee room and that all men, who wish to be free, should support the Register and the Observer, the only poor man’s newspapers in the colony.]</p>

<p>Adelaide Share Market</p>
<p>Burra Burra £5 shares are being traded almost exclusively for cash. Today’s sales have been at £178 and £177-10-0. A few have been purchased at £185 on a three months’ bill with the purchaser paying the commission.</p>
<p>The meeting of shareholders tomorrow is anticipated with interest. Some are apprehensive of a diminution of the dividend.</p>

<p>The Editorial for the New Year announces a greatly augmented list of subscribers; compared with 1847, an increase of nearly 30%.

<p>Accident. Fears are held for the safety of Mr S. Marks, of the Hindley Street firm of M. &amp; S. Marks.

His brother left the city last night for Kooringa to ascertain his fate.</p>
<p>Christmas 1848 at Kooringa</p>
<p>A large number of people assembled at the Burra racecourse on 27 December for a race meeting.</p>
<p>In the first race over 2 miles Little Wonder, ridden by John O’Leary, won the first heat. Ivanhoe ridden by Wallace Jnr, won the second heat. This result was disputed by Little Wonder’s rider, on the grounds that Ivanhoe’s rider dismounted before returning to the post. Ivanhoe, won the third heat, beating the only other runner, Colonel Ginger after Little Wonder and Parson were withdrawn under protest.</p>
<p>The second race was a 11⁄2 mile hurdle, but it had to be abandoned. Thunderbolt stood stock still before the first hurdle and the Maid of All Work and the Bride refused to take the second hurdle. The prize was added to that for the third race. This was over 11⁄2 miles and was won by Will o’ the Wisp, ridden by Benjamin Bailey.</p>
<p>The next race was for beaten horses, and was won by Colonel Ginger, ridden by John Haimes.</p>
<p>The Hurry Scurry was won by Williamy, ridden by E. Langmead.</p>
<p>The weather was ideal except for the dust.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have to report an accident at the course. William Harris, aged about 13, was knocked down by a horse and suffered contusions and a fractured collar-bone.</p>
<p>Our correspondent speaks very highly of visible improvements in the state of society at Burra Burra. When he went there to live two years ago, he had heard it described as ‘a hell upon earth’. He was determined to see with his own eyes a place which had become so notorious; and now, after the experience of two years, he quite extols the Burra Burra and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>He admits there may be a rough blade or two among them, but in the aggregate there does not exist in this colony, of an equal area, with an equal number of people, a community that better evidences their claim to the coarse, but meaningful title of ‘a set of good fellows’ than the lads of the Burra.</p>
<p>Whatever faults they have in common with the rest of mankind, at any rate they have principle and honesty to boot.</p>
<p>Christmas passed remarkably well. Proper decorum and solemnity throughout the day. Divine worship was observed, public houses and shops were closed and there was no rioting or drunkenness.</p>
<p>6 January 1849, page 3</p>
<p>Morris Marks, writes re the fate of S. Marks as reported in the paper of 3 January. The report then was in error, as neither saddle nor bridle was found on either of the horses.</p>
<p>S. Marks left the Stone Hut with Mr Tapley Jnr, riding one horse and leading another. He stopped for refreshments at Mr Higgins’s and there the horse he was leading got away. In seeking it, he found himself in the Wakefield Scrub. He followed the river to one of Messrs Young’s stations, where he slept for the night, placing the horse in a sheep pen. During the night it got away. The next morning he went to the head station, where he was received with kindness and hospitality.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mine Strike is over. Those men who could afford to hold out and who were proscribed by the Directors, having withdrawn their opposition. A considerable number of pitches were let last week at the Captain’s prices. The number of applicants was large. About 300 are presently employed, with more to come.</p>
<p>There is about 2,000 tons of ore at grass and the Directors, who with the Secretary, returned to Adelaide on Saturday, had decided on a temporary suspension of cartage to the port. The want of this employment will have less impact because the Patent Copper Co. has advertised for workers at their Kooringa copper works. There are said to be many applicants for land near the route between Burra Burra and Adelaide.</p>

<p>‘A Scotchman’ writes from Kooringa, 1 January 1849, that in February last, the Rev. J.C. Bagshaw (Anglican) was appointed to this district. While here, he has truly fulfilled the duties of a Christian pastor. The appointment was intended to be temporary (12 months) and I am given to understand that his slender salary has been defrayed from English Funds and his Bishop (it is said) declines to continue to support a clergyman to benefit a congregation apparently unwilling to defray the costs.</p>
<p>Since Mr Bagshaw’s arrival, a noble building has been erected as a schoolroom, and is temporarily used as a church. Its form is adapted to both uses. This building is being ceiled and plastered and can accommodate 250. All seems to be unaware of the imminent removal of their minister or are too concerned with temporal matters to rouse themselves to address this subject.</p>
<p>I write to try to arouse then to stir themselves to supply the funds necessary for the establishment of a permanent Church of England clergyman in Kooringa and to petition the Bishop to this end.</p>
<p>[Ian Auhl in The Story of the Monster Mine etc. page 300 says that the salary of Bagshaw &amp; his successor Rev. Pollitt, was largely met by the Patent Copper Co. which had recruited him in England to serve as chaplain for their works.]</p>

<p>The Burra Strike</p>
<p>We make a general appeal on behalf of the Men who became Committee Men during the Burra Burra Mine Strike as a consequence of their moral and general standing among their fellow miners. This strike was remarkable for the exemplary conduct of a numerous body of men and the absence of any unmanly or vindictive outrage. A letter from a correspondent, confirmed from other sources, reveals that these men are now doomed to the unrelenting vengeance of the Board and other mining companies have been written to with a view to their being denied employment across the industry. We presume the gentlemen of the Board would be deeply offended if they were told this conduct was inhuman and unchristian, but so it is as long as they ignore the humanizing duty of forgiveness, which the Saviour taught. Vindictive ness is doubly reprehensible in an infant colony where men of various creeds and callings and of endless varieties of disposition, make up an almost indivisible community. The necessity has been suggested to us of a subscription list to aid these right-minded men, who have, with their families, been thrown out of bread by the issue of the late strike.</p>
<p>‘Spectator’ writes concerning the recent strike at Burra Burra Mine.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the strike the acting-captains are under strict instructions to afford no employment whatever to a select list of miners and the men of the committee. These are the men who persevered to the end their prescribed path of duty as members of the committee. Why are they to be selected for special vindictive retaliation and to see their families denied bread; simply because at the start of the strike, they were selected by their fellow miners as having perhaps a better capacity to see, and observe, and act on their behalf. Having been unanimously elected to this duty, they discharged it manfully and without compromise. Let me appeal to patriots, philanthropists and fellow colonists in general to crave your consideration and sympathy. A considerable part of their duty was to see that good and peaceable order was maintained and the Company’s property was preserved without spoliation or injury and ‘bitterly hath Cæsar answered for it’.</p>
<p>I speak on indubitable information that gratuitous advice and earnest requests have been sent to other mines ‘on no consideration to employ’ these luckless prohibited Burra victims’.</p>
<p>Meanwhile most miners have been restored to employment under fair promises and driven by need.</p>
<p>I ask that the Gentlemen of the Press give publicity to this letter in your journals.</p>

<p>The SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The Association presented its Fourth Annual Report and a statement from the Board of Directors to shareholders at the General Meeting on Wednesday last. Both were intelligible, candid and satisfactory. Though an early resumption of handsome dividends is not promised, it is shown to be very likely.</p>
<p>Financial soundness has been re-established and when arrangements have been settled with the Smelting Co. a new career of prosperity can be expected. From what we can infer the arrangements with Messrs Schneider &amp; Co. of the extensive smelting works near Burra Burra, now partially in operations, will prove highly beneficial to both parties. The Association will furnish the Smelting Co. with 10,000 tons of copper ore, of 15-25% produce, during the first year of the contract, and 30,000 tons annually for the following six years, provided so much be raised. This will allow the Association to export the richer ores, should it be found advisable to do so, while providing a vast market at their door for the ores of which the percentage is not such as to bear the heavy transport costs. They will deliver the ores and take as payment merchantable copper at a price proportioned to the current market value. Some have criticised the long term commitment made, but some such arrangement was surely needed to convince the smelting company to invest their capital and skill in the vicinity of the Association’s mine. Consequently the amendment endorsing the contract was carried by a large majority.</p>
<p>Smelting at Burra Burra has already commenced and we trust that this new career of prosperity will obliterate remembrances of past reverses in the affairs of the Monster Mine.</p>

<p>Accident. On Saturday morning at the Burra Burra Mine a whole mass of rubbish fell on a young lad by the name of Vallick, who was employed screening underground. A nearby miner was nearly blinded by the dust. The youth’s body was recovered quickly, but life was extinct. W. Lang Esq. held an inquest on Saturday at 3 o’clock. The jury viewed the body, of which the back of the head was completely smashed and the right leg broken. Evidence was given that the fall was entirely unexpected and the timbering in the area was done with caution and carefulness. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. Deceased was the son of a miner and his poor mother is far advanced in pregnancy. [No one of this name appears in the records of SA Births, Marriages or Deaths. Neither are there likely candidates for the death under other similar names, but on Saturday 12 May 1849 the death is recorded of James Villis (aged 16) in the right district. There is, however, no record of a Mrs Villis fitting the description of ‘far advanced in pregnancy’. Elizabeth and Henry Villis had a son they named James on 24 December 1849. This might fit as a replacement ‘James’ if the interpretation of ‘far advanced’ is rather loose, but this is all speculation.]</p>

<p>Violent Robbery.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mr Robert Henderson, stone mason, was savagely and murderously attacked near the Stone Hut. He was on his way to Adelaide and was carrying three £50 orders on the company for work done by him. He had put up for the night at the Stone Hut public house. It was ingoing out to tend to his horse, that he was attacked and rendered unconscious. When he came to he was barely able to get up and was covered in bruises, with his face horribly swollen and bruised. His pockets he had been rifled of everything, including the three £50 orders. When he returned to the hotel he was surprised when the landlord, Mr Harris, nonchalantly observed that he must have been watched by someone. Police were notified and last night a report was received that the supposed perpetrators were in custody at Gawler.</p>

Evidence was tendered that deceased was playing on the floor in front of the fire with his six-year-old brother, when a kettle of almost boiling water fell off the fire and scalded him. Dr Moore attended, but the extent of the injury was great and the child died the next day. [Neither the birth nor the death of this child seems to appear in SA. Births or SA Deaths CDs.]</p>

<p>Law Courts</p>
<p>William Kelly, George Morgan and William Buckley were charged with the assault and robbery of Robert Henderson at the Stone Hut on 19th instant.</p>
<p>Kelly complained that he had surrendered to face a charge of drunkenness and was now in court with two men he didn’t know for a crime he knew even less about, committed at a place he had never been near. It was explained that he had been identified by Mr Henderson as one of the assailants.</p>
<p>Kelly was fined 5/- for the drunkenness charge and the other charges then proceeded.</p>
<p>Henderson said he had arrived at the Stone Hut about 3 p.m. He did not know the prisoner Morgan, but Kelly and Buckley were both there. Kelly had hounded him for £3, due in wages, but Henderson said he had never employed Kelly. About dusk he went out to let the ostler know he intended an early departure in the morning. Kelly and Buckley followed him and Kelly struck a blow that rendered him unconscious. On coming to he found a red pocket book containing some other papers and three £50 orders from Challoner drawn on the secretary of the SA Mining association, was missing. During the following day he saw Kelly and Buckley still at the public house and they were there when he left on Monday for Gawler, where he reported the matter to police.</p>
<p>Buckley admitted being present, but claimed that he had followed Henderson to prevent him being struck. He also said Kelly was not the man who struck him.</p>
<p>James Dunn, miner, of Burra Burra identified Kelly and Buckley as having been at Burra, where they were employed by the Copper Co. Morgan had also been at Burra, but he believed Morgan had left by himself.</p>
<p>Morgan said he had left with Buckley.</p>
<p>The three were remanded until Saturday week.</p>

<p>The Patent Copper Co. (Williams’) is now smelting day and night. Because an obnoxious and intrusive person had entered the works in disguise, the Manager, Mr Williams, had given orders that no strangers were to be given entry. Nevertheless I was courteously received and shown some ore refuse. The light from the four large furnaces has a magnificent appearance at night.</p>
<p>Entertainment. Lindon &amp; Webster of the Queen’s Theatre were in Kooringa last week. They brought up a number of mechanical figures. Mr Lindon, as maker of these, deserves considerable praise. Several songs and a hornpipe followed. The host of the Burra Hotel allowed the use of his Assembly Room on Thursday and Saturday and it was filled almost to excess.</p>
<p>Weather. Some rain fell on Saturday, but the streets remain comparatively clean compared with Adelaide at present. Last winter Mr S. Marks built a small bridge, a portion of which broke recently. The adjoining occupant of Victoria House talks of effecting repairs.</p>

<p>James Trewartha writes on Miners’ Wages</p>
<p>Following the appearance in two other papers of a letter from Henry Ayers, commenting on my evidence at the trial of Gilles v. Glen Osmond Union Mining Co., I seek this opportunity of clarifying what I was trying to say in my examination.</p>
<p>I said that the wages formerly paid in Cornwall and the Isle of Man was higher than in SA. Except for a brief period near the discovery of the metallic ors in SA, wages here have been lower that in any foreign country where mining has been pursued. For a few years of financial depression at Home, it is true that wages have been depressed, and this has driven miners to emigrate, but rapidly reviving economic circumstances in the UK will see this spur to emigration disappear. The real question involved in the action referred to was the legitimate working of mines with a view to their permanency as profitable speculations. It was alleged that the mine had not been properly worked. Having inspected the underground workings, I was convinced the allegations were true. It was alleged in defence that the high cost of operations here compared with in the UK prevented the development of the resources. This is a remarkable blunder. The costs of working a mine are strongly in favour of the colony. The absence of large machinery and steam power and the shallowness of operations all greatly reduce costs. Nor is the cost of wages an excuse. The Glen Osmond miners have earned little over £1 a week and given the high costs of living in the colony, the local miner is no better off than in Cornwall. My mining experience in Cornwall extended from boyhood to full majority, while my mining qualifications here have been perfected by long experience amid the mining operations of foreign countries and several returns to Cornwall have maintained by knowledge of operations there up to about two years ago. I have been influenced by no private or selfish motive in giving my evidence; in fact I conceived that I had a public duty to perform, since the precedent, once established, of picking out the eyes of the mines in SA, would spell the end to everything like legitimate mining in the future.</p>

<p>Police Court, Saturday 2 June</p>
<p>The case against William Kelly, George Morgan &amp; John Buckley continued.</p>
<p>John Stanley, cook at the Stone Hut, said he knew Morgan and Buckley and saw then at the Stone Hut on 19 May. He saw Henderson go out and saw a man called Wallace accuse Henderson of not paying him 30s for wages. Wallace held the bridle and dared Henderson to go without paying him. Henderson re-entered the hotel. Stanley took the horse to the stable and when he entered the hotel Morgan and Wallace were drinking with Henderson and Buckley. Henderson denied Wallace ever worked for him. They started fighting near the stables when Henderson came to order his horse. Wallace knocked Henderson down. Buckley urged Wallace to stop hitting Henderson. Henderson said he would not go and so Stanley unsaddled the horse. Back inside the hotel Henderson said he had lost his pocket book. Henderson sometimes said the sum was £100 and at another £150 and sometimes said it was cheques and sometimes orders. Wallace and the other two men left soon after Henderson on Monday.</p>
<p>[Robert Harris, publican of the Saddleworth Hotel, gave extensive evidence basically supporting what Stanley had said, but adding that Henderson had arrived intoxicated at about 4 o’clock. On the Sunday Henderson had asked how his face came to be bruised and Wallace said he had done it, because Henderson had struck first. Morgan and Buckley had been very quiet, and tried, especially Morgan, to make peace. Henderson had started out on Sunday morning with Stanley to look after him, but Stanley brought him back after an hour or two. Harris did not know Kelly.</p>
<p>William Spicer of the Para, knew Kelly and had seen him on Tuesday morning 22 May before 10 a.m. in Adelaide.</p>
<p>William Kelly mad a statement that he had been employed by William Spicer to take a dray to port Adelaide and had left Burra 14 May. He recounts the stages of his journey.</p>
<p>John Buckley said he had been working for the Smelting Co. Morgan had also been working there and they were coming to Adelaide together. He saw a man knock Henderson down and advised him not to strike him. The man said if he had anything to say to it, he would knock him down the same way.</p>
<p>His Worship discharged Morgan, admitted Kelly to his own bail to appear at the Sessions and committed Buckley for trial.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening a pair of thieves stole every item of clothing worth having from the dugout occupied by a man called Anderson and three others. The thieves did, however, miss £20 in one pound notes in the pocket of an old dirty pair of trousers. The same thieves stole every stitch of clothing from a bullock driver and then tried to enter the store of Edwin Miller, but here they disturbed Mr Miller and Mr Dyer, who were sleeping in a back apartment when they broke a window. The thieves fled. This town of some 3,500 people is inadequately protected by four policemen, especially given that the police station is a mile from the township. A day or two ago there was bot a grain of gunpowder to be bought in the town. It is said the thieves are from a broken up gang of Melbourne thieves.</p>

<p>27 June 1849, page 4</p>
<p>‘An Adventurer’ writes that his attention has from time to time been drawn to the great discrepancies that occur in copper assays. At Swansea the sale is determined and governed by assays done at Redruth and the correctness is not doubted. Several Cornish assayers have recently arrived, of unquestionable experience. ‘I do not see any difficulty why the average of the numerous small batches of ore here should come to a higher percentage than the cargo, composed of such small batches, assayed by , I believe, by nine different Cornish assayers at Redruth, and sold in Swansea.’</p>

<p>Accident at Burra Burra Mine. Azariah Goldsworthy was working underground when a ponderous mass of ore and rubbish fell from above and almost buried him. He escaped with a broken leg and some lesser injuries. He is recovering under the attention of Dr Moore.</p>
<p>Accident at Kooringa. Mrs Opie, a newly arrived occupier of a dugout, narrowly escaped death when part of the roof fell in. Hearing some ominous sound above her, she managed to gather what she could while encumbered with an infant and tried to flee. As she did so the fall of earth struck a large trunk on end and when this fell against her, she sustained a broken leg. Her infant and her other children were saved.</p>

<p>Kooringa Court House, last Wednesday was densely packed to hear a charge of assault with intent etc. brought by a young girl of the age of 14, named Grace Dunstan against a man aged about 40 named John Williams. The evidence is not fit to print, but the charge failed owing to the girl being contradicted in every particular of her evidence by the prisoner’s witnesses. The Magistrate, in dismissing the case, advised the parties to get married as soon as possible. This had not happened at the time of our latest intelligence.</p>
<p>[The registration of Marriages in SA records the marriage of John Williams aged 28 to Grace Dunstone aged 16 at the residence of Henry Dunstone in Kooringa on 22 July 1849.</p>
<p>Two children are registered to the couple; in 1853 and 1854 at Kensington.</p>
<p>The name is too common to trace with any confidence through Births and deaths records, but one death is suggestive. John Williams died at Kensington 20 June 1855 when his age was given as 37. Grace Williams aged 25 married Thomas Goldsworthy 5 February 1859 at the residence of her father, Henry Dunstan at Kensington. This couple is recorded as having two sons and four daughters between 1859 and 1877 and the mother’s maiden name is then variously Dunston, Dunstan and Dunstone. The 1859 child was born at Kooringa, the 1861 child at Kensington and the others at Moonta.]</p>

<p>Resident Magistrate’s Court Kooringa, 13 July, before W. Lane, Police Commissioner.</p>
<p>[Is this an error for W. Lang, Resident Magistrate?]</p>
<p>The inconveniently small room was crammed almost to suffocation to hear the case of John Jones, a note pugilist, who was charged by John Ryan with assault and robbery.</p>
<p>Ryan appeared to be severely injured about the head and face. He deposed that he resided at Kooringa and on Sunday 8 July he had gone to Emu Springs, some 14 miles from Kooringa. When he was about to return home the accused seized his bridle and refused to let him go until he had him and his friends to grog. Ryan agreed and ordered the landlord to give Jones a bottle of brandy. As Ryan left Jones then followed him and when out of sight of the house he dragged Ryan from the horse, beat him severely and then stole a silver watch, a shilling and a black silk handkerchief.</p>
<p>Bridget Lynch, a servant at Emu Springs, said Ryan was there on 8 July and so was Jones. She had seen the silver watch in Ryan’s possession, but had not seen Jones follow him. After a while Ryan’s horse returned riderless. She went out and found Ryan insensible.</p>
<p>Thomas Tapley, landlord of the ‘Emu Springs’ gave evidence essentially confirming the above and said he and another man had gone out and collected Ryan after Bridget Lynch had reported him lying insensible. Ryan had been ‘rather intoxicated’ when he left the hotel.</p>
<p>Jones deposed that he had been at the hotel, had left, and returned because he had broken a bottle of grog and came back to get another. The road to his house was in a different direction from Ryan’s and he did not know anything about the robbery.</p>
<p>Jones was committed for trial.</p>

<p>A total eclipse of the sun will be seen today in Adelaide. It will begin at 12.35 p.m. and end at 8 minutes before sunset.

<p>Prize Boxing is rife in Kooringa, with sums of £1 to £5 a-side being staked. There are too few police to interfere in this brutalising amusement. After one such fight between ‘Paddy the Horse’ and ‘Scotchy’ some men of violence, miscalling themselves ‘miners’ got up a row with a few Aboriginals, one of whom received a blow that would have fractured a white man’s skull. The Mine officers have discharged some of the principal movers of these fights, so prejudicial to their interests and to the public peace. The Resident Magistrate Mr Lang suppressed one fight due to take place near his house.</p>
<p>Obituary. On 14 July trooper Guy of the Mounted Police arrived in Kooringa from Clare Village with the news that a respectably dressed man had been found dead in the bush about seven miles from Mr Hawker’s Bungaree Station. A carpet bag was near the body. Mr Lang was not well enough at the time to travel such a distance to hold an inquest.</p>
<p>Burra Court. Mr Lang recently observed to a gentleman of the press that he wished someone of his profession would call attention to the miserable accommodation afforded. There was not even a seat to offer a person of respectability. We have been told that at the new township of Redruth there is a convenient empty room in the stone-built barrack there, which could be furnished if the Government were so inclined.</p>

<p>‘Observer’ writes on the Monster Mine and Smelting Works.</p>
<p>The operations at the Monster Mine are proceeding with vigour and the engine-house will soon be completed and it is expected that the engine will be doing its duty in les than three months. The Patent Copper Co. is carrying out its interesting processes effectively. Unfortunately I have a bone to pick with its manager. I learn that last Monday more than thirty hands were dismissed on the excuse that there was not enough work to occupy them. A couple of these men said they had been contracted with in Adelaide for 21/- a week, with the company agreeing to pay 10/- towards the carriage hire, with the men paying the other 10/-. It had cost another 10/- for necessaries on the road and 12/- for a week in Adelaide before they could come to Burra. Another 12/- had been expended in Burra before they began remunerative work. Now they have been discharged before a chance of recovering the £1-12-0 expended to get there. Surely this is not proper behaviour Mr Overseer.</p>
<p>As well as that; some time ago parties with bullocks and drays entered into contracts to supply 1,000 tone of wood. One such has now injured his back after supplying 600 tons and is under Dr Moore’s care. He has sought to be released from the reminder of the contract, but the Overseer has threatened a prosecution for the bonded penalty of £50.</p>
<p>[The Editor said he published this complaint to allow the Overseer an opportunity of making any explanation the circumstances may require.]</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. W. Wyatt, coroner, held an inquest on 21 July at the ‘Golden Phœnix’ near the Yatala Smelting Works on the body of Jesse Sydenham, a bullock driver aged 101⁄2. Edmund Sydenham, son of George Sydenham and brother of the deceased, said he was driving his team two drays behind that of the deceased on the previous Monday, on the road from Yatala to Burra Burra. Seeing the team jump on one side, he stopped his own team and went forward. He found the deceased lying on the ground. The dray wheel had passed over him, but he was not dead. Witness went to the smelting works for a doctor, but when he returned Jesse was dead. It was the first time the deceased was in sole charge of a team, though he had been with them before. When they had started out deceased had been sitting on the front rail of the dray with his feet on the pole.</p>
<p>Dr E. Davey had seen the deceased about noon lying on a sofa in Mr Nocks’s house. The marks on the body suggested the wheel had passed over the body obliquely from his right hip to the left side of his chest. He attributed death to internal injuries from this event. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death and drew the attention of the Government to the need for legislation to prevent the employment of children of a tender age from driving bullock-drays or other vehicles, which they are evidently incompetent to manage. Edward Sydenham was 19 and we noted he was unable to write his name and made his mark on the deposition.</p>

<p>The population of Kooringa is nearly 4,000. New buildings are continually rearing their heads. It is said at least 200 are in the course of construction or about to be started. Allotments of land are continually being sought. Our neighbours, we hear, are in possession of two lodges of Oddfellows and are contemplating the erection of a third. A printing office is talked of, as well as a public, library, a theatre, two or three eating houses and coffee-rooms and other token of improvement.</p>

<p>The Kooringa Postmaster is also the Resident Magistrate’s clerk. This sometimes means business takes him away from the town and then the post office is locked and those seeking mail are disappointed. A flagstaff and flag, as are used in Adelaide to indicate when his Excellency is at home, would be expensive and troublesome, but some sort of gong might be devised to be sounded when the postmaster is ‘At Home’.</p>
<p>At Kooringa there has been an almost daily series of weddings, but there is a dearth of firewood. The advent of the great Smelting Company has seen timber cleared in all directions.</p>
<p>[There is a peculiar and unclear reference to the possible partial destruction of a row of brick houses of the Mining Company, apparently following Mr Stephens’s lecture on Sanitary Reform. Unclear because the writer says the information comes from an informant who is often humorous.]</p>
<p>The slaughterhouses of the butchers are mentioned in terms of apprehension.</p>
<p>When flour was £10 a ton in Adelaide and cartage to Kooringa was £1-5-0 a 4 lb loaf of bread cost 7d.</p>
<p>Now that flour costs £12 a ton and the cartage is £3, a 4 lb loaf here costs 6d.</p>
<p>Prices of beef and mutton are down to 1d, 11⁄2d and 2d, instead of 11⁄2d, 2d and 21⁄2d as they should be.</p>
<p>[The explanation of this is given in convoluted Victorian prose, but, if I have unravelled that correctly, it would seem that some rich tradesman can afford to sell below cost for a time to drive out honest traders, but the writer fears that once the honest tradesmen have been cut out, the townsfolk will find the advantage to be an illusion. He encourages them to stick to the skilful and honest tradesmen.]</p>

<p>Charles Aimey Wilson, a German, was charged with using threatening and abusive language. Louisa Kearnel said the defendant came to her house on 16 August, threatened to strike her, and used abusive language. He was drunk at the time. Wilson admitted going to the house, but denied the offences. As it was a first offence, the Magistrate imposed a fine of 5/-.</p>

<p>James Taylor, storekeeper, was accused by John Saunders of using offensive language to his wife, Eliza Saunders. The offence occurred when he came to secure the release of his horse from the pound and was told the fee was 2/91⁄2.</p>
<p>John Packham, employed by Mr Saunders, confirmed Eliza Saunder’s evidence.</p>
<p>Taylor was fined 5/- plus costs.</p>
<p>William Edward Barnes, ore-dresser, was charged on suspicion of having altered an order drawn by Thomas H. Williams, Superintendent of the Patent Copper Co. works, on the Manager of the same company. Joseph Wood, clerk at the Patent Copper Co., said he had compared the order with its counterpart and said it had been clumsily changed from £2 to £2-15-0. The order was drawn in favour of C. Jacques. Charles Jacques said he recalled receiving the £2 order, but could not recall to whom he paid the order.</p>
<p>Alfred Richard Hurst, a waiter at Wren’s [Burra] Hotel said the prisoner had presented the order at the hotel. He noticed that the 15/- was written in different coloured ink from the £2.</p>
<p>[Corporal Duins gave evidence and eventually the order was traced from John White, ore-dresser, to William Stevens, Barnes’ employer, who paid Barnes with it as part of the £3-10-0 due for wages.]</p>
<p>The Magistrate decided that there was insufficient evidence to prove Barnes had altered the order, but bound him over in his own recognisances to answer any charge that might be preferred against him at the next Criminal Sessions.</p>

<p>Redruth Land Sale</p>
<p>Despite bad weather an immense number of Kooringa people assembled at the Police-barracks on Wednesday morning at 11 a.m. The bidding for the first lo9t was spirited until it reached £100, when it was knocked down to Mr Ayers, for the SA Mining Association. The same result followed for No. 2 at £150, No. 3 at £200. A similar battle ensued for No. 5, which eventually went to Mr V. Solomon for £400. This was the highest price paid for any allotment. It soon became apparent that the Mining Company was determined to buy the whole township if possible. Mr V. Solomon contested many lots, but in the end could buy only 15. The Burra Burra Company secured 77. With only 120 lots, this left just 21 to go to other bidders [seven being reserved for Government use]. The lowest price was £5-1-0 and the total for the whole sale of 120 lots was the enormous sum of £5,067-9-0.</p>

<p>Township of Aberdeen: on the Bon Accord Property, adjoining the Burra Burra Mine.</p>
<p>Samson &amp; Wicksteed &amp; Co. (successors to Mr John Bentham Neales) have been honoured with instructions from the proprietors to offer the same at public sale on the ground on 15 September at noon. The whole of the township will be offered in allotments suitable for building and other purposes. The proprietors reserve all mineral rights, but as the town is laid out on the land least likely to be disturbed by mining, this in all probability will be merely a dead letter. The auctioneers draw the attention of those disappointed in the sale of Redruth, to this township, which is in point of situation, far superior. Catalogues and plans will be available prior to the sale.</p>
<p>Terms 20% cash, 20% in 6 months, 20% in 12 months, 20% in 18 months and 20% in 24 months.</p>

<p>The South Australian ‘Redruth’</p>
<p>The sale of Redruth on 29 August was quite extraordinary, as already reported. Of the 120 allotments, 7 were reserved by the Government and sum of £5067 odd was obtained from the other lots offered, generally each of less than half an acre and totalling less than 28 acres of ‘wild’ land. The upset [or minimum] price set by the Government would have realised only £574-5-0, but two of the allotments nearly trebled that total; having been knocked down for £400 and £350 respectively.</p>
<p>The 1,040 town acres originally laid out as Adelaide and at the Port realised only £3,991-16-0 (reckoning 12/- per acre from the preliminary holders of 437 and the full average for the reserved acres), and yet that sale was considered a mighty achievement.</p>

<p>The Sale of the Township of Aberdeen</p>
<p>The sale of Aberdeen on 15 September attracted a great number of people. The mineral rights being reserved, the Burra Burra Co. was prevented from trying to monopolise the sale, as they had done at the sale of Redruth on 29 August. Of the 144 lots on offer, the auctioneer could only induce people to buy about 20. Intending purchasers seemed to be of the view that the minimum prices set were too high. ‘There is no doubt that had the prices been moderate, the entire of the township would readily have found purchasers, and have been speedily covered with buildings.’</p>

<p>Kooringa is growing speedily. The almost total absence of crime among the nearly 5,000 inhabitants, speaks loudly of their morality. Even so, it was not wise to have left so much life and property without a single policeman, as happened recently for eight days. Storekeepers and others are very dissatisfied at the indifference shown by Adelaide authorities to the importance of the place, which is second only to Adelaide. Authorities need to pay immediate attention to the disgusting state of slaughterhouses and other nuisances. Unless they are regulated or removed from the town precincts, the hot weather will doubtless bring outbreaks of diseases. Entire bullocks’ heads, sheep’s heads and offal of various kinds are strewn about in all directions. Previously roving pigs and dogs devoured this, but now the Company has stepped in and impounded straying pigs and so it is left to putrefy and decay. Some of the huts in the creek are fearfully overcrowded with as many as twenty people or four families in a single dwelling. The houses being built by the company are nearing completion, but very many more are needed. The unwholesomeness of the crowded creek dwellings, without ventilation and on the banks of a creek nearly stagnant and impregnated with copper, must be apparent to everyone. Despite the overcrowding the mortality remains small, but the coming summer heat may bring it forth to an enormous extent. The inhabitants endeavour to make the place more wholesome with plenty of whitewash, but it will be a good day when there are no inhabitants in the holes in the banks of the Burra Creek.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. William Lang, coroner, held an inquest at Kooringa on Monday 24 September, on the body of Richard Gilbert, who died suddenly the previous evening. From the evidence it appears that the deceased, who had lived with his parent in a hut on the bank of the creek, had laboured under a disease of the heart. He was an ore-dresser at the Mine and had worked there on Friday. Feeling unwell on Saturday, he did not go to work. Dr Bull said the deceased had extensive heart disease and such sufferers frequently died suddenly. The verdict was ‘Died by the visitation of God.’</p>

<p>Grace Hosking was charged with assaulting Rose Kemp. She admitted the assault, but pleaded the provocation of having had aspersions cast on her chastity. Hosking promised to pay the medical costs and was ordered to pay the court costs.</p>
<p>Charles James Ware, publican [of the Miners’ Arms] charged William Hall with riotous and disorderly conduct at the hotel. Charge withdrawn, upon the defendant promising better behaviour.</p>
<p>2 October</p>
<p>George Riley, stonemason, charged John Clark with absconding from work on 28 September. Defendant had entered into an agreement of two years to be taught the trade. Clark said on the day in question Riley had told him to go about his business, which he took to mean he had been dismissed. Riley admitted saying the words, but did not mean the agreement to be broken. Case dismissed, as it was clear complainant had himself broken the agreement.</p>
<p>4 October</p>
<p>Christina McPherson charged John Brash with breaking down her door and assaulting her on 2 October. After describing the event and the damage to her furniture as well, complainant called a man named Ballman, who confirmed the property damage.</p>
<p>Brash said McPherson had left her husband in England to come to SA with him. When he heard a man’s voice inside the house he had told her to turn the man out. McPherson had dragged him inside and Ballman had struck him; the furniture was broken in the scuffle.</p>
<p>The Magistrate considered the complaint proved, fined Brash 20/- and ordered him to pay 28/- for damage to the furniture and 22/- costs and to be bound over to keep the peace for three months.</p>
<p>5 October</p>
<p>T.H. Williams of the Smelting Works charged John Prosser and David Jones with refusing to work. He produced agreements for them to work at the smelters for seven years.</p>
<p>Prosser had refused to work because he had not been provided with a particular house.</p>
<p>Jones refused because his son, aged about 16, was not receiving adult wages.</p>
<p>Defendants (through an interpreter, because they were Welsh) said Mr Williams had broken many promises to them.</p>
<p>The Magistrate said that if they had complaints against Mr Williams, he would be quite willing to hear them, but the agreement stood and they had broken it. On their agreeing to return to work, His Worship ordered their wages be abated 30/- and they pay costs.</p>
<p>6 October</p>
<p>Two cases were brought against John Gallienne, an elderly man; one of stealing a shirt, the property of John Hawke and one of stealing a pair of trousers, the property of Stephen Brown. Jane Hodge identified the shirt as one she had made and Mrs Jane Brown identified her husband’s trousers. Corporal Duins had found the items at Gallienne’s hut. The accused was committed for trial.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>Another survey took place on 27 September. The miners were told by the deputed Directors that from the close of the week they would allow no grass-men more than 21/- a week in lieu of the 30/- previously. The miners protested strongly that they could not get grass-men able to properly dress the ore for a guinea a week. The Secretary told them that they must then be fools to be paying ore-dressers 30/- a week when they were only earning 15/- a week themselves. He could readily procure men, as there were hundreds starving in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Can this be true? I had always heard there was no starvation in this land of plenty. If true, how is it that steps are not being taken to halt immigration?</p>
<p>A day or two later twelve of the grass-men went to the Mine Office to discharge themselves from the Mine and to apply for arrears owed to them.</p>

<p>The Far Famed Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>On the 17 October the Directors of the SA Mining Association held their 9th half-yearly meeting. We deem it necessary to explain to recent arrivals why the report and associated documents do not appear in our advertising columns.</p>
<p>In September 1849 the Directors not only declared a repetition of those 200% dividends which had astounded colonists and electrified people in distant climes, but declared their ability to maintain these returns to the tune of 800% p.a. We, being in possession of some very intelligible financial rumours we did not hesitate to put the several parties concerned upon their guard. Firstly those officially responsible and those who stood possessed a strong pecuniary interest in Burra Burra affairs. Secondly those who intended to become deeply interested in the mine and received as commercially orthodox every favourable report and believed everything that tended to exalt the renowned Burra Burra. Thirdly those plodding colonists who were in danger of being induced to desert their desks and counters to rush to the ‘copper-field’ in the Californian manner. And lastly those practical miners to whom we are so much indebted and who had been offered such inducements to leave their British homes in order to be come free and liberally remunerated labourers in SA, and whose legitimate earnings we feared would be improperly interfered with in the over-weening desire of the Directors to continue the payments of such preposterously large dividends.</p>
<p>The Directors grew so wrathful with us that they stopped their advertisements in this paper. They also commenced nine actions-at-law against us.</p>
<p>The fate of the nine actions is well known. Subsequent events and developments have shown that we were right. Legal engines have ceased to assail us and a calm has settled over the troubled waters.</p>
<p>Though still no advertisements come our way.</p>
<p>The SA Mining Association was established on 16 April 1845. The capital stock originally subscribed and paid up was £12,320 and so successful has the venture been that no further call has been made for funds.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mines were opened on the 29 September 1845 and the era of their astonishing productiveness may be dated from the following day. Between 30 Sept 1845 and 30 September 1846 more than 6,359 tons of copper ore was raised and in the time to 29 September last the quantity produced has exceeded 37,735 tons.</p>
<p>Of this 18,567 tons realised an average of £14-10-3 clear of freight and charges and taking the whole produce of the mine at this rate, we should have the enormous product of £547,629-3-9. However, prices in the British copper ore market in the last six months have fluctuated to the extent of £3 per ton and so this calculation will not hold up. Nevertheless, the Burra Burra Mines to 29 September 1849 will be found to have realised a sum largely exceeding half a million pounds sterling, clear of freight and charges.</p>
<p>These returns have either already been obtained or are forthcoming from the (colonial) Patent Copper Co., to whom have been delivered copper ores exceeding 2,466 tons.</p>
<p>Against the cooper ores so delivered the Sa Mining Association has, in possession, reversion, or expectancy, sums amounting to £23,244-7-2, so that after allowing for £286-3-6 for the carriage of metallic copper from the Patent Copper Company’s works, the Association realises £5,000 more than if they had been sent to Swansea or any other copper market or smelter in Britain.</p>
<p>This result is an important feature of the Associations prosperity. Although the ores sent to the Patent Copper Company do not have the greatest percentage of copper, they give a nett return to the Association of £9-6-8 per ton. The richer ores sent to Swansea and elsewhere in Britain did not nett more than an average £7-6-1 per ton at the mines.</p>
<p>The dividend paid on 5 October was 100% and the Directors have expressed a hope that nothing will prevent a continuation of such dividends. The whole of the dividends paid amounting to £135,520 represents 1,100% on the capital originally subscribed and have been paid from the actual profits realized from the working of the Mine from 29 September 1845 to 31 December 1947; a period of 27 months.</p>
<p>Independent of any mineral estate, the Association has lands, tenements, buildings, mining plant etc. giving a nett receivable surplus of £43,904-19-8 available for future dividends.</p>
<p>The Association’s establishment at the Burra Burra Mine (including 16 officers and two surgeons) is 726 persons and this is expected to increase considerably as a result of the operation of their powerful steam engine from today. The population of the Township of Kooringa already exceeds 4,000.</p>
<p>The 30 fathom level is the deepest mentioned in Captain Roach’s report. He expects from seven pitches at this level to produce 500 tons in a ‘take’ of six weeks. In one lode he reports driving through oxide and malachite varying in length from one to eight fathoms with ore varying from 40-48%.</p>
<p>At the half-yearly meeting the services of the office-bearers was thankfully acknowledged.</p>
<p>C.S. Penny was elected to a vacant seat among the Directors.</p>
<p>Mr Brown unsuccessfully that the opinion of counsel be sought as to the practicability of dividing the £5 shares into five £1 shares and of opening an office in London for the transfer of shares and the payment of dividends to proprietors resident in England. Mr Stocks Jnr seconded the first part of this proposal, but not the latter part because he wished to see the property confined as much as possible to residents of SA. Mr C.S. Penny seconded the proposal for a London office. Mr Peacock was opposed to any change. The proposal failed.</p>

<p>Police Need at Kooringa</p>
<p>A memorial signed by over 300 people has been prepared for presentation to His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor, calling for the Police Act to be extended to Kooringa. It is essential that the inadequate police presence in the town be increased. There are many absolute vagabonds infesting the place and scarcely a night passes without petty thefts. Last Sunday night several horses and saddles were stolen. These might have been recovered, but was deemed inexpedient to leave the town without police protection, which would have been the result if the two policemen here had taken up the pursuit. James French, a carter at the Patent Copper Co.’s works, was knocked down and robbed of £4 in Burra orders, while on his way home last Sunday evening. Afterwards he was followed home, apparently by confederates, who threatened to clean him out.</p>

<p>Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 17 October.</p>
<p>John Prout was charged by William Isaac Kerr with altering an order on the Patent Copper Co. from £1 to £9. Kerr is a hawker and he alleged that Prout came to his cart outside the Miner’s Arms on 13 October and purchased £1 worth of goods, offering the £9 order produced in court, as payment. Kerr gave the change and then went to the Patent Copper Co. to get a new order, as it was very worn. He was told it was an order for £1.Thomas H. Williams, Superintendent of the Patent Copper Co., confirmed this evidence. Charles James Ware gave evidence of seeing Prout make the transaction described above and was corroborated by James Sanderson. Prout denied having any transaction of any sort with Kerr. Azariah Goldsworthy and John Farley both swore that Prout was in the Miners’ Arms from 4 to twilight and so could not have had a transaction with Kerr. Prout was committed for trial.</p>
<p>‘Tre-Pol-Pen’ writes from Adelaide 18 October 1849.</p>
<p>[He writes in response to a letter that appeared in the Register on 22 September, in which he says William H. James attacked the present method of disposing of mineral lands in SA, without offering any practical method of improvement.]</p>
<p>The comparison with Cornwall is meaningless. In Cornwall all the land is in private hands; while in SA most of the lands yet vest in the crown. Anyway, what is the case in Cornwall – the discoverer does not get a bonus, nor does usage recognise any claim to a grant. All is optional for the proprietor, who may work the ground himself, or he may delegate that power to others. The discoverer never gets it unless it is a respectable company of adventurers, who undertake to work the discovery and pay to the proprietor a rent or rate of dues proportional to the produce raised.</p>
<p>In SA the discovery is actually in a better position. He often has the opportunity of buying the land from the Crown at a comparatively nominal figure (never the case in Cornwall) and if he has no capital, he can still obtain that end by co-operation with other parties. If the discovery is on private land he can proceed as he would in England.</p>
<p>The assertion that there are vast mineral deposits known, but kept secret in SA is all moonshine. It is, after all, only in connection with capital that mineral property is rendered available and advantageous. The discovery in itself is not the whole; the operations of extraction must be carried on. Without capital, the ownership of mineral property would be an evil rather than a benefit, since such parties might choose to keep from the public the exploration of such minerals as would be of benefit to the general prosperity.</p>
<p>B.G. writes from Kooringa 16 October.</p>
<p>Let me call the attention of the Governor to the numerous robberies occurring here night after night, in consequence of there being no foot police to prevent such occurrences. It is ridiculous to think that two mounted police could prevent such occurrences. Are officials aware that there are now more than 4,000 souls in the township? I am convinced that unless we have at least six more police to protect the inhabitants, some serious burglaries will be perpetrated.</p>

<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel has been much improved and enlarged. Seating for 450 (120 free) has been provided at an expense of about £470. The chapel was re-opened last Sunday 21 October. Three impressive opening services were delivered by Mr Nicholls of Adelaide, Rev. J. Symons of Kapunda and Rev. D.J. Draper. On Monday more than 400 people took part in a tea meeting in the Chapel. The ladies of the congregation provided this without cost to chapel funds. A public meeting followed, at which addresses were given by the three preachers named above. The proceeds of the tea-meeting and the service collections amounted to £102.</p>

<p>[He defends the expertise of W.H. James and disputes the description of Cornwall as being all in private hands. Also he says mining grants there are often in the first instance given to the finder, who undertakes exploratory work to establish whether it is worthwhile for a company or partnership to embark upon the concern. He also says that even in a short residence in the colony he has been made aware of many instances where mineral discoveries have been kept secret because those who know cannot at present buy the sections.]</p>

<p>Mineral Report, by Mr Trewartha of certain lands on the new road to the Burra Mine and on the Wakefield near Emu Plains and in the Murray Scrub east of the Burra Mines.</p>
<p>Of the sections lying near the new road from Burra to the head of St Vincent’s Gulf, he found flat, low ground with no reason to declare then mineral land.</p>
<p>Copper was found in several places in the ranges south of Emu Plains, north of the Wakefield River and west of Skillogolee Creek. This is a continuation of the metalliferous channel seen in the Emu Plains sections. He thinks it might be advantageous to lay out more section sin this district.</p>
<p>A large lode of iron mixed with copper was discovered at Gum Creek, where applications have been made. Mr Trewartha will report more fully on this when sections have been laid out. About three miles north of the Bon Accord copper was found on the surface in several places and a more detailed report will be made when this district too has been surveyed.</p>
<p>The Murray Scrub about 20 miles east of Kooringa was visited and a remarkable formation met with. It consists of quartz, clay, iron and a slight mixture of copper. Specimens have been sent to the Land Office.</p>
<p>At the request of Mr Williams, manager of the Patent Copper Co. Mr Trewartha investigated some land about three miles northeast of the Burra Mine where there are large bodies of silicious rocks, well adapted to the making of fire-bricks and therefore likely, in his opinion, to prove a valuable discovery.</p>

<p>Burra Lodge of the Independent Order of Oddfellows M.U. assembled on Thursday 29 November to witness the laying of a foundation stone for a new lodge room about to be erected in Kooringa. The lodge has been open about nine months and has about 100 members. This has become too many for the large room at the Burra Burra Hotel, used until now for meetings. Under the stone was laid a bottle containing a Burra Burra order for 5/-, a Patent Copper Co. order for 5/- , a Boord Bros order for 5/- and a Wren’s order for 5/-, a piece of refined copper from the smelters, a list of the brothers and a written explanation of the contents. Rev. Bro. Pollitt delivered a short address. The procession then returned to the Burra Burra Hotel for a sumptuous repast, at which almost 100 sat down. The Noble Grand took the chair, supported by Rev. Bro. Pollitt, W. Lang Esq.; Bro. George Bull, Surgeon to the Lodge; Bro. Dr Chambers and other gentlemen.</p>

<p>Township of Redruth</p>
<p>In consequence of the enormous prices to which the allotments were run up by the Burra Company in August, the sale of the town had not been completed. It was again put up for auction on Wednesday last. The Deputy Surveyor assisted by the Postmaster commenced the sale. Because there had been little publicity, scarcely anyone attended and the bidding was low. At noon the Postmaster had to attend the Magistrate’s Court and the auction was adjourned for an hour. When it resumed the prices bore no comparison to those in August. The highest price was £8. The total amount was £377. The total amount was £377, while at the first sale the total exceeded £5,000. William Paxton was the greatest purchaser and in fact the only speculator who attended the sale.</p>
<p>[Note that this report is inconsistent with the report in the paper of 1 September 1849. There it is stated that the SA Mining Association secured 77 and Mr Solomon got 15. This left only 21. If all 21 were offered at the second sale they could not have realised £377 if the top price was £8. One, at least, of these reports is therefore unreliable.]</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. On Friday last, at the Smelting Works, a scaffolding thirty feet high collapsed and took with it an unfortunate mason, named John Fox. He fell amid a pile of stones and timber and was badly mutilated. Drs Bull and Bryden attended, but he was beyond human aid. He died on Sunday. An inquest on Monday by Mr Lang found he had met his death by pure accident. His funeral on Tuesday was accompanied by a very large crowd including the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows in deep mourning regalia. At the head of that group were Rev. J. Lowe, the Wesleyan Minister and Dr Bull, the lodge surgeon. A large collection of the lodge Brothers followed and then the workmen of the Patent Copper Co., with a large number of townsfolk after that. We understand that the Oddfellows’ Lodge is bearing the full cost of the funeral even though the deceased had not been a member long enough to qualify for funeral benefits.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. An inquest was held at Kooringa on 26 December before W. Lang Esq. on the body of John Smith, a seaman aged 24. From the evidence the deceased went to the house of a German named Karrall at the Burra Burra and asked for a light for his pipe. This was given him. He went away, but then returned asking for another light and offering to pay for it. He got a second light, but some words occurred between him and Karrall. The deceased then said he would burn down the house and he put a candle up to the roof. Karrall’s wife tried to snatch the candle and it fell to the ground. Karrall then asked Smith to go. Smith did not, and some sort of quarrel ensued in which Karrall struck Smith on the head with a stool, before going inside and closing the door. Smith then broke in the door and began throwing stone and staves from a cask into the house. Karrall then went out and struck Smith on the back of the head with an axe, causing him to bleed. Smith then went away a short distance, as far as the corner of Mr James’s store, where he met some men, but said nothing of significance to them. They saw Smith return to Karrall’s house and burst open the door. Karrall then came out and struck Smith on the top of the head with the edge of the axe, literally burying it in his head, the skull being completely cut in two and the heel of the axe coming into contact with the brain. Dr Bull was quickly on the scene and the deceased was then gasping his last breaths. He was removed to Wren’s Burra Burra Hotel, where he was found to be dead. The jury found a verdict against Karrall for the wilful murder of John Smith and he was accordingly committed for trial. [John Smith died 25 December 1849. The German’s name was Gottlieb Kiernall.]</p>

<p>Railways in SA</p>
<p>[There is a long article by W.S. Chauncey, Civil Engineer, on the benefits of constructing railways in SA in which some of the main points are:</p>
<p>Population and production are growing rapidly, creating transport needs.</p>
<p>Roads are appalling.</p>
<p>There is a lack of opportunity for canals.</p>
<p>Railways will open the colony for development of natural resources, particularly minerals.</p>
<p>Land along the railways would become more valuable and agriculture would be encouraged.</p>
<p>A line to the Burra Burra Mine is proposed; that being the most heavily travelled route.</p>
<p>Stations are contemplated every 5 to 7 miles.</p>
<p>The writer discusses the alternatives of horse-drawn tramways and steam railways. He concludes that steam railways are needed, but that the relatively light traffic here will only justify light railways with light locomotives travelling at low speeds. (12-15 m.p.h. is suggested.) Details of rails and sleepers and the costs involved are then discussed, and then figures are given for likely traffic between Burra and Adelaide. The writer calculates that a line to the Burra Mine could generate a profit of 20% on the capital invested of £225,000. Relative costs of horse and steam power are tabulated and show considerable advantage in favour of steam. The writer concludes that horse power may be viable on very lightly used short branch lines. Horse drawn tramways may be viable where there is light traffic over short distances because time/speed becomes less of an issue and costs at 21⁄2 m.p.h. are not very much greater than for steam power.]</p>

<p>Accident. Last Monday evening an accident occurred about two miles north of Gawler. The Clare mail-cart ran against a stump and capsized, throwing all its passengers onto the road. The Burra Burra coach was following and in the cloud of dust could not avoid colliding with the overturned cart. Several of the carts passengers were injured. Mr Bleechmore was severely hurt and is not expected to live. Mrs Greenslade received leg injuries and Mt Witton, the musician, injured his shoulder. Another young woman was also hurt. Gawler doctors attended and the injured were taken into Gawler on litters. Mr Bleechmore was on the way to Adelaide to give evidence in a felony case.</p>

<p>Obituary. Samuel Stocks Jnr died at his residence in Hindley Street West last Sunday morning at 6.30 a.m. He arrived in the colony about seven years ago and commenced his career as a merchant, with a fair promise of success and was regarded by numerous friends as a valued member of the community. His disposition and manners were frank and his mercantile qualifications of a superior order. He was one of the original Burra Burra proprietors and the securing of the Special Survey was in no small way due to his activity and influence. He amassed considerable wealth through that venture and, withdrawing from his commercial pursuits in Adelaide, he undertook the superintendence of the Mine for a considerable period. In that role his admirable management, in which liberality, good nature and business tact were blended, caused him to be greatly esteemed. The large and sudden accumulation of property, however, proved a snare, and the deceased unhappily fell into habits of intemperance, which clouded the latter portion of his life, and undermined a fine natural constitution. ‘In his last moments he was able to express contrition, and his sorrowing friends have hope in his death.’</p>
<p>[Samuel Stocks Jnr died 3 February at Adelaide aged 37.</p>
<p>Samuel Stocks Sen. died 8 March 1863 aged 76 at Prospect Village. Both arrived in SA in 1843.]</p>

<p>Floods. ‘The floods have done serious damage in the neighbourhood of Kooringa. Seventy-five of the habitable grottoes in and about the banks of the Burra Burra Creek were destroyed, and the tenants unceremoniously expelled, but happily without loss of life. Thirty families were temporarily accommodated in the large building known as “Robin’s Stables”.’</p>
<p>Fry, the maniac murderer, was seen on Thursday in the scrub near his own station by some bullock drivers. He was nearly naked and carried a rifle, a brace of pistols and the long knife with which he killed the pony. Mr Harris, of Watervale and John* Humphrey, of the Burra Burra, have been in pursuit of him.</p>

<p>Floods. From our Kooringa correspondent:</p>
<p>‘The late heavy rains have caused an immense destruction of property among the huts excavated in the banks of the creek. Some months ago the Patent Copper Company made a roadway across the creek for the use of the carts carrying the ores from the mine to the smelting works. This roadway being raised several feet above the level of the creek formed a complete dam across the waterway, a very small channel being left for the water to flow through. On Thursday morning the creek assumed a very alarming appearance, and the channel through the roadway soon became choked. The water soon rose above the roofs of many of the huts, the inmates being glad to escape with their lives. Upwards of eighty huts were utterly destroyed, the furniture floating about in all directions. The water accumulated so quickly that in many instances large sums of money were forgotten to be removed. In one instance a man dived after his money, said to be upwards of £100, and succeeded in recovering it. It was a sad sight to see the women and children midst the heavy rain endeavouring to save their furniture from the flood which had destroyed their dwellings, and having no place to go for shelter. Many found shelter in the stables belonging to the “Smelters’ Home” public house, and in Messrs Thompson and Kekwick’s stores. The officers of the South Australian Mining Association rendered assistance to the unfortunate sufferers by sending carts belonging to the mine to assist in conveying such furniture as could be saved from the flood to a place of shelter, and as many families were admitted into the storehouses now being erected as could find room.</p>

<p>Samuel Stocks Jnr’s funeral took place yesterday. It was the most remarkable funeral seen in Adelaide since that of Colonel Light. The cavalcade left the residence of the deceased at 10 a.m., preceded by four mutes with wands and scarfs, a private carriage containing the Rev. J. Woodcock and three other gentlemen; the hearse containing the body in a coffin covered with rich black velvet, with gilt furniture, followed by forty carriages containing about 150 personal friends and attendants, in black silk scarfs and bands. The procession travelled via Hindley Street to King William Street and thence along North Terrace to the Cathedral Church. [Holy Trinity] The service was read by Rev. Dean Farrell, after which the procession proceeded to the West Terrace Cemetery.</p>

<p>Meteorological Observations at Kooringa.</p>
<p>For the month of January 1850 temperatures taken at 10 a.m., noon and 3 &amp; 4 p.m. are printed, together with barometric readings at 10 a.m. The readings were taken by Adie’s patent sympiesometer* at the Smelting Works at an elevation of 1,500 ft. The average of the temperature readings outlined above for the month was 76.66°F.</p>
<p>The article described the passage of a marked cold front on 28 January. Before the front the town experienced a sultry hot northwest wind. At the approach of the front there were enormous columns of dust in an immense whirlwind accompanied by thunder and lightning. Darkness, greater than that of a total eclipse descended on the town and then, after about a quarter of an hour the southerly wind prevailed and a refreshing shower of rain fell.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. William Lang, Coroner for the Murray District held an inquest on 13 February on the body of Patrick Riley. The deceased had been employed by Mr Birrell, brewer, of Kooringa. About six weeks ago he was reading in bed and fell asleep. The candle fell onto the bed and he was burned so severely that he ultimately succumbed to his injuries. Dr Bull said the burns were so extensive that he never had great hopes of recovery. The jury brought in a verdict of ‘Accidental Death’. [Patrick Riley died 13 February 1850 aged 30.]</p>

<p>Supreme Court of SA.</p>
<p>Addressing the Grand Jury with respect to the Gottlieb Keirnall case, His Honour said:</p>
<p>‘Presuming they (the Grand Jury) were satisfied of the manner by which the deceased came to his death, and on that point the evidence appeared conclusive, they would have to consider what motive the prisoner had for killing him. It would appear the deceased gave very great provocation. He threw stones and threatened or attempted to set fire to the prisoner’s house. It was for them (the Grand Jury) to consider how far the prisoner’s provocation would reduce the prisoner’s offence to manslaughter. To constitute the crime of murder malice aforethought was a necessary ingredient. At the same time, it was not a slight provocation that would so far justify the slaying of another as to reduce the crime to that of manslaughter. His Honour concluded his remarks, with reference to this case, by reminding the Grand Jury that he would have to address another jury more fully on the subject afterwards.</p>

<p>Supreme Court of SA, Adelaide, Wednesday 13 March.</p>
<p>Carl Gottlieb Keirnall, labourer of Kooringa, was indicted with the crime of wilful murder on the person of John Smith on 25 December at Kooringa. The offender was German and an interpreter was sworn.</p>
<p>Charles Augustus, a sailor, saw the deceased between 6 &amp; 7 p.m. at his own house. He was then in good health and sober. Saw his body at Wren’s Hotel at 11 p.m. There was a mark on the forehead, as if he had been struck.</p>
<p>Louisa Phillips said on Christmas Eve she was in the prisoner’s house. At about 10 p.m. a man came and asked for a light for his pipe. Witness gave him a light, but instead of lighting his pipe, he held it up to the roof. He had been drinking, but did not appear drunk. Witness asked him for the light and when he refused, she snatched at it and it rolled on the floor and went out. She bolted the door. A few minutes later there was a rap on the door and the man asked for a light, saying he would pay her for it. Witness refused. The man then burst open the door and threw a long stool, which struck the witness. He then flung a water bucket in pieces and some stones, one of which stuck the witness causing her to fall. Prisoner asked the man to leave, but the deceased said he would tear the liver out of him before he would go. He said he would pay some mischief with the house in five minutes. Prisoner asked her to find him a stick, but she could not do so. The man stood there aggravating for half an hour. The prisoner went out for about half a minute and then returned. She did not know he had done any harm. On his return he had an axe in his hand which had been used for cutting meat or wood. The axe was produced.</p>
<p>Cross-examined by Mr Parker, the witness said she had co-habited with the prisoner for two years. He resided in Light Square before he lived with her. She had lived in Kooringa with him for 10 months. The prisoner’s house had twice been broken into. On the night in question the prisoner was in bed and she had been about to retire, being undressed. Prisoner did not get out of bed until he had been threatened with mischief to the house. When he got up he told the man to go away and bolted the door. When she was struck she was pregnant. She believed the man was a total stranger to the prisoner. They lived in fear of annoyance, at the time.</p>
<p>His Honour sought clarification. Witness said a bundle of lime had been thrown through the window six weeks previously and a new house, the property of the prisoner, had been nearly pulled down.</p>
<p>[See SA Register 17 October 1849, page 3 where the reference is to Gottlieb Kearnall.]</p>
<p>Witness was about to be married to the prisoner.</p>
<p>Brierley Bailey aged 14, a miner’s son, said he saw the deceased ask for a light and then hold the candle up to the roof. Prisoner hit the man on the head with a stool and the deceased then threw the stool at the prisoner, followed by a cask and some stones. Prisoner again shut the door and the deceased burst it open again. Prisoner then came out with an axe and struck the deceased on the head. Deceased fell and never rose again. Witness told some men who sent for a doctor and one arrived in ten minutes. The fight lasted about half an hour and after the last blow the prisoner went in and closed the door.</p>
<p>Walter Bailey aged 12, brother of the previous witness, corroborated Brierley’s evidence.</p>
<p>William White, labourer, went to see the disturbance and the deceased came over to him, bleeding down his face. He picked up a cask, which had fallen to pieces, and threw it into the cottage. The prisoner went into the cottage and emerged after a couple of minutes with an axe. He struck the deceased on the forehead with the side of the axe and then gave a second violent blow to the head, after which the man fell dead. Ran for a doctor.</p>
<p>Daniel O’Leary, labourer, went to see what the row was about. Met deceased, who was more than half drunk, and who cried out ‘Are there any Englishmen amongst you?’ Deceased was bleeding from the face. Told him he had better go home. Deceased returned to the cottage and called out ‘Come out you cowardly vagabond, you’ve nearly murdered me already.’ Deceased then threw into the cottage an old bucket and some loose clay or stones. Prisoner came out, picked up a piece of wood, threw it down and went indoors, returning in about a minute and a half with an axe. Rhe deceased had his back to the prisoner, who first struck him with the pole of the axe, stunning him, and then felled him with the blade. Sent for a doctor and went into the house. Told the prisoner that he had killed the man. Prisoner said ‘No, but he’d hit him.’ Witness found the axe behind the door, stained with blood three inches deep. Told prisoner the man was dead. Witness took the axe home with him and placed it in a cask. Later he returned it and stuck it against the wall of the prisoner’s house. The police then took possession of it.</p>
<p>George Bull, surgeon, said he was called to the scene and found the deceased lying with his feet five or six feet from the cottage door. It was too dark to see much, but the deceased was pulseless and speechless. After a slight delay a light was obtained and deceased was sent to Wren’s Hotel. He was not quite dead, but died on the stretcher. He had slight wounds on the face and a wound on the crown of the head, which caused death. It must have been caused by a heavy cutting instrument such as the axe produced. The skull and the brain were completely separated. The other wounds might well have been caused by a stool flung at the deceased. If there had been a serious blow by the pole of the axe, he may not have discovered it.</p>
<p>Police sergeant Reed’s evidence was corroborative. He had not found the prisoner when he had searched for him that night.</p>
<p>The judge in summing up said that the jury should not be carried away by their feelings against the prisoner. It was the felonious, wilful and malicious character of the act that constituted the crime of murder. They might, on the evidence, return a verdict of murder, manslaughter, or even of common assault.</p>
<p>The jury retired for twenty minutes and returned a verdict of manslaughter.</p>
<p>Sentencing was deferred.</p>
<p>16 March 1850, page 3</p>
<p>Supreme Court of SA. 15 March.</p>
<p>Gottlieb Keirnall, convicted of the manslaughter of John Smith, was placed in the dock.</p>
<p>William Pohlman of the Hamburg Hotel in Rundle Street said he had known the prisoner for three and a half years. He had employed him for 15 months and was always satisfied with him. Herman Grutegut of the Adelaide Hotel in Hindley Street had known the prisoner for three and a half years and had found him civil and quiet.</p>
<p>The judge said that he was glad Keirnall had not been convicted of murder, but nevertheless it was a most aggravated case of manslaughter and despite the provocation there was no excuse for the use of the axe. Keirnall was sentenced to transportation beyond the seas for seven years.</p>
<p>25 March 1850, page 2</p>
<p>Review of the late Criminal Sittings</p>
<p>[After a list of the cases and some statistics of the types of offences before the court, the editor makes some comments on the sentencing of His honour Judge Cooper. The editor has no complaints about the judge’s decisions except in the case of Keirnall. He considers that Keirnall, though convicted of manslaughter, was virtually guilty of murder and ‘as a question of morals the man was an undoubted and brutal assassin. He contrasts Keirnall’s seven years transportation with the ten years awarded to another German youth called Disseldorf, ‘a mild tempered, talented, but foolish young man, who wickedly stole two horses, which were recovered by the owners, and who confessed his offence by pleading guilty.’ Surely Keirnall’s offence called for a more severe punishment than that inflicted on Disseldorf.]</p>

Bro. James Pollitt preached an appropriate sermon. Almost 100 sat down to dinner, provided by the new host at the Burra Burra Hotel. The Chair was held by Vice Grand Thompson.</p>

<p>Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 25 March.</p>
<p>Joseph Worth was charged with robbing John Folds. [At the later trial cited as John Foulds.]</p>
<p>William Bailey, general servant at the Smelters’ Home Hotel saw the prisoner drinking in the bar of the Smelters’ Home on Friday evening with the witness Tighe and the complainant. [At the trial Bailey is cited as Bayley.]</p>
<p>Sergeant John Reid said Tighe had come to the police station on Friday and reported that Worth had robbed Folds. Tighe’s face was much cut. He delivered up money orders amounting to £17-13-2, which he said he had taken from his pocket for safety. Reid went and arrested the prisoner who had what appeared to be recently washed cuts on his forehead.</p>
<p>Archibald Kirk was sitting in his hut on the banks of the creek on Friday night and said he saw the prisoner and the witness Tighe struggling together. Heard Tighe say the prisoner had been robbing him. Prisoner ran away, leaving his hat behind. The charge was denied. Worth was committed for trial.</p>
<p>Jane Hall alleged that Cherry Stevens had used abusive language towards her and called her a thief. The parties are neighbours in the creek. Stevens keeps chickens and having lost some eggs, he went to Hall and kicked up a row. The magistrate said the proper course would have been to apply to the court; he told Stevens that he had no right to go to Hall’s house and make a row. The defendant having apologised to Mrs Hall, the information was allowed to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>27 March.</p>
<p>Thomas Miller appeared to substantiate his right to a bullock claimed by Albert Meurant. It appeared that about a year ago Meurant bought the bullock and soon after lost it. A few days ago he saw the bullock in Miller’s team. Miller proved he bought the bullock from J.F. Angas at Flaxman Valley at about the time Meurant lost it. His Worship ordered the bullock be returned to Meurant.</p>

<p>An Artful Dodge at Port Henry [i.e. Port Wakefield]</p>
<p>Someone has persuaded the Lieutenant-Governor to put up for 14-year lease a 143⁄4 acre site at the new shipping place at the head of the Gulf St Vincent. A petition against this has been sent to him, urging the immediate withdrawal of this offer because the purchaser of the lease would be able to monopolise the whole of the carriage from the Burra Mine; al traffic having to pass through such lease. The memorialists request instead that the land be made available for sale in one-acre lots, and that certain reserves be included for the security of the public.</p>
<p>[Greater details in outlining the borders and position of the block in question are given. The editor does not doubt that the Lieutenant-Governor will accede to this request in the interests of competition and the public good and endorses the call for the sale of the land in one or one-half acre allotments.]</p>
<p>The natural advantages of the locality may be estimated from the fact that Mr Buck’s 100-ton barge is placed so that drays may come alongside and load or discharge as the case may be. Viewed in connection with neighbouring mineral lands and pasturages, the natural harbour of Port Henry is a very important feature.</p>

At 5 p.m. 300 friends of the institution took tea in the chapel, after which John Boots presided at a public meeting, in the unavoidable absence of the Rev. Lowe. Several addresses on the importance of the institution’s work were delivered and on the role of Sunday schools in general. The event resulted in taking £33-0-0; £11-7-6 from the sale of tickets and £21-12-6 from subscriptions. It is about three years since the school was established and it now has c. 280 pupils and 40 teachers.</p>

<p>Government Land Sale</p>
<p>[The editorial condemns the decision of Governor Robe to refuse a Special Survey of 20,000 acres on Emu Flats. This would have yielded £20,000 for the Government. As a consequence the land was subdivided and just the best sections sold for perhaps £5,257-11-0. Yesterday 7,472 acres were sold for £9,996-9-0. This leaves thousands of acres unappropriated, which must have been included in a special survey.]</p>

<p>Recent Government Land Sale</p>
<p>There were four buyers or associations of buyers for the recent sale of mineral lands:</p>
<p>South Australian Mining Association</p>
<p>Emu Plains Association</p>
<p>Royal Mining Company</p>
<p>A private party for whom Mr Hector acted as agent</p>
<p>Before bidding started the first three named came to an arrangement. This gave the SA Mining Association first choice and then the next two amalgamated under the name of the Royal Mining Co. It is not expected that the SA Mining Association will immediately begin any serious operations on its acquisitions at the Emu Plains, but the Royal Mining Co. is expected to begin vigorous operations on its lands. There is every reason to believe that the mineral wealth of this district will be abundantly realised.</p>

<p>Port Wakefield</p>
<p>Last week’s Government Gazette contains documents relating to what was lately called Port Henry, in compliment to Sir Henry Young, but which is now to be named Port Wakefield. It compliments the gentleman upon whose system of colonisation South Australia was established. Following the withdrawal of the proposed lease, a township will be laid out on Section 2130, with the allotments sold in the usual way. Leases of the corresponding water frontages will be offered to public competition for terms of 14 years. Lessees will be bound to leave in front of them a breadth of water of not less than 50 ft, assuring access and egress to the upper frontages.</p>
<p>Advertisement. Township of Wakefield. Near Port Wakefield at the head of St Vincent’s Gulf. Plan No. 450.</p>
<p>Lots number from 1 to 127. Sections 16 to 146 (except 30, 62, 79, 97 &amp; 114) each section is 2 roods, at the price per lot of £5. Ten lots of water frontages of about 420 ft, each of 1 acre are offered at the upset price of £10 for a 14 year lease and subject to a peppercorn rent. (Lots 1, 2 &amp; 3 are c. 1 acre and the others are 1 acre less the breadth of a road.) Charles Sturt, Colonial Secretary.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association held its half-yearly general meeting yesterday. The Directors’ qualification was reduced from 20 shares to 11. Charles Beck, having decided for the present to forego his intended trip to England, was re-elected Chairman of the Board of Directors. The two new members of the Board are Mr Thomas Waterhouse and Mr Saunders. On the whole the report is the most gratifying yet. The prospects are that the next half-yearly report will be still more satisfactory. The last £5 share to change hands did so at £158 cash.</p>
<p>Two hundred additional miners might most profitably be employed at the Burra Burra Mine. This fact may account for the rumour that the SA Mining Association would postpone any developments at their newly acquired property at Emu Plains.</p>
<p>19 April 1850, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>[Editorial]</p>
<p>The 5th Annual General Meeting of the Association was held and the Report of the Directors was presented.</p>
<p>Dividends already paid amount to £172,480 and the Directors seem perfectly warranted in promising two other payments of 200% in June and September. There is no reason why this present prosperous state of affairs will not continue.</p>
<p>‘We venture to say there never ought to have been any serious interruption in that prosperous tide of affairs, which has so happily influenced the general progress of the colony.’</p>
<p>We allude, of course, to the ill-advised reductions in wages made some time ago and to which the Association mat attribute the removal of much useful labour from their own mineral lands and the departure of many skilful and intelligent miners to California.</p>
<p>The description of Kingston’s North Lode is sufficient to convince that almost any number of miners might be employed with a large profit in a concern of such vast productiveness:</p>
<p>‘&hellip;at the thirty fathom level we have extended this level north twenty fathoms, fifteen of which we have driven through a magnificent lode; eight fathoms wide, producing malachite, red oxide, and native copper ore, varying from forty-six to sixty per cent.’ The pitches in the back of the thirty fathom level, south of Kingston’s Shaft, are turning out beyond expectation; from one pitch “the pair” (takers) broke out last month one hundred and fifty tons of ore, of forty-four per cent.’</p>
<p>On the day before the date of the report a heap of ore was sampled which gave 703⁄8%.</p>
<p>There are already divisible profits to the extent of £64,000 and upwards to meet the two promised dividends of £24,640 each.</p>
<p>20 April 1850, page 3</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>The following statistics show the past activity at the Mine from its inception on 29 September 1845.</p>
<p>The capital originally subscribed by shareholders was only £12,320.</p>
<p>The following dividends have been paid:</p>
<p>Grand Total Dividends in 41⁄2 years £172,480</p>
<p>After allowing for all liabilities there remains on hand a clear balance of divisible profits in excess of £64,000, or between 500 &amp; 600% on the capital.</p>
<p>[The article then compares the Burra Burra Mine with the best mines in Devon and Cornwall and concludes that:</p>
<p>‘The average success of the Burra Burra is nine to one in excess of the average of the great English Mines.’</p>
<p>The writer does, however, conclude that a comparison of share prices suggests that Burra Burra shares are greatly overpriced, or else the prices in England are greatly depressed.</p>
<p>He goes on to suggest some errors in the management of the Burra Burra. The poor wages paid to Cornish miners in SA have resulted in many deciding to move to California, while others have taken employment in the agricultural and pastoral industries. Employment might be found for many more miners at the Burra Burra if the Directors paid more liberal and enlightened wages.]</p>
<p>The engine at the Burra Burra Mine, of which so much has been made, is only of some 80 horse-power. This will be quite insufficient as the mine goes deeper. Many engines at abandoned mines in Cornwall are of 150-250 horse-power and could have been obtained for £500-£1,000 each. For instance the engine at the Hallenbeagle had a 70 inch cylinder and 200 horse-power and was for sale in 1848 for £600. It was in good condition and cost £2,200 when new. ‘The local board seem bent upon pursuing a narrow-minded, grudging economy in the payment of their servants, and exhibit a determination to be regular grasp-alls of every mineral acre worth working&hellip;than to conduct a great public undertaking in a manner worthy of the age and the land we live in.’</p>
<p>20 April 1850, page 4</p>
<p>‘Mallachite’ [sic] writes from the Burra Burra Mines, 15 April.</p>
<p>[This letter is addressed to the Directors of the SA Mining Association and begins in bitter irony: ‘Knowing that you at all times take a lively interest in the welfare of the labouring portion of the community’.</p>
<p>The writer says the miners at first obtained good wages and were able to set aside something for a rainy day. But, then wages were cut by a management that was penny wise and pound foolish. The miners became discouraged and their energies were dampened, to the disadvantage of all, including the mine proprietors. Now the company is offering free passage to Cornish miners. With local miners not earning survival wages, is it becoming to multiply the numbers of ill-paid and discontented men? To add to their hardships the company has ordered those with home on the mine site (erected with the company’s permission) to now move into Kooringa – giving them a two mile walk home and back id they wish to dine. By thus pointing out the ‘rocks and shoals on which he [the immigrant] (if he venture here) will inevitably suffer shipwreck’ the writer hopes to prevent the ‘unnecessary influx of emigrants’.</p>

<p>Immigration Agent’s Report</p>
<p>Charles P. Brewer, Immigration Agent. Immigration Office, Port Adelaide, 14 April 1850.</p>
<p>Three emigrant ships have arrived this quarter with 722 emigrants, being about half the number sent in each quarter of the previous 18 months. Supply has, however, met demand except for miners, mine labourers and female domestic servants.</p>
<p>The Secretary of the SA Mining Association [Henry Ayers] has written, stating that the supply of mining labour is very deficient and they could immediately employ 100-150 more miners. I believe if 200 miners arrived immediately they would find ready employment without affecting wages.</p>
<p>Only one case of misconduct is reported from the Government ships; the third mate on the Agincourt was found one night to have concealed himself in the single women’s apartment, for which he forfeited his gratuity.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of sickness on the Trafalgar. Hooping cough was brought on board by a child and there was also much diarrhoea. Seven children died of hooping cough and eleven other persons from disease, mainly fever.</p>
<p>23 were ill or convalescent on arrival and two subsequently died.</p>
<p>15 other passenger ships have also arrived. The vast majority of the passengers were satisfied with their treatment during the journey. However, on the Douglas and the Bolivar large quantities of spirits were sold to passengers, causing much drunkenness and misconduct.</p>
<p>The captain of the Douglas was fined £5 and of the Bolivar £20 for breeching Clause 42 of the Passengers’ Act. The captain of the Brothers was also fined £5 for a similar offence. Some of the surgeons on passenger ships are quite unsuitable, being in some cases habitual drunkards and in others madmen.</p>
<p>The Passengers’ Act provides no redress in such cases.</p>
<p>There has been an immigration of 377 persons from Germany, but 588 persons have sailed for California this quarter and several vessels are now laid on for that country.</p>
<p>For the Quarter ended 31 March 1850:</p>
<p>Emigrant vessels arrived 3</p>
<p>Deaths on board or in quarantine 22</p>
<p>Births on board or in quarantine 14</p>

<p>Criminal Sessions</p>
<p>Joseph Worth was charged with stealing 15/- from John Foulds at Kooringa on 22 March.</p>
<p>Foulds said he was with his friend William Tighe at the Smelters’ Home Hotel on 26 February. Foulds said he ‘grew stupid’ and left to lie down near his dray. Tighe lay down nearby. Foulds had 15/- in cash and c. £17 in cheques in his pockets. He awoke in the night hearing someone say he was robbed. He felt in his pocket and found his money was gone, but he felt so sick that he went to sleep again. In the morning Tighe had told him he had taken the cheques and placed them at the police station for safe keeping. He did not think Tighe had been drunk on leaving the hotel.</p>
<p>William Tighe (a pork butcher) confirmed Foulds’ evidence and added that he had seen the prisoner take the money from Foulds’ pocket. He had tackled Worth who had either kicked him or struck him with a stick, cutting his forehead. Worth had then run away. Tighe followed and they fought, but knowing Foulds had cheques in his pocket, Tighe had returned to secure the money. He had seen Foulds receive the £17-12-2 from the Patent Copper Co. that evening. Tighe had been about 18 months in SA, having come from Sydney.</p>
<p>William Bayley, waiter at the Smelters’ Home also offered corroborative evidence.</p>
<p>Archibald Kirk was employed with Worth at the Patent Copper Co. He confirmed the evidence concerning the struggle between Tighe and Worth.</p>
<p>Acting Sergeant Reid corroborated Tighe’s evidence about handing over the cheques and also gave evidence about Worth’s arrest.</p>
<p>The jury found the accused guilty.</p>
<p>George Chadwick gave Worth a good character reference.</p>
<p>Because it was a first offence the Judge gave him three months’ hard labour.</p>

<p>When it became known that water frontages were being reserved at the township of [Port] Wakefield, intending purchasers petitioned that the whole of the land for sale be withdrawn ‘to prevent the undue value such partial sale would give to the sections withheld. The petition was signed by John Hart for the Patent Copper Co., P.J. Tod, George Elder, Henry Mildred, G.M. Waterhouse and Emanuel Solomon. As a consequence the sale of the Wakefield allotments and river frontages was postponed to this day at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Oddfellows Lodge with upwards of 200 members is trying to establish a library to fulfil a need in Kooringa. The library will operate in connection with the lodge, but will be open to the public upon payment of an increased subscription. It is surprising that a town of 5,000 people does not have this means of intellectual amusement. It is to be hoped that as well as a library, a savings bank will soon be established there, as there can be no doubt that with a bank much money now squandered in waste and extravagance would be saved.</p>

They expect to be away about eight days to examine the property and lay out a township. The mine is spoken of very highly by parties reaching Adelaide last Tuesday. Surface samples brought back were assayed at 271⁄2% and samples from two feet underground assayed at 421⁄2%.</p>

<p>The Mania Murderer, Fry.</p>
<p>The mystery of the disappearance of the maniac Fry has been solved by the discovery of his bones by Mr Alexander McCulloch, within half a mile of where he murdered his wife and not more than four miles from his station. Although wild dogs had torn his clothes and scattered the bones, he was identified from his rifle, cutting knife, pistol and pocket book. His wife’s bonnet was also nearby. It is expected an inquest will be held on Thursday. This will allow letters of administration to be granted, to the benefit of his children. It is rumoured that the contents of the pocket-book are of a highly important and interesting nature.</p>

<p>‘W.W.’ writes concerning the lands of the Royal Mining Co. He urges people not to be misled by reports purposely got up to mislead them and not to sell their shares in this company, for which he asserts ‘no mine in the world can be looking better than the one in question, and the public can rest assured that the unfavourable report has been got up to mislead the credulous, and with a decided view to reap a great harvest themselves.’</p>
<p>9 July 1850, page 3</p>
<p>The Royal Mining Co. at Emu Flats</p>
<p>[After a long and flowery introduction it eventually becomes apparent that the company’s directors visited their Emu Flats mineral lands and the result of their visit was a collapse in the share price from £4 or £5 to 30/- in just two days.]</p>
<p>It seems that the panic was started by one of the Directors, who, having stated there were upwards of 100 tons or ore on the surface, found on his visit that this was not so, and panicked. No practical man present made the assertion and the Director is merely reacting to not finding the castles in the air that his own unassisted imagination created. We are assured that many promising lodes lie on the property. The editor, however, warns that mining shares should always be bought with surplus income and not with the expectation of being able to sell the next day at a huge profit. Such a buyer is ‘a mere angler for gain, and ought not to be surprised if, instead of a gudgeon, he occasionally hooks a disappointment.’</p>
<p>[The image seems a bit odd, given that a gudgeon is a small freshwater fish.]</p>
<p>Inquest. The result of the inquest upon the remains of the ill-fated Fry is a verdict of ‘Found dead.’ The neckerchief found around the skeleton’s neck was stained with blood and it is therefore supposed that he cut his own throat. The pocket-book supplies proof that he was illiterate and at the time of writing in it was suffering under a mental aberration. It is clear now that Sergeant-Major McCulloch’s opinions were correct as to the fate of Fry, despite plausible statements made by correspondents in all the respectable papers.</p>

<p>J.S. Barnett alleged that J.R. Mortlock, landlord of the Burra Burra Hotel, had illegally detained four money order totalling 30/-. Barnett had sent the orders to the hotel to be cashed, but Mortlock had used part of the sum to pay an outstanding bill of Barnett’s at the hotel and returned only the difference. His worship recommended the orders be returned as the defendant had no right to pay himself, but could recover the account through the court if it was not paid.</p>
<p>Tristram Bath, superintendent of the Princess Royal Mines alleged that William Barrett had illegally removed wood from the company’s land. Barrett did not appear and a warrant was issued for his apprehension.</p>
<p>Robert Nettle said he had seen the accused load at least half a load on the company’s land on 8 July. The load was brought into Burra. The defendant, having nothing to say in his defence was ordered to pay 10/-, being the value of the wood and also fined 20/- with 27/- costs.</p>

<p>Mr Clare claimed £4-19-6 was due to his son as wages from Mr Hoiles, for whom the boy had been working in his house on the Gulf Road. Septimus Boord gave evidence that he was paying a boy of about the same age 5/- per week plus his board. His Worship said the problem would not have arisen had the parties made a proper agreement. The verdict was for the complainant for the amount claimed with each side to bear his own costs.</p>
<p>Rev. James Pollitt charged that John S. Maling, carpenter, had attempted to remove some shingles, the property of the complainant and also with an assault.</p>
<p>The defendant had contracted to do some work on the parsonage at Redruth, but had then refused to go on with the contract. On Monday he had attempted to remove some bundles of shingles that had not been used. He refused to desist when asked and had forced the bindle against Pollitt’s knuckles, removing some skin. Pollitt’s servant had come out and Maling then went away.</p>
<p>James Edward Woodforde corroborated the above and said the defendant also was very abusive.</p>
<p>John Seymore corroborated the evidence of the preceding witness.</p>
<p>Defendant claimed the shingles were his property; part of 16,000 for which he had paid.</p>
<p>Complainant said he could produce the bill to satisfy His Worship they were his.</p>
<p>His Worship said ownership of the shingles was something he could not decide. Even admitting the shingles were the property of defendant that did not give him the right to remove them by force. He should have summonsed the complainant to show cause why he detained them.</p>
<p>For the assault Maling was fined 10/- with 25/- costs.</p>
<p>James Trebilcock alleged that Owen Donahoo [sic] had abused him the previous Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Defendant pleaded guilty and promised to give up intoxicating drink for 12 months if His Worship would allow the charge to be withdrawn. Allowed, upon the payment of costs.</p>
<p>John Sullivan charged Philip Longmead with detaining a quantity of wood. The case, which had been before the case several times and adjourned for witnesses, was concluded after hearing much conflicting evidence. His worship ordered the defendant to pay 10/- for the value of the wood and for each party to pay his own costs.</p>

<p>The Lady Denison</p>
<p>At last we have some real evidence of the fate of this missing barque. At Emu Bay a sealer has told Captain Duncan of the Lapwing that about a month earlier he had seen, bottom up and on shore a longboat marked Lady Denison. This was on the ‘Church Rock’ on the west coast of Van Diemen’s Land. Clothing and other items of the ship were scattered along the shore. There is therefore no reason to doubt that the ship met her fate in one of the gales which were noticed after her departure from here. It is barely possible that some crew or passengers may have survived, but we fear there is very little ground for hope.</p>
<p>[This was the vessel that was carrying Gottlieb Keirnall, the German convicted of the manslaughter of John Smith, to serve his sentence in Tasmania. It is possible that the ship did not sink and this is discussed in Pike, Douglas 1967, Paradise of Dissent, 2nd Edition, Melbourne University Press, Melbourne, page 295.</p>
<p>‘Two years later rumours reached Adelaide that the ship had not foundered at all; she had been sighted near Hobart and seen to alter course suddenly and steer away from land. A German from Melbourne had been heard to state that he had received a letter from a fellow countryman among the prisoners. In Adelaide it was recalled that certain low friends of the prisoners had boasted soon after the ship had sailed that an attempt would be made to capture her. Finally a man named Byett, arrested on the Ovens goldfield on suspicion of murder, was recognised by an ex-Adelaide policeman as one of the Lady Denison prisoners. As it reached Adelaide, Byett’s story was that the prisoners on the vessel had risen upon the constables and thrown them and the captain overboard; the passengers’ lives were spared and they had been landed upon some island; the Lady Denison had sailed to California where the prisoners quickly lost themselves amongst the diggers. Lack of co-operation between the neighbouring police forces prevented a final solution of the mystery.</p>

Defendant agreed to pay the doctor’s bill and to compensate the complainant for his time and the matter was allowed to stand over.</p>
<p>Lawn sued Smith for 9/8 for two days’ wages. He had been hired for a week, but refused to continue after two days, as he had received a better paying offer. His worship dismissed the case and said if Smith lodged a complaint for breach of contract, Lawn could expect to be punished.</p>
<p>Middleton sued Carter for £4-19-0 for board and lodgings, but after conflicting evidence and an unreadable rent book His Worship dismissed the case with the defendant to pay costs because he had not taken receipts for his payments.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. On Saturday 10 August a man named Leter [sic: for Lester] left the Smelting Co. with a dray loaded with about two tons of copper bound for the Gulf. Having imprudently decided to ride on the pole, he somehow fell off and the wheel of the dray passed over his chest, killing him instantly. Mr Robinson of Hill River carried the news to the authorities in Burra Burra and the deceased was taken to the Burra Burra Hotel, where an inquest was held on Monday.</p>
<p>Obituary. Mr Frederick Lester aged 37 died on Saturday 10 August at the Burra Burra Mines. He was the son of the late James Lester, solicitor of Ashford, Kent. He met his death while accompanying his dray. He was one of the oldest colonists and his death was deeply lamented by all who knew him. He is survived by a wife and four young children. [Name, date and aged details are confirmed by SA Deaths CD.]</p>
<p>Accident. On Saturday 10 August the mail driver arrived at Kooringa and while he was adjusting the harness the horses started. He held on as long as possible, but eventually stumbled and fell; the wheel of the cart passing over him. He sustained severe internal injuries and a broken rib.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. The inquest before W. Lang on the body of Frederick Lester is reported.</p>
<p>It was held at the Burra Burra Hotel on 12 August.</p>
<p>Samuel Pearce aged 14 was employed by the deceased to drive one of his teams. Deceased and he had started from the Smelting Works with two drays of copper to take to Port Wakefield. Deceased had complained of feeling giddy and had leaned his head against the fore part of the dray as it was going along. Witness was driving the first team and, finding the dray driven by the deceased had stopped, he went back and saw Lester lying face down on the ground. There was a wheel mark across his back. He was quite dead. Two men on horseback came along and rode into Burra, which was about three miles away. Deceased had often complained of dizziness to Pearce. He was not intoxicated, but a very sober man. He had drunk no spirits and took none with him.</p>
<p>John Coles, Northern Districts Ranger, had come upon the accident and took the news to the police barracks.</p>
<p>William Parr Hill said he was requested by the brother of the deceased to examine the body. He found contusions and broken ribs, which had undoubtedly punctured the lungs. The passage of a wheel of a dray carrying two tons of copper was sufficient to cause death. The verdict was ‘Accidental Death’.</p>
<p>Herbert Lester, the deceased’s brother was dissatisfied with his brother’s body being placed in an outhouse and not in the hotel. Mr Mortlock [of the Burra Burra Hotel] said the hotel was full and he had given all the accommodation in his power. [Frederick Lester died 10 August 1850 aged 37.]</p>
<p>The jury expressed great dissatisfaction that, under the new Act, 24 tradesmen had to be called from their business to attend this inquest.</p>

<p>The residents of Burra Burra, in anticipation of the advantages likely to flow from the forthcoming enlargement of the Legislative Council, have sent a requisition to the Resident Magistrate to call a public meeting ‘to consider what steps should be taken in order to secure an efficient representation of these townships in the new Council’.</p>

<p>Local Court, Kooringa, 13 August.</p>
<p>Owen Donahoo [sic] charged Jeremiah Hurley with assault. Donahoo said that on Sunday evening the defendant and his wife brought a bottle of grog to his hut and when he refused to drink with them Hurley began beating him and threatened to stick a knife in him. He had to send for the police because Hurley had taken over the hut.</p>
<p>Hurley said he had purchased the hut from the complainant for £4-10-0.</p>
<p>Alexander Daly gave evidence that he had seen Hurley pay £4-10-0 to Donahoo for the hut. They had all been drinking together and Daley had seen no row.</p>
<p>Donahoo said loudly that Daly was perjuring himself and Donahoo had no money for food and could not have bought the hut. The Donahoos had been living at the complainant’s expense.</p>
<p>Case adjourned for some better evidence to be collected.</p>
<p>14 August</p>
<p>John Grennin charged Benjamin Spargo with shooting a dog. Grennin said the act was pure mischief and he valued the dog at £4. Spargo said the dog, with others, had been chasing his cows. His Worship said Grennin should have summoned the owner of the dog, but had no right to shoot it. Spargo offered to pay £1 compensation for the dog and Grennin accepted the offer. Spargo to pay costs of 16/-.</p>
<p>Adjourned case of Donahoo v. Hurley</p>
<p>Mary Locke gave evidence showing that the Hurleys had no money.</p>
<p>Edward Fitzgerald had heard Daly talking to Donahoo after the previous hearing. He heard Daly say to Donahoo that the evidence he gave was not correct and that he knew nothing of the matter.</p>
<p>His Worship ruled that the case was evidently an attempt to do the complainant out of his hut. Hurley was fined 5/- with costs of £1-12-0.</p>
<p>Alexander Daly pleaded guilty to assaulting Donahoo and was fined 5/- with 19/- costs.</p>
<p>17 August</p>
<p>Patience Thomas charged William Bray with owning a dog that had attacked her and torn her shawl. Bray had compensated her and on payment of 16/- costs the information was allowed to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>A case brought by The SA Mining Co. against James Roscrow of taking timber from their property was dismissed as a consequence of an error in the day named on which the offence was alleged committed.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Contribution to the Exhibition of All Nations in London in 1851</p>
<p>Yesterday and on Tuesday the Directors of the SA Mining Association arranged for a display in the Directors’ Board Room of the specimens of copper ore and metallic copper, which they are sending to London for the Exhibition next year. Visitors to this display have included the Governor and Lady Young, the Lord Bishop and the elite of SA society. There were about a thousand other visitors ranging from those attired in fashionable dress to those in the more homely attire of the rural interior. All were granted free admission and polite courtesy by Mr Ayers, the company secretary and Mr Phillips, who took special charge of the display.</p>
<p>On entering we saw the various curious and magnificent specimens and heaps of native copper, but our notice was especially drawn to a large lump of ore displayed in an upturned case and of a quality likely to yield 45% copper metal. It weighed, we think, not less than 8 cwt and came from the 30 fathom level of one of the lodes. There was also a smaller, but even richer specimen from the same lode at the 40 fathom level. The monster lode itself is said to have a breadth of 15 fathoms within two well defined ‘walls’; the lode holding good above the 30 fathom and below the 40 fathom. It is said that were it practicable or desirable to do so a twenty or even 50 ton lump might be obtained in one piece. Ores exceeding £18 in average value are now being delivered to the Association at a total cost for mining and raising of not more than 18/- per ton. After hearing this we may not be so amazed at the marvellous dividends of 200% per quarter.</p>
<p>Among the brilliant specimens of red oxide, malachite, green carbonate, virgin copper and copper in a merchantable state, we must not forget to laud the first fruits of the Association’s new mine at Karkulto (the section at Emu Springs), purchased at the last Government Land Sale for something above £10,000.</p>
<p>The eight bags of admirable samples of SA wheat, barley and oats, and the SA Company’s case of olive oil, all prepared for the Exhibition of All Nations, were also examined by the visitors.</p>
<p>‘England, if properly instructed as to the vast capabilities of these colonies, cannot fail to view them with feelings of pride and exultation as valuable portions of the British Empire.’</p>

<p>Mr W.S. Chauncy’s Report on the Survey of the Northern Railway to the SA Railway Committee.</p>
<p>Report on a line of railway from Port Adelaide to the Burra.</p>
<p>The beginning was surveyed with a view to connection with a railway from Adelaide to the Port and with a connection to the North Arm. The line from Port Adelaide to the city as proposed would be 254 yards shorter than any previous proposal, but would involve acquiring 32 acres of private land, which at an average cost of £10 per acre amounts to £320 – a sum more than covered by the savings in the length of the route.</p>
<p>The distance from the Port to Gawler is 221⁄4 miles and would be 27 miles from Adelaide by the same route. One bridge costing c. £500 would be needed.</p>
<p>From Gawler northwards the line would encounter the necessity of crossing a high ridge. An attempt to avoid this by going a little further west certainly found easier gradients, but was frustrated by the need to descend some 400 feet to the River Light.</p>
<p>For these reason I determined on a survey through level country westward of the present roads, beginning from a point about 5 miles south of Gawler and travelling thence north-westerly.</p>
<p>Some have suggested horse power, but this has already been addressed in a paper published by me and dismissed as impracticable.</p>
<p>The proposed main line crosses the Gawler River about 6 miles below the town and continues in the same direction until it passes through the southwest point of the large scrub on the north side of the Gawler. It then adopts a northerly direction. It crosses the River Light near a place known as Red Banks and about 12 miles below the junction of the Light with the Gilbert. The bridges over the Gawler and Light Rivers would each cost c. £1,000.</p>
<p>The distance from Port Adelaide to the Light is 33 miles and thence to the Wakefield is 20 miles. The whole of this distance will require almost no cuttings or embankments and for 40 miles travels through Crown Lands. The soil is good, but some 8 miles of scrub will have to be negotiated. The want of water is a problem, but wells would be dug at convenient intervals to serve this purpose. The Wakefield is crossed some 20 miles from the head of the gulf. The bridge here would be more expensive. From there the line crosses 5 miles of scrub and several sand ridges, which would require two cuttings 30 feet deep (which would be preferable to the alternative length of curves to avoid the cuttings). After the scrub there is a plain for 16 miles to the Emu Mines. All this area is fit for the plough and would surely be taken up if the railway were built.</p>
<p>I propose at present to terminate the line at 10 miles beyond the Wakefield, 70 miles from Adelaide, 10 miles from the Emu Mines and 30 miles from Burra. To continue to Burra would necessitate more expenditure on cuttings and other earthworks than the likely traffic would justify.</p>
<p>The result of the survey is very favourable for the construction of the line and the cost of construction would suggest that the line could carry ores and other heavy goods at the rate of 21⁄2d to 3d per ton per mile. Also more than 200,000 acres of land would be thrown open to the public, the sale of which would enable the Government to provide a supply of labour for carrying out the undertaking without fear of affecting the labour market.</p>
<p>No doubt British capital could be obtained for such a venture; especially with a Government guarantee of 5% for 21 years.</p>
<p>3 September 1850, page 2</p>
<p>F.H. Burslem, Surveyor of Morphett Street, Adelaide, 2 September, writes on the Northern Districts.</p>
<p>[Burslem begins by saying he was retained by the SA Mining Association to investigate a possible railway route to the Burra Burra Mine, while taking into account the desirability of opening as much land to public competition as was possible and also considering the best route to facilitate branch lines to other mines etc. along the way. As a consequence of this experience, he disagrees strongly with Mr Chauncey’s proposal, at least as deduced from his description; a viewing of the plans not as yet being possible.]</p>
<p>Chauncey’s route goes too far west of Gawler. He had also better crossed near the junction of the Light and the Gilbert and then to the Gilbert up the valley and over a low saddle to the Wakefield, and then over another low rise to the endless flat. This line offers no engineering difficulties at any point and throws open a great deal more available land than his proposed route.</p>
<p>It is a matter of surprise that he stops short of Kooringa. The impression generally was that the line would run to Kooringa, it being generally acknowledged that no line would pay without the traffic to and from that neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Mining Gazette of 31 August confirms my views, though the writer there has not discussed the line proposed by Mr Chauncey. All those to whom I have spoken on the subject agree.</p>
<p>[Burslem also dismisses the likelihood that artesian wells will supply the needed water along the route.]</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel on Thursday 29 August on the body of Joseph Byce, who had been killed while working at the Burra Burra Mines on the previous day. W. Lang Esq. was the coroner. Deceased had been employed to fill up some of the exhausted workings of the mine. This was being done from a hole on the surface. Deceased had incautiously got on top of the heap of loose rubble, which had sunk down with him, burying him. On being recovered from the 20 fathom level he was quite dead. Dr Chambers had been sent for and arrived before the recovery of the body. He found the deceased had been suffocated, there being dirt in his mouth that prevented his breathing. Several witnesses were examined and they said it was usual for exhausted workings to be filled in this way and that no blame attached to anyone except the deceased.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>
<p>[Joseph Byce died 28 August 1850 aged 24.]</p>

<p>Local Court, Kooringa, 26 August.</p>
<p>John S. Malling charged William Nicholson with unlawfully carrying away carpenter’s tools from his house while Malling was in Adelaide. He had taken them to Penwortham and used them to work on Rev. Bagshaw’s house.</p>
<p>Nicholson said the complainant’s wife had given him the tools; which she denied.</p>
<p>Nicholson said Malling owed him more than £20 in wages and this complaint was taken out of spite. He had brought the tools and was ready to return them.</p>
<p>His Worship considered the charge made out and in consideration of the return of the tools imposed a fine of 1/- with 28/- costs.</p>
<p>John P. Winchcombe charged David Ballard with assaulting him. On 29 July the defendant came to Winchcombe at Apoinga with a whip in hand and asked him why he had stated untruths about him in the newspapers. When Winchcombe refused to fight him, Ballard struck him two or three blows before someone intervened and took him away.</p>
<p>Ballard said he had been provoked by lies put into the paper by Winchcombe about him in connexion with a drunken woman who was in court in Kooringa a few days previously.</p>
<p>His Worship said that such might be pleaded in mitigation; it did not excuse the assault. After reading the newspaper account His Worship said he could not see anything to provoke the assault. He imposed a fine of 20/- plus 27/- costs.</p>
<p>John P. Winchcombe charged Joseph Jones with taking away a bridle.</p>
<p>The evidence reveals a rather trivial matter and Jones was fined 5/- with 27/- costs.</p>

<p>Port Wakefield is rapidly assuming an imposing appearance. Public houses, stores and dwellings are springing up, as if by magic, it being the highway to the Burra Burra and other mines. Vessels of the largest tonnage can discharge within three miles of the township with safety, by means of barges, which find convenient places for unloading within smooth water at all times.</p>

<p>The New Congregational Chapel at Kooringa was opened on Sunday 29 September. It cost nearly £300. Rev. T. Q. Stow of the Congregational Church in Adelaide preached in the morning and evening. Rev. Mr Lowe, the Kooringa Wesleyan minister preached in the afternoon. A tea-party and a public meeting were held on Monday evening. W. Giles, the manager of the SA Company, presided at the latter. Collections and contributions amounted to £40. The building can accommodate 200. The debt on the building is only c. £30.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel on Monday 30 September on the body of Martin Trebilcock, who was accidentally killed while working underground at the Burra Burra Mine. William Lang, the Resident Magistrate, was the coroner.</p>
<p>His mate, who was working with the deceased, said that on Saturday afternoon they were working together with Trebilcock being in front, when some other miners gave the alarm that the ground was cracking. Before the deceased could get out of the way a mass of ore fell from overhead, striking him on the back and almost burying him. The ground had been propped that morning and every precaution seems to have been taken. Deceased was taken out insensible and carried home. Doctors Chambers and Bull attended. The whole of the ribs on the right side were broken and he had severe spinal injuries. The ribs had penetrated the lungs and Trebilcock died about an hour later. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death. Deceased was a respectable young man of about 24 and leaves a widow and one child. He was a member of the Manchester Unity IOOF and was attended to the grave by members of the Burra Burra Lodge. [Martin Trebilcock died 28 September 1850 aged 24.]</p>

<p>SA Mining Association has held its half-yearly meeting. The report of the Directors was extremely gratifying. Despite having spent more than £13,000 in acquiring and starting the new mine of Karkulto at the Emu Plains, there has been no interruption in the quarterly dividend of 200%. Mr Frederick John Beck was elected to the Directorship vacated by his brother on the latter’s departure for England. Captain Allen was chosen as the new Chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>18 October 1850, page 2</p>
<p>Half-yearly meeting of the SA Mining Association (Editorial)</p>
<p>[Before writing about the half-yearly meeting, the editor gave an over-view of operations since 1845.]</p>
<p>Operations at Burra Burra began on 29 September 1845 with a paid up capital of £12,320 and although £10,257-6-2 was expended in purchasing the inestimable territory known as the Burra Burra, the mining operations were so successful that it has not been necessary to make any subsequent call. The distance of the European markets has proved to be no financial hindrance where products were so rich and remunerative.</p>
<p>The prospects encouraged the Directors to make a liberal and unsparing expenditure: nevertheless the returns were ample and on 24 June 1847 they were able to pay a dividend of 50% for the one and three-quarter years since first breaking ground. Since then they have paid dividends amounting to £221,760 without any visible impoverishment of their resources. On the contrary, their productive capabilities are richer than ever and there seems to be no fear of any discontinuance of their quarterly dividend of 200%.</p>
<p>In the five years to 30 September last they have raised more than 56,428 tons, of which 18,692 were raised in the last twelve months. On the 30 September last there were employed:</p>
<p>Tributers 254</p>
<p>Tutworkmen 77</p>
<p>Men timbering 16</p>
<p>Chief timbermen 2</p>
<p>Pitman 1</p>
<p>Mine Labourers 8</p>
<p>Total employed underground 358</p>
<p>Dressing the ore men 254</p>
<p>boys 74</p>
<p>Also employed above ground:</p>
<p>Men weighing ores 12</p>
<p>Landers 8</p>
<p>Whim boys 29</p>
<p>Carters 20</p>
<p>Stablemen 7</p>
<p>Carpenters 28</p>

<p>Stone, timber, iron, powder</p>
<p>&amp; candles 20007</p>
<p>Machinery 5096</p>
<p>Horses, drivers &amp; fodder 3075</p>
<p>Exchange, discount &amp; interest 5693</p>
<p>Office salaries 3667</p>
<p>Expenses of establishment 1793</p>
<p>Port agency 1633</p>
<p>Cartage of copper 2395</p>
<p>Cartage of ores 14344</p>
<p>Buildings at the Burra Burra 13044</p>
<p>Mineral &amp; other lands bought 15458</p>
<p>Examinations, workings</p>
<p>&amp; buildings thereon 699</p>
<p>These disbursements coupled with the dividends paid have put into circulation £244,456 in one year.</p>
<p>The richness of the ores have also induced the establishment of several smelting establishments within the province – probably benefiting the colony to the extent of about £60,000 annually for the last two years. These will render merchantable a vast amount of copper from ores not sufficiently metalliferous to bear the cost of exportation in their crude state.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Association is an extensive seller of copper received from the Kooringa and other smelting plants as the proceeds from moderate and comparatively low percentage ores, which it would not pay to send to UK or European markets.</p>
<p>The Patent Copper Co. has received 10,981 tons of ores in the past year for 432 tons of metallic copper, valued at c. £31,000.</p>
<p>Captain Roach’s report indicates the Karkulto Mine will prove exceedingly fortunate.</p>
<p>He recounts the discovery of a large rich lode of malachite while excavating the foundations of the house for the new winding machine and of this already 60 tons of 40% have been obtained.</p>
<p>The new engine shaft is 13 ft by 8 ft and the sinking is being done by six men and is now at 14 fathoms in favourable ground. The shaft is well timbered.</p>
<p>Captain Roach hopes to have the crusher working in two months, which will save much work presently done by hand.</p>
<p>At present he reports:</p>
<p>45 whim &amp; whip shafts</p>
<p>7 trial shafts</p>
<p>35 winzes &amp; ladder roads</p>
<p>3,876 fathoms of levels (or 41⁄3 miles) and excavation of 30,185 cubic yards.</p>
<p>His report is eloquent in describing the richness of the mine.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. A son of Mr Forrester, the landlord of the Gilbert Arms Hotel, River Gilbert, has died as a result of a riding accident. The child was only nine or ten and was out on horseback after cattle. The alarm was raised when the mare returned to the stable without the child. The body was found a short distance from the house in a fearful state. It is conjectured that the boy fell from the saddle and was dragged some distance when one of his feet was caught in the stirrup leather. It appears the mare kicked him several times, as his skull was fractured in four places. Help was immediately sent for from Gawler, but the child died before the arrival of Doctor Mahony [sic].</p>
<p>[This death does not appear in SA Deaths CD, but BISA suggests it was Edmund Bowman Forrester, whose birth was registered as 10 May 1842 near Willunga.]</p>

<p>Police Commissioner Alex Tolmer’s Report</p>
<p>Extract from the Government Gazette of 31 October 1850.</p>
<p>Apoinga Police. C.M. Penny, proprietor of the Apoinga Smelting Works made forceful representations to His Excellency on the need for police protection there. Consequently a temporary police station was formed there on 21 September. In the event that it is found expedient to make this permanent, I would respectfully recommend that the station be located in the vicinity of Hornsby’s public house. This is a central position and would aid those requiring assistance at Kapunda Mines, Burra Burra and the surrounding area. It would be a convenient halting place for police convening prisoners to Adelaide.</p>

<p>Public meeting at Kooringa</p>
<p>The tone of this meeting to discuss a range of political matters was decidedly liberal. W. Lang chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>There was a proposal to extend the franchise to all holders of tenements of the annual value of £5, but what was carried by a large majority was a declaration in favour of universal suffrage.</p>
<p>The system of voting by ballot was strongly opposed by the chairman, but carried by a large majority.</p>
<p>15 November 1850, pages 2 &amp; 3</p>
<p>Public Meeting at Kooringa on the New Constitution</p>
<p>The appointed day for the meeting to discuss the new constitution at Kooringa was Monday 11 November. In honour of the occasion flags fluttered over the principal stores and larger shops, some of which were decorated with evergreens; especially the emporium of Marks and Gollin. Business seemed to continue unabated and the Mine and Smelting Works were operating as usual.</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. crowds assembled at the Burra Hotel until it was ‘necessary to adjourn to the pile of buildings recently added to that extensive structure, and known as the “Oddfellows’ Hall and Kooringa Assembly-room,” a splendid apartment (the second in the colony), fifty-eight feet long, thirty-one feet wide, and eighteen feet high, lighted from each side and one end by well-proportioned windows. There were upwards of two hundred persons present.’</p>
<p>[This seems to be the first report that clearly identifies the Oddfellows’ Lodge Hall.]</p>
<p>W. Lang, the Resident Magistrate took the chair pro tem.</p>
<p>He had called the meeting in response to a requisition for a meeting to discuss getting adequate representation for the towns of the Burra Burra Mines in the reformed Legislative Council and to consider whether the time had come for forming those townships into an Incorporated Borough of Kooringa.</p>
<p>Mr Lang introduced the reasons for the meeting and was then voted into the chair.</p>
<p>Rev. Cheetham proposed: ‘That this meeting congratulates their fellow colonists on the prospect of the arrival of the new constitution as the advent of Representative Government.’</p>
<p>He gave a lengthy speech on the virtues of representative government and believed it would prove a much more economical form of government. It was also desirable on the ground of equality and liberty, both civil and religious.</p>
<p>Mr E. Fitzgerald seconded and made a few remarks. Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald then moved: ‘This meeting is of the opinion, in order to secure the full benefit to arise from the new Legislative Council, that the franchise should be enjoyed by every freeholder and leaseholder, and by all persons occupying premises of the annual value of £5 and upwards.’ Seconded by Mr Godfrey.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald had argued the importance of a proper number of representatives, so that their community should have full weight in the Council. It was also important that those representatives should understand their wants and fairly express their wishes.</p>
<p>‘The resolution did not go to the length of demanding universal suffrage, but it approached it as nearly as possible, consistent with the necessary precautions to keep in check the mere outcasts, the wandering vagabonds of society, whose habitual tendencies would prompt them to injure rather than serve the public they preyed upon.’</p>
<p>He considered that a £5 franchise would place political rights in the hand of every industrious man and would not disqualify any honest or virtuous male adult.</p>
<p>Mr Burgess craved the attention of the meeting that he might remind them that the effect of the resolution must be to disqualify fully two-thirds of the inhabitants of Kooringa. One half of the young men present at the meeting would be disqualified by it. It would disqualify the respected son of their much esteemed chairman.</p>
<p>The Chairman said: ‘Serve him right. He should qualify.’ (Roars of laughter.)</p>
<p>Mr Burgess asked whether the inhabitants of the creek would be more honest, industrious, thrifty and intelligent if they were translated from their humble habitations to the best houses in the town.</p>
<p>He might not entertain views in accordance with the majority, but nevertheless he would move an amendment in favour of universal suffrage. He also pointed out that a number of men resided by agreement in substantial houses owned by the Copper Company and occupied without a lease and without the payment of rent. They would be disqualified under the £5 criterion.</p>
<p>Mr Lang reminded then that the original wording was that the occupied premises had merely to be worth £5 annually. Mr Burgess pointed out that the valuation would be difficult to establish as there was no assessment in the town. In any case he believed universal suffrage was the inherent right of the race.</p>
<p>He therefore moved his amendment: ‘That all residents in the borough 21 years of age and untainted with crime should enjoy the franchise.’</p>
<p>Mr Budd admitted that at home [i.e. in the UK] he was a Chartist, but that was very different from being a Red Republican. He supported Rev. Burgess’ remarks. All had the right to the franchise whether they were without a sixpence in their pockets, or the opulent lords of broad acres. He seconded the amendment.</p>
<p>Rev. Pollitt spoke in favour of an educational test for the franchise. He doubted the wisdom of giving the vote to those who were illiterate, who neglected the education of their children, and who were ‘regardless of their character here or their fate hereafter’.</p>
<p>‘He was certain that no honest and industrious man need be six months in the colony until he could qualify under the resolution.’</p>
<p>Mr Pearce addressed questions to the last speaker through the chair.</p>
<p>Could more than two-thirds of the population of the Burra townships read and write? And if not should the remainder be disenfranchised? Would occupants of houses of annual value of £5 be disenfranchised if they could not read and write?</p>
<p>Mr Pearce said there were many intelligent young men living in Kooringa who chose to live in lodgings as best suiting their needs at the present. He suggested it was unjust to disenfranchise a young man who might be saving money for a marriage or whose wife had not yet followed him to his new place of employment.</p>
<p>Mr Pearce supported universal suffrage as in the amendment.</p>
<p>Rev. Cheetham also supported the amendment for similar reasons.</p>
<p>The Chairman said he disapproved of universal suffrage.</p>
<p>When the proposals were put 48 supported the amendment and 29 supported the resolution.</p>
<p>The amendment was declared carried.</p>
<p>Mr Burgess then proposed: ‘That to protect the electors in the free enjoyment of the franchise, and to prevent bribery or intimidation being resorted to, the mode of election should be by ballot.’</p>
<p>He had heard the secret ballot denounced as un-English and unmanly. Nevertheless it was used in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, in the clubs, to elect committees in the House of Commons and by the Masons and Oddfellows. He had known an instance where an elector went 20 miles to vote against his conscience, but by adopting the ballot such a thing could not occur in SA. Mr Morgan seconded the motion.</p>
<p>Mr Gollin in supporting the motion referred to the local situation and the possibility of many hesitating to vote against a candidate nominated by the Directors of the Mining Company if the voting was not secret. He also referred to cases of buying votes ‘at home’.</p>
<p>The Chairman was strongly opposed to the ballot. No man should conceal an honest opinion and no man could be called free and independent who was afraid or ashamed to avow his principles. A man should express his vote in the face of day and court enquiry for his own reputation. If the electors wanted to operate under a cloak of secrecy, why should not their representatives do the same when voting? (As did the deputies in France.)</p>
<p>The danger of persecution for an honest exercise of the franchise was greatly overstated.</p>
<p>The motion was carried on a show of hands.</p>
<p>Mr Pollitt then moved: ‘That this meeting would beg to suggest to the Lieutenant-Governor that, in the division of the colony into electoral districts, the claims of those townships to a representation equal to the proportional number of inhabitants may be considered.’ Mr Gollin seconded the motion.</p>
<p>It was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr Harris then moved: ‘That a memorial, founded on the foregoing resolutions, be prepared and forwarded to the Lieutenant-Governor, and advertised in the newspapers, and that a subscription be entered into to defray the necessary expenses.’ Seconded by Mr Brannon and carried without dissent.</p>
<p>A vote of thanks to Mr Lang was carried by acclamation. Mr Burgess observed that had the meeting been called for 6 p.m. instead of 3 p.m. it would have been necessary to adjourn to the open air.</p>

<p>Oddfellows at Kooringa. The completion of the extensive new building attached to the Burra Burra Hotel was celebrated by members of the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows MU by a dinner last Thursday. Over 100 persons attended, including most of the principal citizens. The enterprise of the proprietor of the hotel in erecting such an extensive and costly building is praiseworthy. It exceeds anything in the colony and provides a venue calculated to promote harmony and conviviality in a town destitute of social amusement. The main room measures 60 feet by 37 feet and is 18 ft high. There are also other smaller rooms and an extensive range of rooms on the basement. The room was designed principally for the Burra Burra Lodge of Oddfellows, whose increasing numbers required larger accommodation than was available in Kooringa. The building is in the splendid local stone and is calculated to strike the stranger on his entrance into the town. We were favoured with a preview of the interior. The splendid main hall recalled ‘The Albion’, ‘Freemasons’ Hall’ and other celebrated taverns in London. The dinner embraced all the delicacies of the season and showed the greatest care in its preparation. Mr Paxton had been invited to chair the gathering, but in his absence Mr Mortlock filled that position. A ball was held the following evening.</p>

<p>Notice. Kooringa Infirmary.</p>
<p>Patron W. Allen Esq.</p>
<p>President W.H. Browne Esq.</p>
<p>Trustees W. Paxton Esq., Dr Kent, J.G. Nash Esq.</p>
<p>Treasurer J.C. Coke Esq.</p>
<p>Hon. Secretary Thomas William Powell</p>
<p>And under the management of a committee of 12.</p>
<p>The township of Kooringa, being the centre of large mining operations, is the resort of a great number of new emigrants as well as a large number of bullock-drivers who are constantly coming and going. Thus there is a community either living in tents or crowded boarding-houses in conditions liable to promote fever, the spread of diseases and accidents. Within 30 miles of Kooringa it is estimated there are woodcutters, miners, shepherds, smelters, sawyers, bullock-drivers and labourers amounting to 3,000 (exclusive of those working on the Burra Burra Mine or for the Smelting Company) who in case of disease have no place of resort for medical treatment.</p>
<p>To enable such of these men who are able and willing to pay for hospital treatment as well as to afford help to those unable to do so, the committee is soliciting contributions to erect a building to be called the Kooringa Infirmary. Subscription may be left at the Union Bank, the Bank of South Australia or with Henry Ayers Esq., Secretary of the SA Mining Association or Messrs Boord Brothers of Hindley Street.</p>
<p>Kooringa Court. People at Kooringa complain with good reason that the authorities have failed to erect or even to rent a suitable building for the dispensing of justice. The hovel now designated the Court-House is contemptible in appearance and so small that parties attending on business, except those actually being examined, have to stand outside, whether in hot or rainy weather. There are also not three magistrates within the requisite distance to constitute a Local Court of full jurisdiction and for that it is necessary to travel to Clare Village for the adjudication of all suits for amounts exceeding £5.</p>

<p>Advertisement. E. Solomon &amp; Co. have been instructed by the proprietor (who is leaving for England) to auction ten Burra Burra Shares at 12 o’clock on Wednesday 4 December. To enable men of moderate means to buy one or more of these shares the proprietor is prepared to sell at 20% cash, 20% in one month, 20% in two months, 20% in three months and 20% in four months; leaving the two dividends to accumulate for the benefit of the purchasers.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Races</p>
<p>At a meeting at the Burra Burra Hotel on 25 October chaired by W.R. Mortlock it was decided to hold the Burra Burra Races on 1 &amp; 2 January 1851.</p>
<p>On 1 January there will be three races: The Miners’ Plate over 11⁄2 miles, a Hurdle Race over 11⁄2 miles and a Hack Race.</p>
<p>On 2 January there will be two races: the Smelters’ Cup over 1 mile and a distance, the Burra Burra Town Plate over 2 miles.</p>

<p>Police Court, Kooringa, 25 November</p>
<p>Thomas Haldane was charged by Robert Henderson with breaking down his house door on 23 November and assaulting him. Henderson said the accused came to his house at 4 a.m. and knocked for entrance. When this was denied he forced the door open. Henderson was greatly frightened by his demeanour and threatened to get a gun and shoot him. Haldane then struck him and tore his shirt. Others living near then came and got the defendant away.</p>
<p>John Tylor slept in the same room as Henderson and corroborated his account.</p>
<p>James Houghton lived nearby and came in after the struggle. Defendant was present and did not deny the account Henderson gave of the incident as above.</p>
<p>Haldane said he had been living with the complainant and on being refused admission had pushed on the door, which had opened. He had struck the complainant only when apprehensive that Henderson would shoot him as he threatened.</p>
<p>His Worship considered the charge proved and fined Haldane 40/- plus costs and bound him over to keep the peace for six months.</p>
<p>26 November</p>
<p>William Gibson was charged with stealing three money orders from George Evans.</p>
<p>Evans had received the money orders from the Patent Copper Company and that evening had gone to sleep under his dray with the orders in his trousers, which he placed under his head. Next morning he found his trousers outside the tarpaulin and the orders gone. He went to the Copper Company, got the numbers and reported them to the police.</p>
<p>Constable George Nixon found that an order for £9 had been changed that morning at Marks &amp; Gollin’s store. Mr Gollin accompanied him in a search for the man who had changed the order and was able to identify the prisoner as the person. When arrested Gibson had on him orders for £6, £3, 2/6 and 7/5 in coins.</p>
<p>Bezaleel Gollin gave corroborative evidence. He also said he gave the prisoner a £6 order in change, but was unable to identify the order found on Gibson.</p>
<p>Charles Mosebey, lodging-house keeper, said the prisoner, who had lodged with him in Adelaide, came to his house at about 6 a.m. Mosebey refused to let him in until he had paid a debt incurred in Adelaide. Gibson paid with an order for £1-17-6. Witness paid the order away for some meat at Boord’s store. Witness’s wife accompanied Gibson to Marks &amp; Gollin’s store, where he paid for purchases with a £9 order. The order produced was the same.</p>
<p>Edward Hall confirmed Moseby’s purchase at Boord’s store.</p>
<p>Gibson was remanded to the next day for further evidence.</p>
<p>2 December 1850, page 3</p>
<p>Police Court, Kooringa, 27 November.</p>
<p>Continuation of the Gibson case.</p>
<p>George Bevan, clerk at the Patent Copper Co. said he had paid the money order produced to George Evans, who was employed carting wood and coal for the company.</p>
<p>Esther Sophia Mosbey [sic: husband was Mosebey the previous day.] corroborated her husband’s evidence.</p>
<p>The prisoner was cautioned and he refused to make any defence. He was committed for trial in Adelaide.</p>
<p>George Hiles was charged by Joseph Barrett with assaulting him. Complainant was employed by Hiles as a shepherd about 15 miles from Kooringa. He had gone to the head station to enquire about a dog and Hiles had knocked him down and kicked him severely.</p>
<p>Defendant said complainant had abused the defendant’s partner and then when told to return to his sheep, he had rushed at the defendant with an open knife, which the defendant had taken from him and thrown away.</p>
<p>John Chewings corroborated Hiles story and produced the knife.</p>
<p>William Stoneham was shearing sheep at the defendant’s woolshed when he heard the disturbance. He saw the complainant rush at the defendant with the knife and saw Hiles take the knife and strike Barrett.</p>
<p>His Worship dismissed the complaint and ordered costs to be divided.</p>
<p>Henry Nankervis was charged by James Edward Bromley with hooting after him and calling him a lag. Nankervis admitted the charge and apologised. His Worship said the offence was regarded by the law as a very grave one.</p>
<p>‘The complainant was now a respectable young man, and whatever he may have been formerly no person was justified in taunting him with it to his injury and annoyance.</p>
<p>‘Complainant stated that he did not wish the defendant to be punished, his object being only to assert his right to the protection of the law; and as defendant had expressed regret, he would wish to withdraw the information.</p>
<p>‘His Worship would only allow it to be done by the defendant paying costs.’</p>
<p>16 December 1850, page 3</p>
<p>Resident Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, 9 December.</p>
<p>Alexander Middleton was charged by John Solomon Barnett with having, while in the complainant’s employ, sold a piece of brown holland, value 7/-, and not accounted for the money. (Adjourned from 29 November.)</p>
<p>After Middleton had been discharged in September or October Barnett’s brother had told him that Middleton had sold some brown holland to Mrs O’Leary, which he had not accounted for and which he denied selling.</p>
<p>Lewis Barnett said that the defendant and another employee named Gregory had gone out in a cart hawking goods. When they returned the piece of holland was missing. Middleton said he must either have left it at Mrs O’Leary’s or lost it. All other goods were accounted for.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald, acting for Middleton, asked if witness had ever written to his brother suggesting that this mistake on Middleton’s part provided a good reason for breaking the six month contract between them. Witness said he could not remember.</p>
<p>Mary O’Leary said her husband kept the Sod Hut public-house. She said the defendant and Gregory had visited her and she had bought several articles including a piece of brown holland. The yard measure was left behind at her house.</p>
<p>Other evidence was given, but His Worship said the error charged in this case might be accidental and he could not see it in any other light. It was proved that the holland was sold to Mrs O’Leary and the defendant would have to pay for it and the costs of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Robert Carson was charged by Robert Collins with taking away a bullock belonging to him.</p>
<p>James Tarr gave evidence that the bullock in question was one he had sold to Robert Collins.</p>
<p>Carson said the bullock belongs to him and he had lost it about three years and eight months ago.</p>
<p>Collins said he had bought the bullock from Tarr in May 1850.</p>
<p>Case adjourned.</p>
<p>10 December</p>
<p>Robert Carson case resumed.</p>
<p>James Tarr said he had bought the bullock as one of two from Joseph Wasley.</p>
<p>Joseph Wasley said he had bought it from William Bartle (who had gone to California) and sold it to James Tarr.</p>
<p>William Tregea was present when Wasley bought the bullock and when Bartle had made his mark on the receipt.</p>
<p>His Worship ruled that the defendant was unable to show by evidence that the bullock belonged to him and ordered it be returned to the complainant.</p>
<p>11 December</p>
<p>Mary Jones was fined 5/- for being drunk.</p>
<p>Tristram Bath appeared as Superintendent of the Princess Royal Mines to the complaint of James Nicholls. Nicholls said he and other miners had raised copper ore, which the company had agreed to take at a certain percentage. The agreement had been made by Captain Pascoe, now in Adelaide. The company was now about to remove the ore without settling with the men. They had also sent the men a bill, bringing them into debt, charging them with backing the ore, which was contrary to usage and to the agreement with Captain Pascoe.</p>
<p>Case adjourned to allow all parties to produce necessary evidence.</p>
<p>23 December 1850, page 3</p>
<p>Accident/Obituary. About a fortnight ago a terrible accident occurred to the wife of a labourer employed at the Smelting Works. While cooking her husband’s breakfast, her clothes caught fire and before any assistance could be given they were burnt off her, literally roasting her body. She lingered in great agony till the twelfth day. The deceased was one of the Irish orphans recently arrived and had been married only about three months. A collection raised to defray funeral and other costs has been carried off by her heartless husband, who has gone to Adelaide, leaving a kind fellow workman liable for the funeral and for a suit of clothes kindly lent that he might appear decently at the funeral. It is to be hoped that justice will soon overtake this ungrateful scamp, application having been made to the Resident Magistrate for that purpose.</p>
<p>[The absence of names here means identification is not straightforward, but the following information is quite persuasive. Marriage registrations for SA show a Fredrick Paterson married Bridget Ambrose on 5 October 1850 at Clare. Bridget gave her age as 19. On 17 December 1850 Bridget Patterson died. She was then said to be 16 and her marital status was not stated, but the relative is said to be Frederick Paterson.]</p>
<p>26 December 1850, pages 2 &amp; 3</p>
<p>A Trip to Kooringa</p>
<p>An SA colonist who has not visited Burra has neglected to inspect a marvel. It is a triumph of co-operative enterprise, liberality and economy, as credible to its directors as it is profitable to its owners and beneficial to the colony. I enquired as to the most expeditious and cheapest mode of visiting Burra Burra. A seat was suggested in the travelling chariot with the Directors on one of their periodic visits to the Mine. Not knowing the Directors and not wishing to wait for such a grand occasion, I took a seat in the mail cart, a van-shaped vehicle covered with canvas and capable of containing about ten passengers. The proprietor, whose easy manner put everyone in good humour, managed to stow twelve in it. Even an old lady whose bonnet box was cruelly crushed declared that no one could be angry with Mr Chambers. He went at a brisk pace through Hindmarsh, descending gullies and scaling banks with great confidence. When conversation began when we got fairly on the lower road, each assured the rest that the dust was intolerable. One of the passengers said he had just returned from California, of which he gave a graphic account. He had saved a good sum at the Burra Burra and wishing to try his fortune in exchanging copper for gold, set off for San Francisco. His degree of success could be judged from his wasted face and squalid appearance. [His story then continues for several paragraphs.]</p>
<p>We left Adelaide at c. 3.30 p.m. and reached Gawler Town at about 7 p.m. We put up at the Old Spot where Mr Schmidt maintained the reputation of the place established by its founder, Mr Calton. The next morning the group divided. The Kapunda passengers went on in a spring cart. Burra Burra passengers continued in a spring cart without any covering. The horses too were greatly inferior and had but one shoe among the four of them and one with a swollen leg and the others with worn hoofs, so that it was with great difficulty they were induced to move at all. On arrival at She Oak Log there were no fresh horses ready and the mail was handed over to the driver of the spring cart, which could proceed much faster. Progress to Kapunda was slow and one of the passengers had often to alight to flog the crippled horse, but eventually the driver was compelled to set it free – which had he done it at first would have saved much time.</p>
<p>We breakfasted at Ferrant’s just on entering Kapunda where everything was in good order and readiness, despite our much delayed arrival. Newcomers of the roughest class joined the vehicle here and soon made a seat in the mail cart a very unenviable position. One of the men was a fine specimen of the ‘old colonial bore’, who insisted on recounting his hair-raising adventures. He was, however, eclipsed by the arrival of an Irish wench whose gross language and forward behaviour is beyond description. The coarse behaviour and conversation continued till we reached the Burra Hotel.</p>
<p>At the Burra Hotel it was Saturday night and the part set aside for the sale of strong drink was full of people in every condition from sober through exhilarated and joyous to quarrelsome and singing and crying drunk. Germans were singing a chorus in one corner and Welsh smelters were listening to a Celtic solo in another. Cornish miners, English and Scotch mechanics and Irish labourers all combined to swell the mighty discord.</p>
<p>In contrast the hotel rooms were spacious, cool and well-furnished apartments, where the din of voices was softened by distance. The waiter glided noiselessly about and I enjoyed a hearty dinner and went out for a moonlight view of Kooringa. It differed in no respect from any other thriving town. There were a number of large shops and a great concourse of people marketing in a quiet and orderly fashion. I did not see one policeman, or any occasion for one.</p>
<p>[When this article was reprinted in the Burra Record 94, 38, 3 Oct. 1972, pages 1 &amp; 8, a note was added, presumably by Ian Auhl:</p>
<p>‘The towns of Redruth and Aberdeen had only been laid out in August 1849, which explains why the writer does not refer to them. The population of Kooringa including the dugouts was 4,300 in 1850.]</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday and the Sabbath was strictly observed. Besides the [Anglican] Church there were chapels for the Wesleyans, Independents and Primitive Methodists and the Roman Catholics and divine service in a private house.</p>
<p>There are several streets and the houses are generally well built. In some places are rows of substantial stone cottages built by the company. The chimneys of one of them having as much masonry as would suffice for two of the flimsy building society cottages which disgrace the streets of Adelaide. There seems to be an abundance of good stone in Kooringa, which the inhabitants are putting to good use.</p>
<p>One of Kooringa’s most singular features is the subterranean habitations of ‘The Creek’. For a distance of more than two miles the banks of a ravine are perforated with vaulted chambers in which a populous is living in apparent health and comfort. From above those dwellings (to which some future etymologist, with the accuracy characteristic of his study, will trace the name of Burra (Burrow)), present a squalid, but exceedingly diversified and picturesque appearance. Some are quite cottage-like in their exterior, having stone fronts, well proportioned doors and windows, with verandahs and fences guarding the approach. In those cases the earth is cut away to give a perpendicular front and that secures a sort of terrace before the door. But in many instances there is merely a horizontal cut running far enough into the bank to gain a height for an approach to a door with a similar cut of smaller proportions for a window and the rest of the house is a perforation of the bank continued from these apertures. In most cases the chimney is level with the surface, or raised a foot or two by a pile of a few stones or partially embedding a headless flour or ale cask. Accidents sometimes happen when night walkers fall down the chimneys. Their arms generally arrest their descent, but they remain caught until rescued by an occupant from below, either furious or friendly as the case may be.</p>
<p>On Monday I visited the Mine, which is situated on the side of a hill. A considerable stream of water flows down the acclivity fed by the steam engine, which works incessantly day and night raising nearly 800 gallons of water every minute. Diverted into suitable channels, it carries on the work of washing ore and an immense space is occupied by heaps of rich green and blue ore in every stage of preparation, from the immense masses sent up by the miners to be washed and pulverised and carefully packed into canvas bags for removal by bullock drays to the port, or to the smelting works of the Patent Copper Co. on the other side of the creek. Under extensive sheds men and boys of all sizes carry on the operation of ore crushing etc.</p>
<p>The revolving whims and ceaseless stroke of the immense pump excited at once a dread and uneasy desire to visit the workings underground. Introduced by Captain Roach to the Captain’s Changing Room, I was equipped with a candle in one hand and a piece of tempered clay in the other. I followed the guide to whose care Captain Roach assigned me. We went under a shed near a whim and the top of a ladder protruded from a hole just large enough to allow a man to descend. My guide lit the candle and surrounded it with tempered clay, which he stuck against my hat and told me to follow him. We descended about 16 feet to a landing and then took another ladder and so on until we had reached 30 fathoms. My guide said we were in Peacock’s level and introduced me to several chambers where vast deposits of malachite and other rich ores had been found. In some places the level had been excavated through solid rock and in other parts the earth was soft and damp and there the passage was strongly timbered and boarded. No expense seemed to be spared in securing the comfort and safety of the workers. In places several inches of water, apparently pure and clear, flowed along the level, but above it was a boarded floor, along which the miners walked dry shod. I frequently came to men at work. Some said the ore they were getting was poor, but would be called very rich in England. Others were operating on large fronts of malachite. They said the mineral was richer and more abundant at the 40 fathom level, but as there was some feet of water in the level and the footway was wet, I had no desire to go deeper. In the 30 fathom level I met Captain Matthews, who greeted me courteously and led me to several most remarkable places. On emerging into the light of day I returned to the Captain’s Change Room, where the kindness of Captain Roach allowed me to make a very needful toilet.</p>
<p>After taking leave of Captain Roach I walked towards the works of the Patent Copper Co., but the sight of the flowing furnaces on such a hot day quite evaporated my curiosity and I returned to the Burra Hotel just in time to be present at a public meeting of the inhabitants of Kooringa and the surrounding townships.</p>
<p>The meeting had been called to consider the propriety of demanding municipal institutions for the united townships, but in fact the propositions put did not mention this at all. I afterwards found that the words intimating this cause were inserted into the requisition calling the meeting to please the few who think with the Resident Magistrate that such is desirable, but the majority fear the expense of a corporation would more than outweigh its advantages and so avoided the subject.</p>
<p>Other matters observed:</p>
<p>There is a flourishing Oddfellows’ Lodge there of the Manchester Unity and it meets in a splendid room recently added to the Burra Hotel. It possesses a library of 1,000 volumes from which it lends books at a cheap rate to all who wish to avail themselves of such a service.</p>
<p>The people generally think residence in the creek unhealthy, and it is certain that fever prevails there occasionally. To me, however, the women and children appeared both numerous and healthy and on the Sunday I was in Kooringa it turned out a vast concourse of well-dressed persons who wound their way to different houses of worship. It is thought there is a population in the creek of about 1,000 and there are at least 200 houses there. The approaching census will give the correct numbers. The people complain of the want of a local court of full jurisdiction and are ashamed of the hovel in which their respected Magistrate disposes justice. There are fears that the engine pump of the mine will exhaust all the wells in the town – several having gone dry since it has been at work.</p>
<p>The return to Adelaide presented the same dust and delays for want of horses.</p>
<p>[When this article was reprinted in the Burra Record 94, 38, 3 Oct. 1972, pages 1 &amp; 8, a note was added, presumably by Ian Auhl:</p>
<p>‘This three day journey to Burra in 1880 cost $2 plus overnight expenses at Gawler and Kapunda. The trip by Mail Cart went via Gawler, Sheoak Log, Kapunda, Tothill’s Creek, Apoinga, Emu Springs and Sod Hut. Hornsby’s hotel still stands at Apoinga. The Burra Hotel was later the Burra Hospital and the last of the old building was demolished in 1967.’]</p>

<p>Cornwall &amp; Devon Society</p>
<p>A public meeting was held on 23 December 1850 at the Exchange with John Bentham Neales in the chair. Its object was the formation of the Cornwall and Devon Society, the aims of which would be to promote direct emigration from those two Counties and to watch out for the interests of colonists who have come from those Counties. A committee was formed of about 40 and almost half of them were Mine Captains. [They are named and those from Burra were: Captain Boundy, Captain Samuel Osborne and Captain Roach. Donations and subscriptions amounted to c. £50 to further the society’s aims.]</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. Messrs G.S. Kingston &amp; F. Beck, Directors of the association, accompanied by Mr H. Ayers, Secretary and Mr Macdonald, Cashier, started yesterday on the usual visit to the Burra Burra and other mines.</p>
<p>8 January 1851, pages 2 &amp; 3</p>
<p>Cornwall &amp; Devon Society met on 7 January, with Mr J.B. Neales, the permanent Chairman, presiding.</p>
<p>The Chairman said that the land purchased by him on account of the Gold Company entitled the introduction of 73 persons and the Emu Flats purchase to a similar number. The orders had been handed to the SA Mining Association who had posted a notice at the mine calling on miners to send in the names of relatives they were anxious to have sent out from home. The Directors selected the required number of the most eligible persons. It was not generally known, or at least not generally acted upon, that the purchase of 80 acres entitled the buyer to introduce three adults to the colony.</p>
<p>[Neales then went on to list the amount of copper ore sent home from mines other than the Burra Burra and the Kapunda mines and said it totalled 10,000 tones, with a value of £150,000 at £15 per ton. Also some £15,000 worth of silver-lead had been sent home from the Glen Osmond Mine. These figures indicated the highly remunerative employment that awaited the skill and enterprise of the Cornish miner.]</p>
<p>Mr James said there was a general feeling in the public that the object of the society was to reduce the wages of miners. Neales said that could not be helped, but it was a great injustice to their motives as well as a fallacy to suppose that would be a result. It was far more important to get good men and have the work done than to reduce wages. He said it was not the arrival of more workers that had depressed wages in SA, but the transition from the profuse expenditure of Colonel Gawler to the rigid economy of Captain Grey that had caused a commercial collapse and the value of property had fallen even more that the price of labour.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Races. These were run last Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday it was a holiday in the town with shops closing at 10 a.m. After that time the road to the racecourse (11⁄2 miles from town) was crammed with every available vehicle. Upwards of 2,000 are estimated to have attended the first day. It seemed every publican within 30 miles had a gaily decorated booth. There was a grandstand as well as a judges’ stand and weighing stand. The band occupied the grandstand and the police arrangements were most excellent under the care of Sergeant Lamb and his men. E.B. Gleeson was judge and Mr Hallack was the starter.</p>
<p>On Wednesday four races were run. [Details are given.]</p>
<p>On Thursday another four races were run. [Details are also printed.]</p>
<p>The third race on Wednesday was the Hack Race. In the first heat Mr Hill’s Cherry was the winner. And the second heat was won by Mr Warland’s Old Joe. There was a protest against Old Joe on the grounds that he was not qualified to run, not having been within 15 miles of Kooringa on 25 October. The stewards found he had been entered under a false name. Cherry had come second in heat two, but had gone inside the post, making it difficult to decide the winner of the heat. It was decided to re-run the race and this was done on the third day, Cherry coming in the easy winner.</p>
<p>Several other privately arranged races were run for saddles etc.</p>

<p>Cornwall &amp; Devon Society (Editorial)</p>
<p>[The editor says he disagrees with Mr Neales comments that prisoners at Dartmoor (in England) will be employed in mining, before going on to other matters. The editor gives a generally favourable view of the aims of the society and does not join with those who might fear its aims included the reduction in wages. He puts any illiberal aspects of the administration of mining in SA down to inexperience with mining affairs, rather ‘than from any innate churlishness or acquired habits of parsimony. The editor does not, however, go along with any suggestion that the state should be giving any aid to mining interests in the form of ‘bounty or adventitious support’.]</p>

<p>Journal of a tour in the North:</p>
<p>23 December 1850. Started in the barge Lady Young for Port Wakefield.</p>
<p>24 December 1850. Arrived at Port Wakefield at 5 p.m. The port is a very small creek of about 30 feet width and 60 feet in a few spots. At low water it is dry except for one or two holes. The flats around it are impassable at high tide to a ship drawing six feet. The Patent Copper Company is deepening the creek in parts and has constructed a valuable wharf for their barges. The town is situated on a bottom of clay, sand and broken shell and the site is covered with a thick scrub, mangroves and salsolaceous plants. There are about nine houses of tolerable size; one or two in stone and the rest in logs and palings. The public house accommodation is very good.</p>
<p>25 December 1850. Christmas Day was very hot. The Lady Young was high and dry two miles from the shore, which meant we had to wait 15 or 16 days for another barge, or go home via the Burra. A cart runs once a week from that place and the fare is £1 for 75 miles.</p>
<p>At the port the nearest water is 18 miles away and at a depth of 100 feet. Most eatables are cooked in salt water or a mixture of half salt and half fresh water. A drink for the horse costs 6d. Drays from Burra frequently numbering 90 are compelled to come from Dunn’s and return there after unloading before the bullocks can get a drink; a round trip of 36 miles in the broiling sun. When the Burra cart did not appear, I prepared for a forty-one mile walk to the nearest point the northern mail cart touches. I began the walk in very hot sun at 3 p.m., but after about 12 miles I saw the Burra Mail cart approaching. The driver had lost his horses in the hills. I mounted the cart and returned to Port Wakefield.</p>
<p>26 December 1850. Left Port Wakefield on the mail cart at 5 a.m. and breakfasted at Dunn’s – within a short distance of where the remains of the wife of the maniac Fry were discovered. More than 30 drays were camped there. The water is almost black due to the lining of the well with green gum and the smell it fetid, but it is otherwise good. Saw five or six eggs of the native pheasant – a bird slightly larger than a pigeon with an egg the size of a swan’s; fragile and pale pink, it is laid on the ground and hatches in the sun’s heat. At 10 a.m. started again – twelve to fourteen miles through pine scrub with bush fires all round. At last we reached Hoile’s Skillogalee Creek. There we met, as usual, a drunken mob of bullock drivers, playing cards, drinking, swearing and fighting. They are so little trusted that the landlord hold the nobler with one hand and takes the money with the other. ‘They are the most debased set of animals in South Australia.’ The horses had strayed, delaying us for three hours.</p>
<p>We soon reached Watervale, which has a pretty setting and two public houses. It was characterised by mobs of drunken bullock drivers, large gardens and cottages roofed in bark. Then we went up the Hutt River to Penwortham, Mr Horrock’s Station and thence to Clare. This thriving village is prettily located. There was the usual display of drunkenness.</p>
<p>27 December 1850. After breakfast we set out for the Burra through vast undulating plains of a light red and brown colour. There was no vegetation higher than a blade of spear grass to be seen, except upon some very distant hills. The only watercourse we crossed was the Hill River. At about 1 p.m. we entered the Burra by way of the Sydney Mine [i.e. the Bon Accord Mine], which is merely an excavation here and there, waiting for machinery. At the Burra great preparations were in hand for the races. We were struck by the sombre effect of the place; all the houses being built of stone, and the stone the same colour as the sand and being well peppered with the Burra dust.</p>
<p>The hills having no trees, there was nothing to relieve the eye as it wandered over the uniform whitey-brown colouring of hill, valley and house, but this did not in the least interfere with the bustle of the place. There was plenty of coming and going, loading and unloading, etc.</p>
<p>‘In passing over the bridge leading to the Smelting Works, a picturesque feature struck upon my astonished gaze, viz., the “creek habitations;” which are nothing more or less than excavations of a small size in the banks of a rivulet, at the present time supplied with water from the engines at the mine.’</p>
<p>‘As far as the eye can reach down the creek, the human wombat holes are to be seen – one long hole for a door, and a small square or round one for a window; a perfect street, with above 1,500 residents.’</p>
<p>The Burra Creek is riddled like a honeycomb. From the bridge a fine view of the Mine on the west and of the Smelting Works on the east is obtained. Both are astonishing, given the age of the place; less than five years.</p>
<p>I took up my quarters at the residence of the hospitable clergyman and sallied forth to visit the place. From the top of the hill the whole Mine with its pumping engine, numerous shafts, whims, jigging sheds and appurtenances, beds of assorted ores, men and animals, noise and activity, burst upon my view.</p>
<p>I descended one of the shafts 35 fathoms and, accompanied an obliging miner with a candle in one hand, now stooping, now crawling, now ascending, now descending through gallery, pit, adit, level etc. The commentary suggested that the mine had been sinking, filling up places and rendering some very dangerous. The ore seemed to be mixed with the earth, not in veins.</p>
<p>I then inspected the jigging sheds – jiggers are simply an oblong box sieve suspended, holding a barrowful of ore, connected with a handle, which is jerked up and down by a man, the sieve being in a pool of water, constantly supplied by a stream which runs through the whole shed, and coming from the engine shaft. The engine is a ponderous piece of machinery which drains the whole mine of about five acres. It drives three or four pumps, the largest with a bore of nine inches and the depth of the shaft is 45 fathoms. It supplies water, which is of quite good quality, to Kooringa, Aberdeen and Redruth.</p>
<p>28 December 1850. I visited the Patent Copper Company Works; a mass of buildings with nineteen furnaces at work. I saw the process of casting. A row of iron moulds are placed around the furnace; one or two men fill them with the smelted ore; no all at once, but at six different times, each time with an iron ladle holding fourteen pounds; this is poured in, cools immediately; another is supplied and so on, until the six are completed. They are then turned out, separated, and their edges cleaned by boys and men. There is a sawmill attached for cutting the firewood to the required lengths. In the large yard adjacent the ore is mixed before smelting with the proper proportions of coal, iron ore and limestone; the whole being reduced to the size of pigeons’ eggs. From thence it is conveyed to a large funnel over each furnace.</p>
<p>We then visited one of the holes in the creek and found it very neat and clean and in one part an attempt at finery. It was very cool, but I was informed, very close at night, there being no ventilation. They are whitewashed inside and sometimes outside and most have paling verandahs, lean-tos etc. The chimneys are mere holes opening from the footpath above, with a tub or two and a few clods put round. As you pass you always know what is being cooked and there are many tales of fish or fowl disappearing up a chimney, having been hooked by a practical joker. The secret of selecting such a place is that it is rent free. Sickness prevails much and it is no wonder; the refuse is cast before the door. Pigs and children were numerous.</p>
<p>All the houses are built of substantial stone, but irregularly disposed, something like Adelaide of ten years ago. Rent is high, 10/- for two or three rooms and water 2/- a load.</p>
<p>The general currency is orders from the two great companies. Also the Aberdeen Hotel issues and Hutchings and a host of grocers. This is certainly a bad system and the only excuse is the scarcity of cash. A branch bank is most desirable.</p>
<p>29 December. I went to church in the morning and evening. At present it is in a temporary place, the future schoolroom. The Wesleyans are the strongest body.</p>
<p>30 December. I was up at 4 a.m. for a start for Adelaide and we left a little before 6 a.m. with rain. It was a miserable day with pouring rain from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., wretched horses and worse roads. Sod Hut, which is a stone building; Apoinga Mine, Tothill Scrub and Sheoak Log, which is a stone house, scarcely excited a look and so at length to the warmth of Mr Young’s Hotel at Gawler.</p>
<p>31 December 1850. Up early to travel to Adelaide, arriving at 1.30 p.m.</p>

<p>Accident at Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>A miner named Richard Jones had his back broken when a quantity of earth fell on him where he was working underground on Tuesday last. When our informant left Kooringa, Jones was languishing in a hopeless state.</p>
<p>22 January 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on Saturday before W. Lang, Resident Magistrate, on the body of Richard Jones.</p>
<p>Thomas Mills said he had been working with the deceased and was about five fathoms distant when the fall of earth occurred. Jones had called out and the witness went to him and found him lying on his back with about a barrowful of earth lying by him. Deceased said it had fallen from above and broken his back. Witness had carried him to the level and with assistance had got him to the surface. He did not think that part of the mine should have been propped until more ore had been got out.</p>
<p>Dr Chambers attended when the deceased was brought to the surface. He found a fracture of either the last dorsal or the first lumbar vertebrae. The lower body was paralysed as a consequence. He had no hopes of the injured man’s recovery. Deceased lived till Friday night.</p>
<p>Evidence was taken as to precautions taken to prevent such accidents underground. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The deceased was aged about 20 and had been a member of the Oddfellows’ Lodge. Most members of the Lodge followed the body to the grave on Sunday. The Rev. Mr Lowe delivered the address at the Wesleyan Chapel, of which the deceased was a member, and upwards of 1,000 persons attended the funeral.</p>
<p>[Died 17 January 1851, aged 24.]</p>
<p>23 January 1851, page 4</p>
<p>Mining in South Australia from the Correspondent of the London Mining Journal.</p>
<p>I have not written for some time, since it would hardly be worth the postage to repeat at intervals that the Burra Burra was going on as usual and that none of the other mines were doing anything worth mentioning.</p>
<p>[The writer suggests that in the general run of mines in SA a bit of surface scratching is done and if shiploads of malachite and red oxide are not uncovered above the watertable the place is abandoned.]</p>
<p>As for the Burra Burra: the lode is being cut in undiminished richness at the 40 fathom at 40-50% richness. Ayers’ Shaft has reached the 40 fathom level and they are driving on lode. (Kingston’s North Lode) The ground in the 40th requires a good deal of timbering and the uneasiness of shareholders saw shares changing hands at £142 when news was received that they had struck the lode. Shares immediately rose to £160. This news was also reassuring for Messrs Schneider &amp; Co. In the past sic months 622 tons of copper have been delivered to the Burra Burra Company and that with only about half of the smelting furnaces at work. This will materially reduce the cartage costs for ore.</p>
<p>The pumping engine is a beautiful piece of machinery, but she works more than half power and the sooner the 15 inch lifts replace the 11 inch the better. Even now the water in the 30 fathom level is running like a mill race.</p>
<p>There are facilities for washing ore following the natural declivity of the ground southwards towards the creek and part of the water is lifted by the engine house from which an aqueduct [launder] leads it to a large tank affording a stream to the workings on the northwest side towards the Bon Accord property. When the crushing engine is at work a great saving will be effected and much orey ground will then be able to be raised at a paying price, which it would not now pay to reduce by ‘bucking’. [To buck is to steep in an alkaline lye.]</p>
<p>Another drawing engine is soon expected and the Directors are contemplating sending for another powerful pump engine.</p>
<p>The agreement with the Patent Copper Company is for them to be supplied with 30,000 tons of ore annually, if it is raised, but the Burra Burra Company remains free to dispose of ores above 35% as they see fit. The ore has turned out to be unexpectedly rich and, after it is washed, much above 35%. Mr Walters of the Patent Copper Co. says the clause in the agreement refers to the ores before washing, but the Burra Burra Directors say it refers to ores after washing and have sold 1,500 tons to Mr Penny’s smelting works at Apoinga and 200 tons to the Yatala works at higher prices than Mr Walters would give. The Patent Copper Co. has rented a piece of ground at Port Adelaide where a wharf is being formed to receive coal and the ore they ship to England and it is said they intend to erect furnaces there. They also have barges of their own to take coal to Port Wakefield, which is only 25 miles from the Burra Burra over a level plain and to bring down all the copper in return.</p>
<p>The Government has laid out the town of Port Wakefield, which will be offered for sale next month, together with waterfront strips 400 ft wide on which wharves may be erected.</p>
<p>Messrs Schneider’s Swansea Works are receiving ore from their branch here. It works this way. Mr Walters, instead of keeping his portion of the copper metal, gives all of it to the Burra Burra Company, in anticipation of ore, taking, in fact, ore in payment for their share of the copper. This is a double advantage to the Patent Copper Company; it enables them to furnish the Burra Burra Company with the full quantity of the copper they stipulated to deliver the first year, notwithstanding that their furnaces are but half complete, but it also furnished a supply of the rich Burra Burra ores to the Swansea works without having to compete with other smelters for its purchase. Mr Walters has shown his reputation to be fully justified by his achievement in setting up the works with all the difficulties entailed in operating in a country where everything had to be created for such a novel undertaking and that at a place 100 miles into the interior.</p>
<p>The Yatala Smelting-works near Port Adelaide were built at a cost of £8,000, where the hot blast principle is applied by a small steam engine, are advertised to be sold by auction; want of capital is said to be the cause. The proprietors profess to be able to smelt at a cost of £10 per ton of copper with a profit. Yatala copper is favourably reported on from India and China.</p>
<p>Messrs Penny’s smelting-works at Apoinga, 20 miles south of Burra Burra are completed. They lie in well wooded country, but the supply of ore is as yet irregular. Should the Emu Plains deposits prove to be great they may do well, though the Patent Copper Company might then erect furnaces there themselves.</p>
<p>Another small smelter is working on the Bremer, in the Mt Barker district. They have an agreement with the South Australian Company to smelt their ores from the Kanmantoo Mine for two years on terms which, it is said, pays the smelters very well. [Continued 24 January.]</p>

<p>[The editor comments on the item immediately above. He considers the writer has shown great shrewdness and intelligence. And ‘there is unfortunately too much truth in [his] sarcasm’ when he says [mines were abandoned as unprofitable, because shiploads of malachite and red oxide were not found above the water level.’]</p>

<p>[The writer describes how the Emu Plains mineral lands were sold and how the Burra Burra Company acquired significant holdings there, though they do not intend to develop their portion until more labour becomes available. At present they could employ another 200 at the Burra Burra Mine, if that number were available.]</p>
<p>Princess Royal is at a standstill with extraordinary indications visible in all directions. None of the shafts down to the 30 fathoms have cut anything. The shareholders are disheartened and the various mining Captains sent there to report are at their wits’ end. ‘To all appearance it is not the present generation who are to profit by this property.’</p>

<p>North Terrace Foundry. Having been attracted by the appearance of two large cylinders outside we were politely invited to inspect the interior of their foundry by one of the Messrs Wyatt. [Among other items] we saw some castings for two powerful pumps about to be employed at the Burra Burra Mines and said to be capable of raising from 30,000 to 40,000 gallons of water per hour. The largest pieces were 11 ft long and 14 inches diameter, the inner surfaces being accurately bored. The component parts of a pump ordered by the Patent Copper Co. next took our attention. The double valves and elbow-pipes were choice specimens of the founder’s art. [A number of other items are then described.] In the principal workshop there was a large iron safe and fireproof bookcase in course of completion for the offices of the SA Mining Association.</p>

<p>Kooringa Political Meeting</p>
<p>On 3 March a crowd of almost all the adult male population of the townships gathered at the Burra Hotel when it was known that G.S. Kingston has arrived. Mr Lang also attended and the chair was taken by Dr Bull.</p>
<p>W.R. Mortlock proposed Mr William Lang as a suitable candidate and Mr John Wiltshire seconded the motion.</p>
<p>William Paxton proposed G.S. Kingston and was seconded by H. Chambers.</p>
<p>When called upon Mr Lang expounded on his political views, which were most liberal.</p>
<p>Mr Kingston said he was not aware of any of his actions deserving their disapprobation and he alluded to a placard he had seen that referred to a ‘purse-proud Burra Director’. He did not think he merited this insinuation and said his principles were rather similar to those of Mr Lang.</p>
<p>There was a rather stormy discussion between the ministers of religion who were present, relative to the Government grant in aid of religion, which both the candidates were utterly opposed to.</p>
<p>A show of hands indicated a large majority in favour of Mr Lang.</p>
<p>A committee has been established among the tradesmen of the township to secure the return of Mr Lang free of expense. He has said he will not canvass a single voter or spend a shilling on his election.</p>

<p>Kooringa Election</p>
<p>On 6 March a crowd of between 200 and 300 gathered at the Burra Hotel. Mr W.R. Mortlock was voted into the chair and he outlined the reason for the meeting; to discuss the merits of the two candidates for the coming election.</p>
<p>Dr Bull said that at last their town with a population of more than 4,000 and the second largest in the colony was at last to have a candidate for itself.</p>
<p>Dr Bull asked what merits had Mr Kingston, judging from his speech the previous Monday. His address amounted to little more than an echo of Mr Lang’s principles except on the question of the ballot, and on that he has no opinion at all. Or at least not the courage to declare an opinion. But no Burra Director, whatever superior claims he might have to Mr Kingston, will be the best member to represent our interests.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mine is a great, and astounding, and a wealthy fact, but we have no intention of allowing the Burra Directors to interfere with our duties or our interests, or to monopolise the right to represent this place and our interests. I maintain that the Burra Directors have never consulted any other interests than their own, and they have no claim on our gratitude. What have they done for the town? They have a property returning 800% per annum and have let their workmen live in underground holes. In England any comparable company would always have provided suitable housing at a reasonable rent. They have only now set about establishing a slaughterhouse. Remember their action at the sale of land at Redruth where they sought to obstruct working men from acquiring a little bit of freehold. Who was present there to act on their behalf, but Mr Kingston? I move:</p>
<p>‘That it is the opinion of this meeting that Mt Kingston, from his conduct in connexion with the electors and working men of the Burra, is not entitled to their support.’</p>
<p>Mr Taylor of the Aberdeen Hotel seconded the motion and said they should maintain their rights and fear no intimidation. They needed one who would protect the rights of the poor man as well as the rich and he believed they had found such a man in William Lang. The motion was carried.</p>
<p>Mr J. Wiltshire then proposed ‘That Mr William Lang Esq., from his extensive political knowledge and ability, and also from his liberal opinions, is entitled to the support of the electors of this District.’</p>
<p>Seconded by J.S. Barnett and carried. Mr Pearce, tailor, of Kooringa also spoke at length in support of Mr Lang.</p>

<p>Our Roads [Editorial]</p>
<p>The want of rain has so reduced the available feed that the SA Mining Association is presently unable to get their ores to port. Several furnaces at the Patent Copper Company’s work are out of service for want of wood. We must hope that the dry summer is not followed by a very wet winter that will also prevent traffic. Is it not clear that railroads are essential for our prosperity? We are sure the capital could be raised.</p>

<p>Burra Money Orders</p>
<p>A deputation waited on the Directors and Secretary of the Association on their recent visit to the Mine to ask that the Association adopt such measures as would relieve private parties from the necessity of issuing small money orders. This practice has been extensive and created a system open to extensive and easy fraud. The Association has agreed to issue 5/- orders so as to supply the want of coins in circulation in the town. It is understood that in the future all private orders will be refused in transactions. This will make for greater safety as in the past the holder of an order had a doubtful legal claim against the drawer. The drawer in many cases being an agent or a servant made seeking redress more difficult. We have long felt that the banks have failed in their obligations to the people from whom their wealth is derived, in not sweeping away the whole system of money orders.</p>
<p>10 April 1851, page 1</p>
<p>Notice. Burnett Nathan, Navarino House, Hindley Street advises that on account of having in the past received many worthless orders in place of cash, he will in future take only orders drawn on the SA Mining Association or on the Patent Copper Company. He also requests all his agents to stop drawing petty orders on him.</p>
<p>10 April 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Burra Money Orders. We trust that all others will follow the example of Mr Burnett Nathan in ceasing to authorise small money orders previously issued on him by his agents in the Burra.</p>

<p>MINING IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA from the London Mining Journal</p>
<p>[The writer begins with a description of Port Wakefield and the sale of land there and then moves on to the sale of agricultural land and then the mineral lands of Emu Flats. These are all points noted already, as they occurred. He does add a couple of interesting points:</p>
<p>Discoverers of minerals went to extraordinary lengths to hide their discoveries so that there would be no extra bidders forcing up the price of the land when it was auctioned. Sometimes green rocks were painted over, or a flock of sheep were camped on the site, or a hut could even be erected over the discovery.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra proprietors paid premium prices for allotments at Emu Flats even though it was unlikely they would develop a major copper mine there. They were convinced that the ore from there would be useful as a flux in smelting the Burra ores and they were also concerned that, with a limited supply of miners, the development by others of a major mine would reduce their ability to raise ore at the Burra Burra Mine.]</p>
<p>Copper Smelting in SA [An extract from the London Mining Journal]</p>
<p>From the latest reports from Australia it appears that ‘tough cake’ copper is offered for sale at the offices of the SA Company. A ship sailing for Singapore carried 246 tons of copper:</p>
<p>5257 tasks</p>
<p>152 blocks</p>
<p>4369 ingots</p>
<p>76 pigs</p>
<p>3900 ciles</p>
<p>These came from the Kooringa, Apoinga, Yatala and Kanmantoo smelters.</p>
<p>Assays in Calcutta say it is reckoned to be the purest ever brought to that market and equal to Russian ingot. At this early period the colony dares to compete, and that successfully, with the parent country in the Indian market.</p>
<p>[The writer then goes on to complain that copper is not being smelted in England and cannot understand why not.]</p>

<p>Mr Lang and the Kooringa Representation</p>
<p>Letter from William Lang RM, MD to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, 13 March 1851.</p>
<p>You have probably seen in the Adelaide papers the requisition calling upon me to stand in the coming election. I have accepted the call to stand for the Burra District in the Legislative Council. I am not aware that my position as the Resident Magistrate of the Murray District is any impediment to this course, but it seems to be desirable that I should ascertain my proper footing. I therefore ask you to obtain the opinion of the Law Officers on this point and would be obliged by your favouring me with it at your earliest convenience.</p>
<p>[Lang then cites other cases that might have some relevance to this question.]</p>
<p>Letter from Charles Sturt, Colonial Secretary, to the Resident Magistrate, Burra Burra, 21 March 1851.</p>
<p>I have the honour, by the Lieutenant Governor’s direction, to inform you that you are of course quite at liberty to follow your own judgement in this matter; but that, as the Lieutenant Governor holds your residence at the Burra to be indispensable to the proper performance of your official duties, His Excellency will consider you to have vacated your office of Resident Magistrate by an election for a seat in the Legislature.</p>
<p>William Lang RM, MD to the Hon. the Colonial Secretary, 28 March 1851.</p>
<p>As I never contemplated the alternative of your reply, I have ceased to be a candidate, and the independent electors are now looking out for another.</p>
<p>[Lang goes on to outline why he considered that a seat in the Legislature would not have been incompatible with the carrying out of his duties as Resident Magistrate. He also outlines his qualifications and experience in England that would have fitted him for the role.]</p>
<p>‘For myself personally I have no interested purpose to answer; no paltry ambition to gratify; and I can assure you with great truth I do not at all regret that I am relieved from a position which would have been attended with much trouble and anxiety.’</p>
<p>17 April 1851, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association held its annual meeting yesterday. All the former Directors were re-elected, with the exception that Captain Hall has replaced Mr C.S. Penny, who resigned. Voting was as follows:</p>
<p>William Paxton 277</p>
<p>William Sanders 261</p>
<p>William Allen 254</p>
<p>George Hall 251</p>
<p>William Peacock 248</p>
<p>M. Featherstonhaugh 172</p>
<p>N.P. LeBair 72</p>
<p>Arthur Blyth 46</p>
<p>Henry Francis Penny 18</p>
<p>John Bullock 18</p>
<p>In the past half year the Association has raised nearly 13,000 tons of ore, which have been estimated to average 21 cwt. The quantity would have been greater, but the occasional influx of water prevented the continuous working of the pitches. The balance of profits for the half year, after paying two dividends of 200% is £47,673-3-7. How far our economy is dependent on the success of the mine can be judged from the statement that £170,780-17-0 has been disbursed during the year ending 31 March last, so that with the dividends more than a quarter of a million pounds has, through the instrumentality of this Association, been placed in circulation among a population of 70,000 souls. After taking everything into account the Association cites a divisible balance of £61,000. But given the difficulty of converting stock into money during the winter months, the Directors say they cannot yet fix the rate of the dividends for the next half year, but at the usual time for paying dividends they will consider it their duty to declare as large an amount as the Company’s position will safely warrant.</p>
<p>Considerable excitement had been shown before the meeting on account of the effects of the disastrous season. The drought is such that the cartage of ore has been virtually stopped, with but 70 tons on the road and the Patent Copper Company has but six furnaces out of 19 at work because they are unable to get fuel. Regardless of this situation the Captain of the Mine has declared ‘that the prospects were never more cheering than they now are’. And observers have been reassured by the fact that profits are only £3,000 less than on 30 March 1850.</p>
<p>The colony can be reassured by these results and with 7,757 tons of ore and 144 tons of copper on hand within the colony there is no fear of a stoppage in the circulation of money arising from any failure in the operations of the Association.</p>
<p>The manufactured article is being sent largely to India and a consequence is that Indian produce has become cheaper here than in the other colonies, because of our greater facility in making payment.</p>
<p>The number of men and boys employed is 1,042.</p>
<p>There are only 24 employed at Karkulto Mines and the Pompurne Estate (Emu Plains) remains undeveloped. The colony would benefit from the development of both these estates, which want only men and capital to release their buried treasures.</p>

<p>Kooringa Election</p>
<p>The number of claims registered [to vote] is 428. The number of objections sent in amount to 170. New claims 2.</p>
<p>The objections include all the SA Mining Association Officers and the Patent Copper Company’s workmen, who pay no rent and also the Company’s tenants, who pay only 3/- a week and so under £10 p.a. A Court of Revision will be held on 28 April.</p>
<p>23 April 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa Nuisances</p>
<p>The residents of Kooringa have good reason to thank Sergeant Major McCulloch, whose actions have seen the end to several long standing nuisances. In one instance not more than 200 yards from the courthouse a butcher was keeping 20 pigs in a cellar, wallowing in the most abominably filthy litter imaginable, arising from the pigs being fed with offal of every description in this nest of pestilence.</p>
<p>Reputed Dismissal</p>
<p>It is stated that a young man named Hosken has lately been discharged by Captain Edward Phillips, from work at the Mine, allegedly because his father signed some objections to voters at Kooringa, of whom Captain Phillips happened to be one. We cannot believe that the Directors would sanction such a proceeding after the liberal way in which they expressed themselves to miners recently on the subject of voting. We hope soon to hear that they have rectified this disgraceful occurrence or that the whole affair has been misunderstood or grossly misstated.</p>
<p>Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa, before W. Lang, Resident Magistrate. 15 April.</p>
<p>William Balman was charged by William Simmons with illegally selling a stockyard, the property of the complainant. The Magistrate advised them to settle out of court and this was eventually done.</p>
<p>Samuel Bignell, wheelwright, applied for a summons against John Owen for illegally taking possession of a cart, the property of Bignell, and placing it in the public pound. Mr Grant, the Clerk of the Court, said the cart was only impounded to keep it safe until a partnership dispute between the parties could be resolved. His Worship granted the summons.</p>
<p>17 April</p>
<p>William Stuart, butcher was charged by Sergeant-major McCulloch with keeping pigs in a stye in the creek, thereby creating a nuisance in the neighbourhood. Stuart admitted the charge, but said if he were not allowed to keep the pigs he would be obliged to give up his business. His Worship said he liked a piece of pork, but the defendant could not be allowed to endanger the health of the inhabitants. As this was a first offence, Stuart was not fined on condition he removed the nuisance and paid court costs of 16/-.</p>
<p>19 April</p>
<p>Several Germans attended the court today to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen for the purposes of naturalization.</p>
<p>His Worship said the Court of Revision would be held on 28 April.</p>
<p>26 April 1851, page 2</p>
<p>Kooringa Election</p>
<p>Latter from Samuel Stocks [Sen.] to Mr John Smith, butcher of Kooringa, 9 April 1851.</p>
<p>[In rather elaborate prose Mr Stocks thanks Smith for the information that his cause in the coming election has great support. He admits that his candidacy gains much from his late son’s popularity. He also says that he will not be visiting Kooringa until he can come as the District’s representative.]</p>
<p>Court of Revision. The Government has decided that because Me Lang came forward as a candidate, he has disqualified himself from sitting in a Court of Revision. Mr Dashwood has been appointed to convene the Court of Revision in Kooringa.</p>
<p>29 April 1851, page 2</p>
<p>The Great Exhibition in London</p>
<p>SA will not be omitted for the display. The Directors of the SA Mining Association have decided to send specimens of ore. The collection has been open to rhe public prior to its shipment to London. The most striking specimen is a block of blue carbonate, which has been named the punchbowl, having a diameter of 2 ft 6 inches by 1 ft 9 inches and weighing between 2 and 3 cwt. The natural hollow in the centre is studded with the most brilliant crystals of different shades, which have the most beautiful effect.</p>
<p>30 April 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa Concerts</p>
<p>George Bennett’s concert at the Burra Hotel on 25 April was well attended.</p>
<p>Items mentioned are:</p>
<p>Old Colonist’s Song</p>
<p>Adelaide Polka</p>
<p>Jetty Treff’s song Trab, Trab, Trab</p>
<p>Madame Francesco Allen sang Mother’s Farewell from ‘Norma’ [Rapturously reviewed.]</p>
<p>Mr Bambrick’s playing of the flute was admired.</p>
<p>C. Walsh sang Old Colonist’s Song (His voice and technique much improved after a sojourn in Adelaide.)</p>
<p>A gentleman amateur sang The Maids of Merry England and Merrily Rolls the Mill</p>
<p>Mr Bambrick’s second concert on 26 April saw Madame Allen quite triumphant. [Corrected 7 May to Madame Otto.]</p>
<p>The third concert is looked forward to this week.</p>
<p>The Patent Copper Company is presently operating only five furnaces, chiefly due to the lack of pasturage making it impossible for the bullock drays to bring in wood. Many men are unemployed in Burra as a consequence and trade there is very dull.</p>
<p>The Court of Revision. Mr Dashwood arrived last Friday and with Drs Bull and Chambers, held a court fixing 6 May as the day for a Court of Revision, thus annulling the date of 28 April set by Mr Lang. Mr Dashwood left on Saturday morning for Clare.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>A model of the Mine is on show at Kooringa. It is acknowledged to be one of the most complete yet accomplished and was built by Henry Geyer, a German miner. The surface and underground workings are shown and the miners and Captains engaged in their activities. The engine is at work and the horses doing their duty at the whims. After this week we believe it is Geyer’s intention to take the model to Adelaide, exhibiting it at the towns along the way at a charge of 1/- each.</p>
<p>Cattle Stealing. Instances of cattle stealing have already occurred in the neighbourhood. The police are on the alert and cases will be prosecuted rigorously. We should be glad to hear that a competent Inspector of Brands had been appointed to the new Slaughter-house, which is now nearly completed and will shortly be opened.</p>
<p>1 May 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Mining in South Australia (From the London Mining Journal’s correspondent. Concluded from 14 April.)</p>
<p>[The writer continues from the previous article on 14 April with a digression on the problems posed by the land sale as far as the banking community was concerned and the potential disastrous result of taking £30,000 out of circulation in the colony. Having explained how the danger was averted, he continues:]</p>
<p>The large sum obtained from this sale will bring out 2,000 migrants, relieving England of her superabundant children, and adding so many additional consumers of British manufactures to this population.</p>
<p>At the Burra Mine the last six weeks’ ‘take’ have produced 5,000 tons of ore from 10 to 45% produce. The crushing machine has arrived and will soon be at work. This will allow the opening of a number of pitches in the surface levels, which have hitherto not been touched because of the expense of ‘bucking’ the stuff down.</p>
<p>At the Patent Copper Company the large chimney and the second row of furnaces are fast approaching completion.</p>
<p>The ships which bring out emigrants take copper from here to India on their return; cutting out trade for the Swansea smelters.</p>
<p>[The author goes on to write of the Reedy Creek (Tungkillo) Mine and of some gold from the upper Torrens Valley. He mentions an engine breakage has allowed the Kapunda Mine to become flooded; a case of penny wise and pound foolish in purchasing an old engine for the job. He then writes of mines at Paringa and in the Strathalbyn area and concludes with a report that the Royal Mining Company’s shares are now unsaleable.</p>
<p>2 May 1851, page 1</p>
<p>Advertisement. The SA Mining Association calls for tenders by 15 May for renting the new Public Slaughterhouse at Kooringa. The tenant will have the right to terminate the tenancy at any time on two months’ notice and must abide by the rules that may from time to time be made to regulate the operations of the slaughterhouse. The tenant will be at liberty to impose charges not exceeding:</p>
<p>Great cattle 3/- per head</p>
<p>Calves 1/- per head</p>
<p>Sheep 4d per head</p>
<p>All necessary tools and implements to be found by the tenant.</p>

<p>Kooringa Money Orders</p>
<p>The changes to the money order system at Kooringa have been introduced with minimum fuss. There was some small difficulty in procuring sufficient gold and silver until the small orders of the Burra Mining Company were issued.</p>
<p>Business Hours. We are glad to see moves among the assistant drapers and grocers at Burra to reduce the present long hours of business. We also applaud the disposition of employers to support the young men in this matter.</p>
<p>Resident Magistrate’s Court</p>
<p>There has been little action due to the indisposition of Mr Lang.</p>
<p>Sergeant McCulloch charged Stephen Johnson, butcher, with shooting bullocks in the stockyard at Kooringa and he was fined 5/- when brought before G. Bull Esq.</p>
<p>J.W. Powell, chemist of Kooringa, reports that a letter from England tells that a fellow named Lamas, formerly of the SA Mounted Police, has been pretending knowledge and friendship of settlers to gain access to certain families at home. Not only has he done so, but he has also then slandered the colonists by reporting to their friends or family false reports of their behaviour. He represented Mr Powell as having taken to drinking and gambling.</p>
<p>‘A Householder’ writes from Kooringa 4 May to complain about the small number of police at Kooringa. There are only six police in the town. Only the previous night there had been four robberies from stores, with only on man apprehended. Such robberies the writer says are a daily occurrence. At least six more police are required.</p>
<p>‘I need scarcely add that, through intimidation, most of these vagabonds escape punishment; the tradesmen fear being mobbed if they prosecute any of these cutthroats.’</p>
<p>9 May 1851, page 2</p>
<p>Court of Revision</p>
<p>When our special reporter arrived the town was abuzz with excitement over the coming election. The Court was held in the small and very inconvenient Kooringa Court House as a matter of form, but almost immediately adjourned to the large room at the Burra Hotel. Mr Dashwood presided, assisted by Messrs Bull &amp; Chambers.</p>
<p>A group of four persons, headed by an elector named Taylor had objected to the 168 person being enrolled to vote.</p>
<p>Mr Mann appeared for Mr Kingston and the other 167.</p>
<p>The objections fell into two types:</p>
<p>Objections to parties who dwelt in houses of the Burra Burra Company, where the houses had a greater value than £10 p.a., but without paying rent.</p>
<p>Objections to parties who dwelt in houses of the Burra Burra Company, where the houses had a greater value than £10 p.a., but the rent paid amounted to less than £10 p.a.</p>
<p>After some discussion it was orders that the parties lodging the objection must appear or their objections must fail.</p>
<p>As the names were read over and no one came to sustain the objections, al the names were retained upon the list.</p>
<p>SA Elections: Mr Mildred at Burra</p>
<p>Mr Mildred the candidate for Stanley &amp; Gawler entered the room at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Dr Bull was voted into the chair and Mr Mildred spent some time describing his views on civil and religious liberty, education, no state aid to religion, the ballot, universal suffrage, triennial Parliaments, and state economy.</p>
<p>Mr Mortlock moved that Mr Henry Mildred was a fit and proper person to represent and that he be requested to become a candidate for the District of the Burra.’</p>
<p>Mr Taylor gave a rambling speech in seconding the motion.</p>
<p>Mr Mann spoke to comment on both the seconder and Mr Mildred. He accused the seconder of inconsistency in supporting universal suffrage and then objecting to the names of 168 persons on the roll. Mr Mildred, he said, had not referred to Mr Kingston’s position while outlining his own and that was because Mr Kingston’s liberal views had long been known. Why was he now an eleventh hour candidate? He had failed to explain this and that made him unsuited as a candidate. One thing alone rendered Mr Kingston the better candidate; Mr Kingston was a large Burra proprietor and Director; Mr Mildred had no interest or knowledge of the Mine. The prosperity of the people of Burra was synonymous with the success of the Burra Burra Mine. Knowledge of the Mine was essential for their representative, etc, etc.</p>
<p>The Chairman interrupted to ask if it was his intention to propose an amendment.</p>
<p>Dr Bull eventually ruled Mr Mann was not in order.</p>
<p>Mr Pollock [sic: for Pollitt] the Anglican minister then asked some questions while Mr Mann retired to fetch Mr Kingston.</p>
<p>After an interval Mr Kingston appeared with Mr Mann, Captain Finniss and other friends.</p>
<p>Mr Kingston said his position was well known, but he would answer any questions. He was surprised the Mr Mildred had allowed Kingston’s actions to have been misrepresented without attempting to contradict the statements that had been made. The meeting then dissolved into uproar and squabbling for about half an hour.</p>
<p>Mr Mortlock then rose and asked Kingston as to his opinion on the right to discoverers of mineral wealth to a reward.</p>
<p>Kingston said he thought the present law unfair, but its remedy was a more difficult question. If elected ‘he would use every effort to procure for the discoverers of our mineral treasures, and particularly for miners, his just reward.’</p>
<p>This was followed by loud and protracted cheering, in the midst of which Dr Bull vacated the chair in favour of Mr Mortlock.</p>
<p>Dr Bull then asked Kingston if he was a supporter ‘of that tyrannous and oppressive imposition called the Miners’ Relief Fund, which takes 6d per week away from that which the miner earns by the sweat of his brow, to pay an officer appointed by yourself, and which refuses him the right to have&hellip;’</p>
<p>Here the storm burst and little of what the speaker said could be heard. He was heard to say that he had the names of 100 miners opposed to the fund.</p>
<p>He was called upon to name some and he named a miner recently dead. ‘A living witness.’ Was called for as the tumult increased.</p>
<p>Dr Bull rushed to the top of the table and at the top of his voice said to Mr Kingston, ‘I say it is robbery; I say it is a swindle.’</p>
<p>Mr Kingston immediately retorted ‘You are a liar.’</p>
<p>This brought the meeting to an abrupt conclusion. Mr Mortlock vacated the chair. Dr Bull disappeared amidst the angry crowd and Mr Kingston retired with his friends, his supporters greeting him with hearty cheers.</p>

<p>Railroads. (Editorial)</p>
<p>[Another long article pushed the desirability of borrowing money to construct the railway to Port Adelaide and to Gawler, with the latter extended in due course to the Burra Burra Mines. Considerable details and costs are gone into.]</p>
<p>12 May 1851, page 3</p>
<p>SA Election. A public meeting was held at the Burra Hotel on Thursday evening to hear Mr Mildred deliver his political views. About 300 persons attended and Mr Mortlock took the chair. The proposition that Mr Mildred was the man to represent this district in the New Council was greeted with tremendous applause.</p>
<p>Resident Magistrate’s Court, Thursday</p>
<p>Informations were laid by George Bull Esq. JP against Captain Finniss and G.S. Kingston Esq. with reference to their conduct at the public meeting on Tuesday evening. We are informed that summonses have been issued for their appearance at the Court on 17 May.</p>
<p>14 May 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Bath’s Grand Lottery was drawn in the large room of the Burra Hotel on 5 May, when 40 prizes were handed over to the fortunate winners. About 150 people attended. Mr Kingston attended for a short time and was enthusiastically cheered.</p>
<p>SA Elections. It is generally reported that Mr Stocks is about to visit Kooringa as a candidate for the district. Whether he is likely to succeed in his political objective or not, there is every reason to believe he would receive a hearty welcome.</p>
<p>Early Closing. The shopkeepers of Burra have met the wishes of their assistants and will close their shops at 7 p.m. as from 15 May.</p>
<p>Burglaries. The house of Mr John Higgs was forcibly entered on Sunday evening while the family was at church. Among items stolen was Mr Higgs cash-box, which fortunately only held an order for £3.</p>
<p>Mr Thomas Bath has, in the past three weeks, been robbed in a similar manner of £100.</p>
<p>It is apparent from these and other offences that an organised gang is operating in the neighbourhood. While the diligence of Sergeant-Major McCulloch cannot be doubted, the want of sufficient police at Burra is deplorable.</p>
<p>Postal Arrangement. People at the Karkulto Mine are complaining that their postal delivery is at Apoinga, six miles off. This could easily be remedied by establishing a post office at the Emu Inn, where the mail conveyance stops to change horses. The non delivery of newspapers is especially felt.</p>
<p>15 May 1851, page 2</p>
<p>Destructive Floods at Burra</p>
<p>Last Monday the tributary to the Burra Creek, which runs through part of Kooringa, became suddenly charged with water to such a degree that many of the inhabitants thought that two waterspouts had burst over the town threatening its total destruction. Up to the latest reports the mine had received no damage, but storekeepers and other residents, especially those living in the creek, have sustained great losses, running, it is said, into many thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>One report at 11 p.m. said that the flood had collected at the Smelting House Bridge and all in the creek – that is those living in the excavated houses from thence down to Ware’s, have now turned out. The church schoolroom has been opened to receive them.</p>
<p>Another report said that at about 5 p.m. two waterspouts [i.e. cloudbursts] broke over the township and in less than two minutes the streets were a sheet of water, carrying everything before it – horses, carts, pigs, fences etc. Now at 7 p.m. the shops are all closed and all is confusion. Women are running in water up to their knees from the creek, crying for their children. Water is four feet high in Thompson &amp; Boord’s shop and the same in Benjamin’s. The street presents the appearance of a rough sea. We have done all we could to render assistance to those unfortunates in the creek. It is not known yet if lives have been lost, but the destruction of property will amount to thousands.</p>
<p>Another report:</p>
<p>‘This afternoon I have witnessed such a flood as I little expected to see here. All the garden fence was washed away, and a heavy dray was not only washed from the garden, but carried down to Boord’s stores. Several of the stores are full of water. Mr Boord, I fear, will be a heavy loser. His cellar was five or six feet deep in water, and some 30 to 40 pigs are gone. Thomson and Kekwick are also among the unfortunates, and the creek huts are all being driven down the stream. If it had happened in the night, many lives would have been lost. Some steps should now be taken to prevent people from living in the creek. We – I mean our own houses – have happily escaped without any serious damage.’</p>
<p>The paper’s own correspondent wrote:</p>
<p>‘Kooringa, Monday Evening, 12th May, 1851.</p>
<p>We are all afloat here, the heavy rains which have fallen the last few days, assisted by the immense drain last night and to-day, hade deluged us; Commercial-street (the principal one in the township) has all the appearance of a huge river running through the township into the Burra creek with the force of Niagara! Empty casks, large logs of wood, and even a dray floated down the street at a railway pace. The Creek presents a fearful sight; the water rose in half an hour to an unprecedented height, and those occupying huts excavated in its banks are at this moment floating their furniture out of the holes they have lived in. Live stock, in the shape of fowls, ducks, and pigs, are going down the Creek for the fastest; and men are seen carrying away little pigs, women and children in all directions, to escape the impending fate of all those who for want of assistance must await the dreaded result of this formidable overflow. It is reported that an infant belonging to someone living in the creek has met with a watery grave, but of this I can only speak from hearsay. The goods in the stores and cellars of several tradesmen have already suffered much damage. It is estimated by the manager of Messrs Boord Brothers’ establishment at Kooringa that their firm will suffer in this instance a loss amounting to upwards of £300. I can only account for the sudden rush of water on this occasion by the hardness of the surface land, arising from the long absence of rain and the consequent impenetrability of the high grounds in the district, thus causing the waters falling on the surrounding hills to flow almost undiminished down to the valley in which the town is situated.’</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. Charles Bonney held an inquest at the Cross Keys, Para Plains, on 21 May on the body of David Bryce. Joseph Bowman, carter, said Bryce had been riding on the pole of a dray loaded with nine bags of copper ore, weighing about half a ton and drawn by six bullocks. Witness noticed him missing from his seat and went back to find him on the ground. He breathed a few times, but did not speak. Deceased had had a few glasses of drink, but was not intoxicated. He had not had sleep for several days, as he had to watch his bullocks. Noticing he was sleepy the witness had advised him to ride in the dray, but he had not done so. Thomas Scott landlord of the Lass of Gowrie at Para Plains said the witness Bowman and the deceased had called at the house on the night of the accident and had several glasses of whisky. The verdict was Accidental death.</p>

<p>SA Elections: Mr Stocks at the Burra</p>
<p>Mr Stocks arrived at the Burra on Friday 16 May. A public meeting was held on Saturday in the large room at the Burra Hotel. Mr Stocks was enthusiastically greeted and Mr Gumer of Aberdeen was voted into the chair.</p>
<p>[Not certainly identified, but probably Richard Gummer.]</p>
<p>In introducing Mr Stocks the Chairman said that Mr Stocks had not intended to address a public gathering, but had agreed to do so in compliance with their wishes. There will be a public meeting on Monday evening.</p>
<p>He began by extolling the success of the colony in such a short time: ‘A few years ago it was inhabited only by natives and look at its high and rising position now. They needed to be careful in laying the political foundations of the country, having seen both the excellences and the defects of the mother-country.</p>
<p>[He went on at some length and some of his points were:</p>
<p>He was in favour of universal suffrage.</p>
<p>He favoured voting by ballot.</p>
<p>He had seen most of the Directors of the SA Mining Association and had been assured they would not influence a single vote and he had assurances from Mr Walters of the Patent Copper Company to the same effect.</p>
<p>He favoured steps for the intellectual improvement of the people</p>
<p>Steps needed to be taken to promote education of children in the bush.</p>
<p>He was a strong supporter of Sunday schools.]</p>
<p>At one point he said ‘The working man wants plenty of work.’ This was met with a retort ‘No, we want plenty of money.’</p>
<p>David Graham spoke briefly in support of Mr Stocks.</p>
<p>Accident/Obituary. A fatal accident at the Burra Mine has resulted in the death of a miner named William James. A large stone fell from the bucket while landing and fell to the bottom of the shaft. It struck James, killing him instantly. [This death does not appear in the SA Deaths CD.]</p>

<p>Tom Porter was committed to prison for failing to pay a fine of £5 for assaulting Dr Bull.</p>
<p>[Corrected in the Register of 5 June to a fine of £1.]</p>
<p>Margaret Watson, who appeared with a pair of black eyes, was charged with being drunk and disorderly on the Sabbath. She pleaded guilty and His Worship dismissed the charge with a severe reprimand after she promised to be more orderly and abstemious.</p>
<p>Mrs Trenary said she had been looking after a poor woman by the name of Betsy James who was afflicted in mind. Now she was moving to Adelaide and asked what course she should adopt with reference to the poor woman. His Worship said a certificate from a doctor was needed before he could commit the woman to care in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Mr Jones, tailor, obtained a summons against Charles Mosely, his neighbour, for using abusing language calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.</p>
<p>Captain Bath of the Princess Royal Mine wished to ascertain if anything further had been done in the case of some Miners v. the Princess Royal Mining Company, before he went to Adelaide. His Worship said he could not account for the actions of Mr Fisher on behalf of the company. He had asked for several adjournments. His Worship suggested that if the Company agreed to let him settle the matter in dispute, he thought he could see a way clear to do so amicably.</p>
<p>Mr Rogers, mason, obtained a summons against Mr Stace of the Southampton Arms, Redruth, for the balance of account on work done.</p>
<p>13 May</p>
<p>Charles Mosely appeared to the summons of Edward Jones of Kooringa, for calling him a common informer, and also charging him with having robbed his lodge. His Worship reprimanded both men for their unneighbourly conduct towards one another and in the hope they would in future heed his advice, imposed a small fine of 5/- plus 31/- expenses. Each party appeared to leave the court considering himself the conquering hero.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held on Tuesday last at the Miners’ Arms on the body of William James.

<p>SA Election: Mr Stocks at the Burra</p>
<p>Several hundred people attended Mr Stocks&rsquo; second public meeting in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Monday. G.W.R. Mortlock took the chair.</p>
<p>Mr Stocks rose and held before him a large poster with an extract from Mr Ayers’ letter to the officers and miners of the Burra Mine, expressing the desire of the Board that everyone in the employ of the company should exercise his own judgement and consult his own wishes only in voting in the forthcoming election. His major points were perhaps:</p>
<p>A strong supporter of universal suffrage.</p>
<p>Supported triennial Parliaments.</p>
<p>Many laws need revision: one being the prohibition on distilling.</p>
<p>For free trade.</p>
<p>It would be better if all the money from land sales went on promoting immigration, as it is the lifeblood of progress.</p>
<p>The assistance of the state must be engaged in promoting education in the remote districts of the colony.</p>
<p>Taxation should be kept as low as possible. The money is better in the people’s pockets.</p>
<p>He favoured local district control of the police force.</p>
<p>He hoped (and believed) that education would reduce the need for so many police.</p>
<p>He repeated his assurances that both Captain Roach and Mr Walters had assured him that they would do nothing that could be construed in any way to arise from malice of ill-feeling in consequence of the conscientious exercise of the franchise. They agree that they have no right and no desire to interfere with the political rights of the people.</p>
<p>A show of hands indicated strong support for Government grants in aid of education and strongly against any grants to aid religion.</p>
<p>Mr Stocks asked if they thought any elector committing felony should be struck off the electoral list for life. A majority agreed.</p>
<p>He said that shortly before the Burra mine was discovered the Association’s funds were reduced to £70 and his son had induced them to go on; pledging £70 of his own before they should give up the search in which the Burra Mine was discovered. He said if one man had a better claim on them than another it was the father of Samuel Stocks Jnr, ‘whom you all respected, and some of you loved’.</p>
<p>‘It would indeed be an honour to occupy the place in the New Council which my son, had he been alive, would have occupied.’</p>
<p>He said he would, if elected, present to Parliament a petition from the Burra, even though it should be opposed to his views.</p>
<p>He would vote for grants in aid of religion, where it is really wanted, would support free trade and would aim to reduce duties and taxes.</p>
<p>He said he was in favour of mineral leases, believing they could do more for the colony than even the Burra Mine had done.</p>
<p>28 May 1851, page 3</p>
<p>SA Election: Mr Stocks at Aberdeen</p>
<p>On Tuesday 20 May Mr Stocks spoke to a largely attended public meeting at the Aberdeen Hotel. Mr Gurner was voted into the chair. He spoke for two hours and made the points reported from his Kooringa meetings. He said his son was one of the snobs who had first got the Burra Mine, and who perhaps interested himself more than anyone else in its discovery. It was proposed and carried unanimously that Mr Stocks is a fit and proper person to represent the District of Burra in the new Council.</p>
<p>Mr Stocks at Kooringa</p>
<p>Mr Stocks again addressed electors at the Burra Hotel. He said this was the last occasion he would address them, as he intended to return to Adelaide in the morning and much would then depend on the exertions of his friends. He was repeatedly applauded in his hour-long speech. He retired amongst great cheering and applause.</p>
<p>The Recent Kooringa Floods</p>
<p>It is estimated that more than £2,000 worth of property has been destroyed in the floods, in addition to a large sum of money said to be lost by those living in the banks of the Burra Creek. As a result money is scarce and trade dull. The general calamity to those who lived in the creek, who generally hide their treasures for safety’s sake in little holes made in the walls of the caverns in which they live, is proof of the need for a banking agency in Kooringa. It is to be hoped the day is not far distant when some banking accommodation will be afforded the tradesmen of Kooringa as well as the industrious workmen. It is understood that the Burra Company has decided to erect a large number of additional cottages so that there will be no excuse for living in the banks of the creek. Very many of the huts have fallen in, and we are gratified to learn that as soon as new cottages are completed the Company intends to unfit the banks of the creek for the excavated huts now so numerous in them. The unfortunates washed out of the creek are deeply indebted to the Rev. James Pollitt and Mr &amp; Mrs Powell for the kind attention they have received at their hands.</p>
<p>The Northern Mails. The irregularity of the mail is a cause for great complaint. Last week was particularly bad. On Saturday the mail did not arrive till about 10 o’clock. There was consequently no delivery that night, but the postmaster Mr Powell very kindly sent around the letters to the principal tradesmen of the township.</p>
<p>Police Court, 21 May.</p>
<p>Mary Johns appeared on summons from Ann Jones, the wife of Gran Jones, smelter of Kooringa. She was charged with a violent assault. The two women began quarrelling at Mr Taylor’s shop in Aberdeen. Each lady defended her case in broken English and sometimes in Welsh, which Mr Lang did not understand. The case was adjourned for the production of more and more understandable evidence.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Gladwin alleged that Catherine Hutchins had illegally in her possession a ring the complainant had lost about two months before. When she saw it on Mrs Hutchins’ finger she asked her how she had got it and was told she had bought it for £1. She subsequently said if the complainant could tell the marks, she would give it up and be the loser of £1. Mrs Hutchins denied all the evidence of Elizabeth Gladwin.</p>
<p>William Bailey swore he had seen the ring on Mrs Hutchins’ finger, but P.C. Rogers had only seen her wearing the two plain rings she then had on.</p>
<p>Jane Gladwin, mother of the complainant, gave the same account as her daughter.</p>
<p>Case adjourned for further evidence.</p>
<p>Benjamin Aldene was charged by PC Fitzgerald with having in his possession a box of stolen items. These items included shoes, boots, coats, trousers, waistcoats, muslin dresses and shawls. PC Roberts corroborated PC Fitzgerald’s evidence and said from patterns of various goods he had received from Mr Hutchins, storekeeper, he believed the goods were part of those stolen from Mr Hutchins and so arrested the prisoner.</p>
<p>James Pearce, timber merchant of Kooringa, said the prisoner had asked one of his draymen to take him and the box to Kapunda, Adelaide or the Gulf. From circumstances, which had come to his knowledge he refused the request. He identified the box.</p>
<p>William Hutchins identified some of the items as being stolen from his shop. Some time elapsed while some witnesses went to compare chisel marks on their premises with a chisel found on Aldene.</p>
<p>In the meantime His Worship continued with the case against James Jones brought by James Pearce. Jones had also been apprehended in connexion with the above case. Pearce said James had assaulted him; apparently because Pearce had given the police some clue in the case. James admitted the assault and was fined 10/- plus 21/- costs.</p>
<p>George Collett, assistant to William Hutchins also identified the stolen items and said the marks on the back door of the shop matched the chisel. PC Rogers reported that the chisel also matched the marks on a cottage recently broken into. His Worship remanded the case so that others could come and identify stolen goods, more of which were produced. His Worship said that from information the Clerk of the Court had been, given this lot of items was found in a hole in the hill behind his house. Mr Gollin, storekeeper of Kooringa, said that at about 7 a.m. that morning a young man in his employ had seen a man and a woman burning some clothes on the hill close to where the bag of shoes etc. had been found.</p>
<p>24 May</p>
<p>By noon when the court was due to begin a large number of persons had assembled as news had spread that four more persons had been arrested in connection with the recent spate of robberies.</p>
<p>George Smith, alias Prince Albert, Mark Allen, James Jones and William Johnson were brought up.</p>
<p>The Sergeant-major said he was not prepared with evidence against William Johnson and explained the circumstances. His Worship ordered Johnson’s release. James Hartshorn was also brought up; charge by Sergeant-major McCulloch with being concerned in the recent robbery at Mr Taylor’s store in Aberdeen; the boots and shoes discovered the previous day being part of the stolen property.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald, solicitor obtained bail for Mark Allen to appear on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr James Taylor gave evidence of the items stolen from his store. He said Hartshorn had been about the premises with another man, but he had not seen any of the other prisoners. Swore that the empty box was his. The box was found on the hill where the bag containing the boots and shoes was found. PC Rogers was with him when they were discovered. He had seen Hartshorn conveying away a bag, but could not say what was in it. Am sure he has robbed me of more than £100 in the last 12 months. He told me the other day he would leave me alone and try someone else.</p>
<p>Hartshorn said that Taylor had a down on him; he had offered £50 the other day to get him transported.</p>
<p>Taylor stated he had said he would give £50 for evidence to convict the prisoner or anyone else who committed the robbery at his store.</p>
<p>Samuel Stowne, cook at Mr Barker’s Smelter’s Home said Hartshorne had borrowed a bag from him on Tuesday evening, but it was not the bag that had contained the boots and shoes.</p>
<p>James Pearce, timber-merchant, stated that Mark Allen had assisted Aldene to carry the box, subsequently seized by the police, into Joe Pickering’s house.</p>
<p>Aldene said Allen had helped carry the box because he was not strong enough to carry it himself.</p>
<p>All the prisoners were remanded to Monday for further evidence.</p>
<p>Charles Ware of the Miners’ Arms said he was prepared to become bail for Allen.</p>
<p>PC Rogers swore to the correspondence between the chisel in evidence and marks on various places broken into and on a writing desk of John Higgs, which was produced in court and the marks shown to correspond precisely.</p>

<p>Advertisement. Kooringa Election. [Advertisement inserted by the Committee to elect H. Mildred.]</p>
<p>Mr Kingston advances as a claim for our votes that he is a Burra Director, that his interests are ours, and that in seeking his own good, he will be promoting ours. We deny that the interests of the inhabitants of the townships and of Mr Kingston are identical.</p>
<p>High wages benefit the miners and labourers and through them the storekeepers and tradesmen, but low wages add to the profits of the Burra Mine and thus to shareholders. As a legislator he would have a say in the control of public funds for immigration etc. Excess immigration could depress wages. So much for the claim that Mr Kingston’s Directorship recommends him to our votes.</p>
<p>He denies universal suffrage. A property qualification is unjust except in a country where a man’s wealth is taken as a measure of his worth. The rest of Mr Kingston’s principles have been advanced in a manner leading us to suppose him unconvinced of any convictions, but willing to make any promises or profess any principles, however inconsistent, in order to gain a post of honour for which he is unfitted. Mr Mildred supports universal suffrage, vote by ballot, triennial Parliaments, Government aid to education, the granting of leases to the discoverers of mineral wealth, the reform of import duties, the repeal of the Distillation Act and cheap and efficient government.</p>
<p>He opposes Church grants, hereditary rank and entails.</p>
<p>With only 16 elected members (the others being nominees of the Crown) one unfit man may involve the colony in years of misgovernment.</p>
<p>Let us accept the SA Mining Association’s letter and vote fearlessly and according to the dictates of conscience and reason.</p>

<p>Police Court, Kooringa, 26 May before W. Lang, Resident Magistrate.</p>
<p>George Butler was charged by Samuel Mason, acting landlord of the Burra Hotel, with stealing a turkey.</p>
<p>Charles Walters gave evidence that Butler had asked that a bag containing the turkey might be left at Walters’ house for two days. Walters had believed it to contain beef and potatoes needed on a journey.</p>
<p>George Mason, cook at the Burra Hotel, said he had missed five turkeys from the hotel, belonging to Mr Paxton. He believed the turkey produced was one of them. PC Rogers said he had received information causing him to go to Cubbin’s house, where he discovered the bag and the turkey. He subsequently found that the Burra Hotel was missing some turkeys. Accused said to Rogers that he had knocked the turkey down in the stable where it was continually making a mess. He took it to Cubbin’s because he did not know what to do with it.</p>
<p>He was remanded to Wednesday. [The Cubbin/Walters confusion is as printed.]</p>
<p>Francis McDonough was charged by Mr Taylor of the Aberdeen Hotel with receiving £3-19-0 change from a money order for £4 that had been due to Mr Windover. Mr Windover returned to the bar soon afterwards and the mistake was discovered. [Various witnesses are cited to prove the case.] The prisoner was ordered to return the £3-19-0 to Mr Taylor who was ordered to pay the expenses.</p>
<p>[James] Hartshorn was charged with the robbery at Mr Taylor’s. Benjamin Spargo said he saw two men at the store on the night of the robbery, but the light was too poor for him to identify either. His Worship said that although there was a strong suspicion there was not enough evidence to convict, he discharged the prisoner with a warning that the police would be watching his future conduct.</p>
<p>Benjamin Aldene was charged with robbery. William Essex, drayman, said Aldene had asked him to take the box on his way to Gum Creek. He had agreed, but on receiving further information had removed it from his dray. His Worship said there seemed to be insufficient evidence to inculpate Mark Allen and Smith, alias Prince Albert. Aldene’s solicitor, Mr Fitzgerald said the boots and shoes found in the prisoner’s box were given to him by a shoemaker to sell on commission. The case was adjourned for the production of further evidence.</p>
<p>The case, in which Elizabeth Gladwin alleged that Catherine Hutchins had illegally in her possession a ring the complainant had lost, was resumed. A number of people gave conflicting evidence, some of which was dismissed as hearsay: Maria Nankervis, Mary Ann Harris, Richard Grenfell, James Nankervis, Elizabeth Gladwin and her mother Mrs Thingame, Mrs Deeble and Mr Thingame.</p>
<p>His worship finally ordered that either the defendant restore the ring to Miss Hutchins or else pay 20/- for it plus 29/- court costs.</p>
<p>Mr Hotchin, butcher, obtained a summons against George Madden for using abusive language to Mrs Hotchin.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald obtained a summons under the Masters &amp; Servants Act to recover £10 due to Agnes Dunn for services rendered as a general servant.</p>
<p>Mr Harry Horten gave information of a robbery which had been committed at his lodging last Friday and stated that a box, a case, and a writing desk were discovered yesterday on the hill behind his lodging. The contents were missing.</p>
<p>27 May</p>
<p>George Madden did not appear when called to defend himself against a charge of using abusive language to Mrs Hotchin. He was fined £1 plus 22/- court costs and ordered confined in the common gaol at Adelaide until the costs were paid.</p>
<p>After hearing evidence from both sides in the case of Agnes Dunn v. Dr Bull, the case was adjourned to Thursday.</p>
<p>Benjamin Aldene was called again and his solicitor, Mr Fitzgerald questioned Mr Warne who said he had known the accused for some time and trusted him with the keys to his place where upwards of £100 worth of goods were kept. He had every confidence in his honesty and had given him boots and shoes to sell on commission and lent him money to buy other goods. He identified the boots and shoes produced in evidence. Mr Fitzgerald asked for his client’s freedom and the return of the boots and shoes. His Worship refused saying he would keep them in the custody of the police. Mr Fitzgerald accused Mr Lang of acting contrary to law.</p>
<p>[Mr Lang and Mr Fitzgerald then had a major row with Fitzgerald calling Lang’s actions biased and lacking in judgement as well as unlawful. Lang accused Fitzgerald of being incompetent as a solicitor.]</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald insisted on identifying each item that was found with Aldene.</p>
<p>Robert Melville, shoemaker identified several pairs of boots and shoes he had given to be sold on commission.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald asked that they be handed over to Mr Melville. Lang refused and he committed Aldene to Adelaide for trial. He said he would hear any other evidence that might come to hand before Aldene’s removal to the city.</p>

<p>Gold Fever in New South Wales</p>
<p>We hear from reliable sources by the overland route that gold has been discovered in large quantities in the Bathurst district. A Mr Ellerton brought a lump weighing 9 oz. The news has caused great excitement, with towns and stations being deserted and everything rising in price. The universal feeling is that there will be a second California.</p>
<p>[Mr Hargrave’s discovery is then described.]</p>
<p>Extremely pure gold has been discovered in SA in the past, both by washing and in sundry dry diggings, as for example the Victoria Gold Mine.</p>
<p>‘A gold mania would be to these colonies a source of great misery, by diverting to a precarious pursuit labour that is now so profitably, productively and happily exerted in the cultivation of a generous soil.’</p>
<p>Notice. Kooringa Money Orders. Those holding orders issued by Mr W. Coote, storekeeper of Kooringa, bearing a date up to December 1850 are advised that they are now payable at the office of Mr Thomas Reynolds, wholesale grocer of Rundle Street or at Mr Samuel Hart’s, wholesale draper of Hindley Street and NOT at Messrs Mac George &amp; Co. as hitherto.</p>

<p>News of the NSW Gold Rush</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald of 21 May has arrived courtesy of Captain Bennett of the Thomas &amp; Henry.</p>
<p>The news from the diggings caused 20 ships to sail without waiting to be loaded, to prevent the desertion of their crews.</p>
<p>[The paper reports a gold discovery by a shepherd called McGregor, in the Wellington district, but he kept its location quiet. It goes on to recount Hargraves’ exploration and his report of the widespread presence of gold in the Wellington-Bathurst area and how Hargraves has established a company of nine working miners at Ophir diggings. Other sites where he discovered gold are cited as Summer Hill, Guyong and Lewis Pond Creek and a little at Dubbo. There is news of a universal rush to the fields. Blacksmiths are in great demand for picks and cradle makers are also very busy. One correspondent suggested that perhaps 3% will become permanent miners. Stories of individual discoveries are told. There is speculation about whether, as in California, the rush will lead to lawlessness and a breakdown in order. The Government is sending troops and police and an assay office is to be opened on the field.]</p>
<p>We understand that J.R. Hardy is appointed Commissioner of the gold districts and he will have the issuing of licences to the diggers, for which it is said a fee of £1 per month is to be charged.</p>
<p>[A letter from G. Lacy provides greater detail and says there are already hundreds of miners at work, but with a constant stream arriving that will soon be thousands. He does not glamorise the scene. He speaks of working in cold water and sleeping in wet clothes. He believes few will succeed without forming a group or company of six to eight. Prices of provisions are already extravagant. Many have already returned.]</p>
<p>10 June 1851, page 2</p>
<p>NSW Gold Fever. [Editorial]</p>
<p>The NSW gold fever will undoubtedly affect us here. Prices of provisions will rise and workers will be induced to go there in even greater numbers and with greater disturbance to economy to an even greater extent than was occasioned by the California Gold Rush. Many of those have returned broken in spirit and health. Few returned richer. We fear the NSW rush will prove to be a delusion and a snare, but will nevertheless have a hard impact on property and the labouring class in this colony. ‘We assert that as yet no case has occurred where the labour bestowed has been adequately rewarded.’</p>
<p>‘It is to be feared that excessive disappointment will attend the majority of gold-seekers.’</p>
<p>The traveller will find prices for provisions have risen hugely. If disappointed, he will find himself in a colony where wages are half that in SA and employment is always scarcer. With a £1 per month tax for a licence to work, no slight success will be necessary.</p>

<p>Mr Kingston’s address is the production of one who thinks that assertions pass for facts. It is a waste of time to wade through his windy verbiage in detail. It is sufficient to say Mr Kingston would add dignity to his cause if he were to rely more on his own merits and not attempt to build his claim to be elected on the ruins of the reputation of his opponent. Mr Kingston’s own principles are not well know here; 10 or 15 minutes of incoherent and unintelligible talk is not enough to convince any constituency that he is possessed of the ability to lead them. The Committee would be very willing to meet Mr Kingston at a public meeting to deal with any of the assertions in Mr Kingston’s address, if he really thinks then to be true and has the courage to maintain them by argument in public.</p>

<p>On 2 June the supporters of Mr Mildred invited that gentleman to a dinner at the Burra Hotel and upwards of 50 gentlemen sat down to a sumptuous entertainment. Dr Bull took the chair and Mr Mortlock the Vice-Chair.</p>
<p>Mr Mildred thanked his hosts and reiterated his political views. Several songs enlivened the evening.</p>
<p>Another Great Flood at Kooringa</p>
<p>The Mines have again escaped undamaged from a serious flood that has been disastrous for the town. At 6 p.m. on Sunday 8 June the town was visited by a dreadful storm of hail, thunder and rain. A correspondent to a merchant in Adelaide writes that his rooms at 8 p.m. were completely deluged and the main street was again ‘like another Niagara’ and there was another washout in the creek, though at present all was chaos. The writer was at a loss to think how the post would get out as the roads were four feet deep in water with the water rushing through every outlet like a waterfall. As he wrote the water was finding its way into every part of the house.</p>
<p>An account written at 11 p.m. arrived yesterday:</p>
<p>We have had another great flood preceded by a tremendous fall of rain. Commercial Street is like a river. Several more families have been washed out of the creek. The creek rose this evening, after dark, so it is impossible to tell the extent of the damage, but it is expected to be very large.</p>
<p>The paper’s own correspondent wrote:</p>
<p>Midnight, Sunday, The Township of Kooringa has again been visited by a fearful flood. In the afternoon thunder and lightning were terrific and the very heavy rain, which subsequently fell in torrents, caused a formidable flow of water from the surrounding hills. By 7 p.m. all the houses on the lower ground in the town were a foot deep in water. There was great apprehension that lives would be lost in the creek. Thunder, lightning and heavy rain continued till 11 p.m., when the storm subsided. The powerful stream that ran through the town to the Burra Creek continued to flow and many will spend a sleepless night, driven from their homes. The damage has not as yet been ascertained, but is believed to be great.</p>
<p>An account written at 6 a.m. Monday morning said it was still raining and the street full of water, like a river.</p>
<p>SA Elections. Canvassing at Kooringa</p>
<p>[A wordy paragraph describes canvassers for one of the candidates being strenuously verbally attacked by a woman at one of the houses in the Mine and then, when attempting to speak to mine workers, being ordered off the property by Captain Dick.]</p>
<p>11 June 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Police Court, Kooringa, 5 June, Resident Magistrate W. Lang and Henry Mildred JP.</p>
<p>A.H. Stace of the Southampton Arms charged Mary Edwards, wife of John Edwards, with the theft of a £10 order on the Burra Company. He believed the order was taken from his house. Yesterday morning a lot of orders were lying on his bed; they did not exactly amount to £5,000.Mrs Wilks and Mrs Edwards were at the bar yesterday morning and Mrs Stace asked Mrs Wilks into the bedroom. Mrs Edwards followed. Later the £10 order was missed. He enquired and found it had been cashed at the Burra Hotel. He knew the order produced was the one lost.</p>
<p>[A deal of evidence was taken on the exact procedures in the morning. Mr Stace had to conceded that on one previous occasion he had once given a man a 25/- order in change in mistake for a 5/- order. Mrs Stace gave evidence corroborating her husband’s.</p>
<p>Sergeant-Major McCulloch said the prisoner admitted having the order, but said she had received it in change for a 10/- order. [Stace had said he was sure he had received no money from Mrs Edwards and that Mrs Wilks had paid for both the ladies’ drinks.]</p>
<p>Mrs Edwards told him she had given the £10 order to her brother and offered to give Stace a different £10 order. He arrested the brother for receiving. The brother was then intoxicated and McCulloch had no reason to know he had been previously deprived of the money he received in change at the hotel. The brother said he had been among the blacks and they had robbed him.</p>
<p>Samuel Mason, acting landlord at the Burra Hotel and Robert Cooper, barman, gave evidence that the £10 order in question had been cashed, but could not confirm who had handed it in. George Tapp gave evidence that the transaction took place, but he too was vague on identities.</p>
<p>Catherine Wilks gave evidence that she had bought two drinks to take away and paid for them, getting coins in change. She said Mrs Edwards had bought a pint of beer and a glass of brandy and had paid for them with an order and received an order and coins in change.</p>
<p>After further details Richard Morgan was sworn and said Mrs Stace had once accused him of stealing a missing order, which was later found in her bed-clothes. Mr Fitzgerald said this went to show the very loose manner in which Mr &amp; Mrs Stace kept their money orders about the house.</p>
<p>The case was then adjourned and resumed on 7 June.</p>
<p>After a couple more witnesses Mr Fitzgerald summed up, pointing out inconsistencies in the evidence of the various witnesses. He pointed out that neither of the accused could read or write and so would not know what was on an order received in change. He contended there was no case to answer.</p>
<p>After retiring for 20 minutes Mr Lang returned and said the Bench had decided that the charge of stealing the order was not sustained and as a consequence the charge of receiving a stolen order failed.</p>
<p>From the known good characters of the prisoners this case excited much interest at Kooringa; and we understand that Mr Fitzgerald has received instructions to commence an action against Mr Stace forthwith.</p>

<p>‘An Old Experienced Miner’ writes on the subject of Grants or Leases for Mineral Lands.</p>
<p>In my travels I have conversed with sheep and stock farmers, miners, shepherds and labourers of various kinds. They have often revealed that they know of mineral discoveries, but have not revealed them because they had no hope of benefiting from it. The land would have to be surveyed and sold and would inevitably fall into the hands of either speculators or mining companies. They would not reveal sites of minerals until they could be sure of being paid for the discovery or getting a share in the venture. The advantage is always in favour of the rich over the explorer or discoverer. Speculators or developers are willing to give a trifle to the discoverer, but only in the event that they become the purchasers.</p>
<p>If leasing were an option the first step of the miner and speculator would be to ascertain the locality of the deposit and a vast number of sites would be pointed out in order to ascertain which to work on. In order to decide this there would be an incentive to pay the discoverers either in money or in shares.</p>
<p>There are three types of indications for mineral lands:</p>
<p>Places with but slight indications. Under present law miners argue that much trouble and expense would be incurred before a decision to mine would be justified. These indications will be passed by as not worth the expense under present law. A lease would enable these indications to be tested and some would go ahead either at once or at a later date when perhaps other opinions or conditions prevail.</p>
<p>The second type of sites have indications of fair quality exist, but not so rich as to be of much value. Areas of the Murray Scrub where there are known deposits of copper at 5% would be an example. Leases would enable these places to be worked, abandoned and work resumed as circumstances change.</p>
<p>The last type of site has rich ore, but the discoverer is afraid that if he discloses it and applies for a survey and has the place put up for sale, the price will be run up beyond his means to purchase. The discoverer will not reveal such sites until he can see how he will benefit.</p>
<p>The Government would benefit by the opening of promising mines now lying dormant. Their development would in turn lead to the demand for agricultural development around them and demand for labourers etc. Objections from graziers that they would be disadvantaged by leases could be managed by some forms of compensation. [The writer gives an example.]</p>
<p>The Great Flood at the Burra Burra</p>
<p>From a letter to Henry Ayers from the Mine, 9 June:</p>
<p>Yesterday we were again visited with lightning, hail and rain to a fearful extent. Great efforts were needed to keep drains clear to prevent ore from being washed away and to stop the water from entering the mine. In these efforts we were successful. The weather broke at 6 p.m. and the surface of the mine was then flooded. At about 9.30 p.m. people came from the creek and begged for horses and carts and I started with five or six carts to assist removing families and furniture etc. Every place in a shed or other covering is filled with people. One poor man by the name of Box, a lander at Paxton’s Shaft, was killed by the falling in of his hut. He has left three children now motherless and fatherless. The bridge going to the smelting house is washed away and at present there is no crossing the creek for either man or horse.</p>
<p>[Obituary: William Box died 9 June 1851 aged 40. The rest of the family is not readily traced, but probably his wife Caroline died 11 July 1850 aged 30, soon after giving birth to Charles Henry on 14 March 1850. This child seems to have survived and married in 1882, though his age then cited does not quite match. The other two children are not easily traced.]</p>
<p>The Register correspondent also wrote on 9 June:</p>
<p>The flood has subsided and the havoc is revealed. William Box was killed last evening by the falling in of his hut in the Burra Creek. He was a widower and leaves three small children. Fortunately no other lives have been lost, but the destruction of property has been great in the miserable holes in the creek. Nearly all the huts in the creek bank have fallen in and will be uninhabitable, so there is little fear of another calamity under similar circumstances. At about 11 p.m. last night the bridge leading to the smelting works of Messrs J. Schneider &amp; Co. gave way and the immense volume of water dammed behind it suddenly rushed down the creek at a frightful rate, carrying all before it. Men standing around it immediately raised the alarm, which spread with the rapidity of electricity. Some families were in bed at the time and so rapid was the rise of water that they were compelled to turn out in their night clothes and make their way to the top of the bank through water that was in many places three or four feet deep. The night was dark and dreary; the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed in rapid succession. Rain fell in torrents and the cries of the distressed were heart-rending. No assistance from the township could be afforded those on the opposite bank of the creek, which was quite impassable for man or horse. Many were as a consequence forced to spend the night with no other covering than their night clothes. Though only the one death is so far reported, more are expected from the effects of the piercing cold and pitiless rain, which prevailed throughout the night. Many sums of money varying from £50 to £500, concealed in the creek huts, are said to have been lost.</p>
<p>Storekeepers in Kooringa had scarcely got their cellars in order after the last flood and happily for them they were not much exposed to the ravages of this flood, but they will be hard hit be the further reduction in trade this flood will cause in a town already suffering general depression of trade due to the last flood. A large quantity of flour is said to have been destroyed in the creek and it is now selling for 58/- a bag at Kooringa, with but little of it on hand.</p>
<p>The smelting works is at a standstill for want of fuel and workmen’s wages are considerably reduced at the Mine. Many of the bridges lately erected by the Smelting Company to facilitate the conveyance of wood from the Murray Scrub are washed away, together with some drays of wood encamped on the road. It is to be hoped the provision of comfortable and suitable cottages for workmen by the two opulent companies at the Burra will see to it that there will be no repeat of this disaster in the future.</p>
<p>Ball at Aberdeen</p>
<p>Mr McFarlane’s last Quarterly Ball took place in the Large Room at the Aberdeen Hotel on Friday 6 June. The weather was favourable and a large group of people attended. The program was well arranged and Mrs McFarlane’s performance on the violin was the theme of universal admiration. The whole evening went very well and much credit is also due to Mr &amp; Mrs Taylor for the completeness of their preparations. It is believed that Mr &amp; Mrs McFarlane will leave Burra in the coming week.</p>

<p>The NSW Gold Mania [Editorial]</p>
<p>The news from Sydney is calculated to inflame the minds of men and induce them to abandon the tangible advantages of their present situation and dash of in pursuit of a beckoning false light. It is one thing to dash off if you are seeking work or have suffered disappointment; it is something else to throw up settled circumstances with the prospect of an independency which has rarely failed to attend labour when accompanied by discretion.</p>
<p>Immediate measures are needed to stop any further immigration ships. So long as the mania persists we would merely be spending our land fund to benefit the labour market in NSW.</p>
<p>Fortunately SA can boast a race of men bound by no ordinary ties to her soil. She will reap the reward of the system that has allowed the poor man to become a freeholder. They will no lightly throw away the advantages they have reaped by the sweat of their brow. On this security we rest. There will remain enough sturdy arms and toil-hardened hands in SA among her freeholders to reap her harvests and shear her sheep, though hosts of the labouring population should, to their own bane, leave us.</p>
<p>The NSW Gold Diggings</p>
<p>[The reports from the Bathurst district confirm large auriferous deposits and there are statements that 400 men working around the Government Geologist were making 1 to 2 oz of gold a day. The £1 gold licence is confirmed, as is the rising price of provisions, with flour reaching £30 per ton.</p>
<p>A letter to the Register removes any doubt of the fact that a vast quantity of gold is to be found between Summerhill in the south and Dubbo in the north, known generally as the Wellington District, 35 miles from Bathurst and 150 miles from Sydney. Gold is selling at £3-3-0 to £3-5-0 per troy ounce. Six men in a few days raised 17 ounces and another report said men were getting an ounce per day.</p>
<p>While men can easily make 15/- a day, the cost of provisions is very high and as a result many robberies are taking place. Excitement is still rising and men are arriving in large numbers. Other industrial pursuits in the colony are being neglected and as a result wages have suddenly risen almost 25%. A complete madness has overtaken the colony. [Details are given of law and order issues and the costs and means of getting from Sydney to the area, as well as reports on how other parts of the economy are being affected.]</p>
<p>Adelaide Share Market</p>
<p>As a reaction to the NSW gold discoveries the value of Burra Burra shares has fallen by £10.</p>

<p>A Third Flood at Kooringa</p>
<p>From the Register correspondent, 10 June at 11 p.m.:</p>
<p>At about 6 p.m. this evening when everything was miserably tranquil in the town, a considerable body of water suddenly rushed down the main street and in a few minutes all the houses along Commercial Street had, for the third time this season, an abundance of water at their doors and in some instances at their fireside. This abrupt appearance of water was a surprise when there had been no material fall of rain for a day. The sky then became cloudy and seemed to threaten rain, but fortunately that has not eventuated and at present the sky is again clearing.</p>
<p>Those unfortunates washed out of their creek accommodation are entirely dependent on their friends. Many are said to have suffered severe financial loss and it is reported that several hundred pound has been washed away or buried in the collapsed huts. This is another reminder of the want of banking facilities in Kooringa.</p>
<p>The Smelting Works have not escaped unscarred. They are situated in an amphitheatre on the eastern side of the Burra Creek and suffered from the inrush of waters from the hills flowing to the main creek. The ash pits were, of course, filled with water, but as the works were at a standstill from want of fuel, the damage was not so great as it would have been were they in operation. It is reported that 13 drays belonging to the Smelting Company have been washed away from the encamping ground at Balwin [sic: for Baldina], where the blacksmith’s forge, situated on the high bank of the creek, was knee deep in water. Damages sustained by the company are estimated at £1,000.</p>
<p>The Burra Mine has not suffered in such a serious way. Some of the shafts and pits have acquired extra water, which will cause some delays in operations. Given the distress of those who have been forced from their creek huts, it is hoped that the Burra Mine Directors will take swift action to erect cottages to rehouse them.</p>
<p>Kooringa News: The Flood of 8 June</p>
<p>Yesterday, Whitsunday, will be long remembered. From about 3 p.m. it grew very dark in the southeast and continued to grow blacker with occasional thunder until 6.15 p.m. when a peal of thunder broke over the Mine and rain and hail began to fall in torrents. This continued till 10 p.m. when it eased a little and the heavy weather passed to the southwest, though rain continued. At about 3 a.m. numerous huts in the creek were washed out and their occupants forced to flee. At about 11 the Smelting Company’s bridge was washed away and after it in succession every bridge across the creek. A survey of the wreck is awful and where the dispossessed will live is a puzzler. A great many money orders have been lost and worst of all William Box aged 45, a widower with three children, the eldest 5 and the youngest a babe in arms, is also lost. His housekeeper tells me that he went to bed about 11, but the baby was restless, and feeling uneasy about the flood water, she awoke him and he got up. He put her and the children in a house on the bank, and with a neighbour began to remove the furniture, which was very good. About 2 a.m. the water was about two feet deep in the hut and while he was removing an article the roof fell in, knocking his comrade on his face. He managed to crawl free, but Box was knocked backwards and a large mass fell on him, trapping him. It took until daylight to extricate the body. He lies in a stable at the new public house awaiting the inquest. It appears he also had £400, afterwards found in his box*. Very few huts remain and those chiefly near the cemetery on the north side. The township also felt the effects with stores being swamped and the street a complete river. Last night it was three feet deep opposite the post office and it is now ankle deep there. A quantity of flour was lost in the creek and flour is selling at 58/- per bag. The Patent Copper Company has been stopped for want of fuel and wages at the Mine were reduced.</p>
<p>[*This statement regarding the £400 was later said to be incorrect by Sergeant-Major McCulloch in court on 18 June as reported in the Register of 25 June.]</p>

<p>The Moral Responsibility of Employers. [Editorial]</p>
<p>[After a discussion of the relationships and tensions between employer and worker in the UK, the convict colonies and SA, the editor moves on to the moral obligations of the employer to provide for employees. This leads to another plea for the Directors of the SA Mining Association for the ‘erection of suitable habitations for those men be whose exertions huge profits have been realized’.</p>

<p>Savings of the Burra Miners</p>
<p>It is said the police have in their possession more than £400 belonging to the late William Box, who was drowned in the Burra Creek during the flood. This is a singular illustration of the pertinacity with which the miners preferred their cells to other habitations; Box we understand owned several cottages in the township, while he himself resided in the Creek. [Both the statement regarding the £400 and that concerning the ownership of cottages were later said to be incorrect by Sergeant-Major McCulloch in court on 18 June as reported in the Register of 25 June.]</p>

<p>Police Court, Kooringa, W. Lang Resident Magistrate, 11 June.</p>
<p>George Tisoc charged J.S. Barnett for the balance of wages due when he was dismissed without notice. There was at issue the question of whether Tisoc’s second month of employment was the result of a second contract or a continuation of the first, which had allowed dismissal without notice. Mr Lang ruled that Tisoc was entitled to be paid for the time served and 30/- towards his expenses in returning to Adelaide.</p>
<p>Betsy James proved a case of affiliation against Thomas Moyle, sawyer of Kooringa. The Bench ordered that Moyle pay £5-5-0 for the complainant’s expenses during her confinement, 26/- court costs and 2/6 a week for the support of the child.</p>
<p>William Blair, baker, summonsed James Taylor of the Aberdeen Hotel for two month’s wages. Mr Fitzgerald, for Blair, said his client had an agreement to serve Taylor for 12 months at 30/- per week for the first four months and 40/- per week, with flour and bread for his use, for the last 8 months. He was suing for 8 weeks, being the time actually served. Taylor claimed Blair had misappropriated flour and the case was adjourned for further evidence.</p>
<p>Turton Diprose, stockholder, obtained a summons against Joseph Jones for the illegal possession of a sow valued at £3, property of Diprose.</p>
<p>Turton Diprose, stockholder, obtained a summons against John Hawking to recover £1 for damage done by Hawking’s dog to a heifer belonging to Diprose. [When settled on 18 June the name is cited as Hawkins.]</p>
<p>12 June</p>
<p>The case of Blair v. Taylor was referred to arbitration.</p>
<p>13 June</p>
<p>Pollard and Thomas, draymen sought advice. They had been engaged by Mr Young of Watervale to deliver five dray-loads (c. 8 tons) to Mr Richardson in Kooringa. Mr Young was to meet them on arrival, but he failed to do so and Richardson refused to take delivery because the hay was wet. His Worship advised them to contact Young immediately and to keep the hay in safe custody. They asked if they would have a claim on Young for the time their drays were delayed. He said yes.</p>
<p>14 June</p>
<p>Captain Bath pf the Princess Royal Mine appeared to answer the summons of Thomas Rosewall for £7-19-6 being the balance of wages due in respect of ore raised and dressed February to May 1850. The argument depended on a deal of technical mining practice and eventually the Bench ruled that the defendant would pay the plaintiff £5-17-0 and each party would pay its own expenses. The company was given till next Monday to pay.</p>

<p>NSW Gold</p>
<p>A private letter says a lump of gold weighing 46 ounces is going home to the Great Exhibition on the Thomas Arbuthnot, but the Captain has been unable to complete his crew, despite the offer of very tempting wages. One merchant has shown in his office six pieces weighing collectively 9 lb. It is announced there has been a big discovery at Maitland.</p>
<p>In SA there are rumoured discoveries at Mount Torrens and reports from Mount Remarkable, but these are unauthenticated.</p>
<p>23 June 1851, page 2</p>
<p>NSW Gold Diggings</p>
<p>The news seems to indicate that the discoveries are in a very limited area. Great numbers of people have left their usual employment to go to the fields. The defection of Newcastle coal miners has seen the price of coal in Sydney rise to extraordinary levels. Gold mining, like any other mining, needs to be organised and conducted systematically. To rush in helter skelter with every man for himself is to court disaster. Such has been the case in California; where 99% would have been better off had they never gone.</p>
<p>[The writer goes on to explain why for men in SA in work or who can generally obtain it their best chance of getting gold is by remaining where they are. He also points out the high cost of living on the goldfields and suggests that even if men went to Sydney they are as likely to do well taking the jobs of those who have left for the goldfields as by going there themselves.]</p>

<p>SA Elections: Mr Kingston at Kooringa</p>
<p>Mr Kingston and his Adelaide friends have been busy canvassing the Burra in the last week. It was widely rumoured that Mr Kingston would address a public meeting in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Saturday evening. A large number of people turned up, the room was lit and every appearance of an impending meeting was there, but nothing could be seen of the aspiring candidate. A messenger was then sent to request Mr Kingston’s attendance, but he met with a polite refusal.</p>
<p>Burra Miners are showing little inclination to rush to the NSW goldfields. The lessons of California seem to have been learnt. Should the early reports be confirmed, however, it is likely that many will be induced to leave. At the Mine flour has risen to £3-10-0 a bag and a 4 lb loaf costs 1⁄2. Mutton and beef are 3d to 4d per pound.</p>
<p>As soon as fine weather sets in the Mine is expected to be able to employ all the hands at the Burra and probably many more.</p>
<p>The Joseph Weir has just arrived with the large engine for the Burra Mine. This enormous engine for the SA Mining Association is virtually the sole cargo for the vessel, except for 100 tons of coal for the Patent Copper Company.</p>
<p>25 June 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. On Wednesday 18 June W. Lang, coroner, conducted an inquest on the body of James Thompson at the Smelters’ Home Hotel. A girl aged about 10 said the deceased, who had been drinking at the Redruth Arms, in attempting, while intoxicated, to cross the Burra Creek on his way home, lost his footing and was thrown down by the stream. The body was recovered today and taken to the Aberdeen Hotel, where the jurymen came to view it. In declaring a verdict of accidental death, Mr Gollin, as foreman recommended that the Burra Mining Company be asked to place footbridges across the Burra Creek at appropriate intervals and either repair or remove the damaged bridge to the Smelting Works so it does not impede the flow. He also said that the law should be change to make 12 rather than 24 menthe number for a jury, as it was inconvenient for him and others to be called so often from their businesses. 12 were sufficient in Adelaide. Mr Lang thought such a change would have to wait till the new Legislative Council met. There was also a complaint that the officers of the Mining and Smelting Companies were not inconvenienced by having to sit on juries.</p>
<p>[James Thompson died 17 June 1851 aged 52.]</p>
<p>Police Court, Kooringa, W. Lang, Resident Magistrate, 16 June.</p>
<p>A summons was obtained against John Webster for depositing filth in the public street.</p>
<p>Agnes Dunn, for the fourth time, applied for a decision in her case against Dr Bull. The agreement between them was for six months as a general servant at £20 p.a. plus board and rations. If she stayed three months half her fare was to be deducted from her wages and if for six months Dr Bull was to pay all the fare. He dismissed her after six weeks when she refused to change her sleeping arrangements from the kitchen to the sitting-room adjoining Dr Bull’s bedroom, and through which he would have to pass if called out during the night. The plaintiff said Dr Bull has offered to pay her 11/- and later 13/- for her six weeks’ service. She had served Mr Dashwood for three months and the Advocate General for nine months and had always maintained a good character.</p>
<p>Dr Bull complained of her misbehaviour, impertinent answers to Mrs Bull, laziness and late rising.</p>
<p>Mrs Bull said the plaintiff had been on occasions most insolent and had refused to obey her orders.</p>
<p>After further evidence of the plaintiff’s alleged behaviour Mr Fitzgerald asked for a decision.</p>
<p>Mr Lang said he was prepared to give it, but recommended an adjournment to give the parties time to come to some arrangement, and although they agreed to the adjournment no acceptable decision could be reached.</p>
<p>Mr Lang then ordered that Agnes Dunn accept £2, which Dr Bull had offered to pay, or go without anything.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald was indignant at His Worship’s ruling, which would leave his client with virtually nothing after paying 14/- court costs and other necessary expenses, but under the circumstance he had to advise her to accept the arrangement.</p>
<p>18 June</p>
<p>James Middleton was charged with letting his pigs run at large in the streets of Redruth. He said he owned no pigs. PC Rogers said he had seen the pigs at large and watched them enter Mr Middleton’s sty in Aberdeen. Mr Middleton’s servant girl had said they belonged to Mr Middleton. Mr Middleton said he kept no servant girl. The case was dismissed and a fresh summons was issued in the name of Mr Middleton’s son, who lived at Aberdeen with his father.</p>
<p>William Hawkins appeared to answer the summons of Turton Diprose for an injury caused by his ferocious dog. It was settled out of court.</p>
<p>Mr Madden appeared in answer to a summons by Mr Bruce [sic: perhaps M.J.H. Bruse?], cabinetmaker, who was demanding the price of a coffin ordered by the defendant for a poor women who died in Kooringa some time since.</p>
<p>Mr Madden had already lost £6 on this sad case because the husband of the deceased had absconded soon after his wife’s death. Mr Bruce now wanted £4 for the coffin.</p>
<p>His Worship, who had previously suggested that a subscription should be got up to cover the funeral expenses, said it was hard that Mr Madden should now be charged with an additional cost. He undertook to bring the case before the Government and would try to get some assistance in the matter. He also suggested they approach Mr Kingston. He had no doubt, that properly handled, such an approach would meet with a favourable reception. Mr Kingston had already earned praise for his charitable assistance to the widow of a man lately killed at the mine. He had sent her a cheque for £5 and he was creditably informed the same gentleman had sent a cheque for £10 to the benefit of the three orphan children of William Box, who had died in the recent flood. Sergeant-Major McCulloch confirmed that this was so; Captain Roach had come to him before handing over the cheque to confirm the story that the police were holding £400 of Box’s money. This statement and that saying that Box had owned cottages in the town had appeared in the Register, but were incorrect.</p>
<p>[See the Register of 23 December 1850, page 3 where the death of Bridget Patterson on 17 December 1850 is reported.]</p>
<p>Alexander Middleton was charged with keeping four pigs at large in Redruth. Middleton said he owned no pigs and Martha Buchanan, who had previously identified Mr Middleton as the owner, now said she was mistaken in that. There being no other evidence, the charge was dismissed.</p>
<p>26 June 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Police Court, Kooringa, W. Lang, Resident Magistrate, Monday 23 June.</p>
<p>Thomas Porter, who had only been released from custody on Saturday when Mr Mortlock paid a fine of £2-3-0 for a previous assault, was charged with assaulting John Williams. John Williams said that at the Burra Hotel on Saturday evening at about 9 p.m. the prisoner grabbed him by the hair and struck him severely on the eye. He believed the assault was committed because a short time previously he had interfered to stop the prisoner assaulting Dr Bull. Porter was fined 10/- plus 21/- costs or one month’s imprisonment.</p>
<p>He was then also charged with assaulting PC James Taylor and for this was fined 40/- plus 21/- court costs, or one month’s imprisonment.</p>
<p>He was also charged with assaulting PC Rogers in the execution of his duties. PC Rogers said the prisoner had thrown a glass at him at the Burra Hotel on Saturday night and only his police helmet had protected him from injury. On his way to the station Porter had said he would waylay Rogers and serve him as he had served Sergeant Rose; he would fetch him down ere he was aware, and if he had a sharp axe would cleave his way through the lot of them. For this offence he was fined £5 with 21/- costs. He was further bound over to keep the peace towards PC Rogers and all others for the term of six months and to be imprisoned until such security was given. Porter advised His Worship to make out the warrant as soon as possible, for he did not intend to pay the fines.</p>
<p>Mr Mason of the Burra Hotel was sent for by Mr Lang and when he arrived was reprimanded for serving Porter drink. He did not mean to say that Mason had done so with any bad intention, indeed on this occasion he believed he had done so in order to quieten him. He did, however, believe that Mason and other publicans were acting contrary to the law by encouraging sech a fellow to frequent their houses.</p>
<p>Mr Mason disclaimed any intent to encourage Porter’s riotous conduct and he contradicted a report that he had previously given Porter money and drink to encourage him to create a disturbance on certain occasions.</p>
<p>Dr Lloyd, Dr Hill, Mr Mason and Mr Gollin begged to state in court that as members of Mr Kingston’s Committee they deprecated the idea that porter had been aided and abetted by their Committee, or sanctioned directly or indirectly. They would instantly withdraw from the Committee if the slightest semblance of such conduct was evinced.</p>
<p>His Worship asked if they had intended to imply that he had said anything to implicate them or any of their Committee in Tom Porter’s outrages. They said at once that they had no reason to believe any such thing. They merely wished to dispel a disgraceful rumour which prevailed.</p>
<p>Richard Webb was charged with assaulting PC Taylor at the Burra Hotel on Saturday night. After considerable evidence, Webb was fined 5/- plus 23/- costs.</p>

<p>Suspension of Mr Lang</p>
<p>We understand the reports of the behaviour of Mr Lang at the Burra on a recent occasion are substantially true. Apparently he has taken it into his head that ‘once a king always a king’. When he found a notice affixed to the Court-House door at Kooringa bearing Mr Dashwood’s signature as returning officer, he tore it down and even threatened to give Mr Dashwood in charge if he presented himself to exercise the duties of the office forfeited by Mr Lang when he put himself forward as a candidate for legislative honours. We are also informed that the Governor and Executive Council have forwarded to the Burra several documents and the opinions of Law Officers of the Crown, respecting various irregularities committed by Mr Lang in his position as Resident Magistrate, in some of which he has, it appears, laid himself open to indictment, and the Governor and Council have required him to go to Adelaide to make such explanation as he can, and failing to do so have indicated that he will be suspended from office during Her Majesty’s pleasure.</p>
<p>Mr Dashwood will act as Returning Officer and will act for Mr Lang pending the investigation that has been ordered.</p>

<p>The SA Mining Association has made arrangements to sell all of their ore from the Burra Burra Mine to the Patent Copper Company as soon as their present contract with the Apoinga Smelting Works is completed. The arrangement is for a period identical with that already existing between the two companies, which has five years to run. The effect will make the Apoinga Smelting works entirely dependent on ore from the other northern mines. It will increase the internal resources of the colony by bringing a larger amount of copper ore into the hands of the Patent Copper Company for smelting in lieu of making shipments of ore as hitherto. We believe it is also contemplated making arrangement for the shipment of lower grade ores to NSW for smelting there, receiving back coal. The Patent Copper Company only wants a satisfactory position regarding the supply of fuel to ensure a long term of prosperous operations.</p>

<p>Editorial: Gold Diggings in NSW and Gold discovered in Victoria</p>
<p>[The article is mostly a selection of correspondence from various letters and reporters.]</p>
<p>Though some have had success at Bathurst, when it is stated that there are some 2,000 at the diggings, the number of successes have not been very numerous.</p>
<p>Many diggers have already moved on to other employment.</p>
<p>The weather is now very severe.</p>
<p>Mr Hargraves has been awarded £500 for his discovery of gold and has been appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands.</p>
<p>A letter from Bathurst:</p>
<p>There are more than 2,000 diggers.</p>
<p>Those in parties of c. 6 are doing best.</p>
<p>Saw a company find a piece 16 oz and saw many other pieces 1 to 8 oz.</p>
<p>On the other hand a company of 6 that had worked hard got only 17/6 worth of gold.</p>
<p>There is general dissatisfaction at having to get a 30/- licence.</p>
<p>From the Bathurst Free Press</p>
<p>One party of 4 (4 of them teetotallers) got £165 for 10 days’ work, in pieces from 3 oz down.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick’s party won £184-10-0 for two weeks labour, or £40 per man.</p>
<p>McGregor’s party of 5 in 5 days did not clear expenses, but in the next 5 days earned £95. Overall they earned about £1-6-0 per man per day.</p>
<p>[The article goes on with examples of good and bad luck.]</p>
<p>Rewards have been offered for the discovery of gold in the Maitland area.</p>
<p>There are reports of gold discoveries in the Burragorang Ranges.</p>
<p>While some diggers have picked up large pieces, not one person in 50 has fallen across anything larger than 1 oz.</p>
<p>The diggers are mostly housed very poorly in gunyahs, which offer little protection from the biting cold and none from the rain.</p>
<p>There are recent reports of 85 teams and over 200 men camped at Mary’s Lane en route for Ophir.</p>
<p>Mr Joseph West reports seeing 168 drays and 1117 men between Sydney and the foot of Mount Victoria.</p>
<p>Employers in Bathurst say they can get plenty of labour from unsuccessful miners.</p>
<p>Two shipments of gold of £3,000 and £4,000 respectively have been sent to London and are sure to convince people there that the gold discoveries in Australia are substantial.</p>
<p>A private letter from Bathurst tells of its writer having seen a 7 lb troy lump of gold.</p>
<p>Victoria</p>
<p>A meeting in Melbourne on 9 June set up a subscription list to establish a reward for the discoverer of gold in the Port Phillip Bay District – within 200 miles of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Also to discuss the possibility of Government rewards, perhaps in the form of land grants.</p>
<p>On 17 June the Melbourne Times announced that Mr Welsh, a watchmaker, had discovered gold in the Plenty District on 12 June, in quartz veins varying from 1 inch to 18 inches in width. It was in the form of gold dust, to be recovered from the slate by grinding it to powder and then washing it. Tests verified it was gold when Mr Welsh and Henry Frenchman submitted it to analysis.</p>
<p>The Governor has been petitioned to offer a reward for the discovery of gold.</p>
<p>On 16 June Mr Thomas Clarke, a solicitor, received from a friend a fine specimen of gold found in the Pyrenees. Also Mr Reay Clarke of Kilmore discovered gold in the King Parrot Creek.</p>

<p>Latest from the Bathurst Goldfield</p>
<p>The Surveyor-General Sir Thomas Mitchell is visiting the diggings. A post office is proposed with three deliveries a week. The aggregate yield remains large, but individual takings are very irregular. By the Wednesday before the 7 June 1,000 licence fees had been paid.</p>
<p>At a recent date there were about 2,000 persons at Ophir, with the crowd increasing daily. Generally, co-operative parties of six or seven, properly equipped, and victualled for two or three months are doing best. It seems that gold worth £20,000 has been declared won so far, but how much is being kept secret is unknown. A party of three or four gentlemen from Sydney purchased £900 worth from a few diggers. Of their purchase, one specimen exhibited in a Sydney jeweller’s window weighed 461⁄2 ounces. Although the gold district extends for over 300 square miles, the immediate locality where it is being extracted in remunerative quantities is very limited in extent.</p>

<p>SA Elections: The Kooringa Poll</p>
<p>Up the present the despatches sent to us by express messenger have not arrived. The chosen messenger got drunk and reached only as far as Gawler, being picked up there on Saturday morning in a state of intoxication. He came on by mail, but up to this moment we have not been able to find Patrick Spencer.</p>
<p>Polling passed quietly and resulted in:</p>
<p>Kingston Mildred</p>
<p>Kooringa 225 93</p>
<p>Adelaide 15 1</p>
<p>Total 240 94</p>
<p>This gives Mr Kingston a majority of 146.</p>
<p>The successful candidate was drawn through the streets of the township in his carriage and the humours of the procession were varied by the effigy of a certain Doctor, who has made himself notorious for his zeal on behalf of the opposition.</p>
<p>The Election at Kooringa</p>
<p>Mr Kingston’s Speech at the election is printed.</p>
<p>I have always been the staunch advocate of civil and religious freedom. I have sought the abolition of all restrictions on my Catholic countrymen and of tithes, the repeal of the Test and Corporation laws, the reform of the House of Commons and the abolition of imprisonment for debt except for fraud. I will fight any law that seeks to give any man greater civil rights or social rank than another. While not denying the importance of the agricultural and squatting interests, I assert that the mining interest is the leading one in this colony. As the miners prosper so will the market for the produce of the farmers and squatters will grow. I would support a change to the system of opening up mining lands. Some have proposed leases rather than selling mineral lands, but this does not go far enough. I propose that any discover of mineral land should be entitled to claim an 80-acre section and on the payment of £1 per acre the land should be his without compensation, but that the grant not be made for one, two or three years, but as soon as he can prove the expenditure of £500 in exploring and developing the land for mineral purposes, the grant should be issued without further conditions.</p>
<p>[He then discusses his role in the passing of the Bill to establish SA and his passage to SA in charge of the first party of emigrants in 1836, arriving at Holdfast Bay in November 1836.]</p>
<p>I will not say no one has done more for SA, but I will say no one has served it more sincerely and devotedly.</p>
<p>‘It is now within a few days of six years since I first stood on this spot, entrusted by the Directors with the responsible duty of fixing the boundaries of the Special Survey.’</p>
<p>No director has devoted more time and attention, or worked more zealously to promote the prosperity of the men than the humble individual now soliciting your suffrages.</p>
<p>[He then goes on at some length to attack Mr Lang, who had come out as his opponent until discovering that he could not be simultaneously a legislator and a magistrate. He also attacks Lang as a magistrate, calling attention to his inconsistencies in sentencing; ‘today, a burglar’s violence in the dead of night is punished by a fine of a few shillings; to-morrow, a misdemeanour is visited with imprisonment and hard labour.’]</p>
<p>Then came Mr Mildred, who has tried his fortune in almost every constituency; Port, East Torrens, Gawler &amp; Stanley, Barossa and Port Lincoln. Rejected in his own neighbourhood, he came to seek the votes of electors in Kooringa. His own district of East Torrens has this last week been in need of a candidate, but no one there has proposed Mr H. Mildred.</p>
<p>[Kingston then goes on at length to describe how Mr Mildred infiltrated by means of an alias, the group of gentlemen who formed an association meeting at the Adelphi in London in 1834, to promote the establishment of SA. He says Mildred did nothing to help the cause, but positioned himself to benefit when the obstacles to establishing the colony had been overcome. He says he was a speculator.]</p>
<p>The requisition calling on me to stand bears the signatures of the Directors Messrs Paxton, Sanders, &amp; Beck and of Mr Ayers. These men would hardly do this, or elect me to a seat on their own Councils if I was the weak and talentless individual the opposition would have you believe.</p>
<p>15 July 1851, page 3</p>
<p>‘Kooringa’ writes re the Kooringa election:</p>
<p>The overpowering influence of the mining proprietary, backed by Paxton, has returned Kingston as a representative. The votes are two to one in favour of the Director.</p>
<p>‘Every description of influence and means have been used by the successful candidate to achieve his return; money has been lavished in profusion; power ahs been exercised where it was possible to bring it to bear; timidation has been held as a rod over the weak, and promises extraordinry. Lawn sleves mermydons in office, discarded servants, and oppressed workers, to ensure the return of the director.’</p>
<p>[But the writer asserts that the spirit of opposition has been established and will in time triumph.]</p>
<p>‘Early on the morn of this day, one of cheering brightness, the banners of Green and Blue were seen waving to the winds, which never before visited the spot.’</p>
<p>‘Children shouting, Bands playing, people gazing, all seemed to fancy a scene of amusement was at hand, and their expectations were met, for as early as nine Ocloc in the morning some fifty Ancient britons from the smelting works, two by two, proceeded from the paddock (the place of rendevous) to the place of polling, to record their votes for the Candedate the thought the most worthy of there support.’</p>
<p>One banner read ‘We fear not, We care not.’ Mildred and freedom is our wish and we defy the oppression of our employers.</p>
<p>But the 100 votes or so could not contend with those of the miners, who had received their orders and were obliged for the moment to bend to influences.</p>
<p>[The wording of the next section is somewhat unintelligible, but it says clearly enough that £100 was distributed at the Burra Hotel to buy votes for Kingston.]</p>
<p>‘If Justice holds sway, Mr Kingston will never take a seat in the House of Assembly.’</p>
<p>‘Mildred forever and down with the Greens.’</p>

<p>Kooringa Dinner for G.S. Kingston</p>
<p>Friends of Mr Kingston gave him a dinner at the Burra Hotel last Thursday to celebrate his election to the Legislative Council. Mr Mason of the hotel was instructed to spare no cost and accordingly prepared a feast including every available luxury.</p>
<p>A group of 50-60 gentlemen assembled at 6 p.m., including three Directors of the SA Mining Association as well as its Secretary and Dr Chambers, who occupied the chair. The main guests were G.S. Kingston Esq. MLC, Montague Featherstonhaugh Esq., Captain Henry Roach, J. Waterhouse Esq., Henry Ayers Esq. and T.W. Powell Esq. Mr Gollin was Vice-Chair at one table and Mr McWilliam at the other. After the meal speeches and toasts were interspersed with musical items.</p>
<p>The Chairman began with toasts to the Queen, Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family and then the SA Governor. James Chambers followed with a song.</p>
<p>The Chairman then proposed G.S. Kingston. He described Mr Kingston’s win as the triumph of principles over prejudice and animosity. The campaign had been one of the grossest abuse and scurrility. It had been a campaign fought on personality and personal vindictiveness.</p>
<p>Mr Kingston responded. Having thanked them all profusely he said that by the next time they met he hoped the Lieutenancy would be removed from their Governor’s title. SA had no need for the supervision of Sydney, its ruler or its Council. Mr Godfrey then followed with a song.</p>
<p>Mr McWilliams proposed the Chairmen of SAMA, to which Mr Featherstonhaugh responded, during which he said:</p>
<p>‘I believe the Directors of the South Australian Mining Association have always conducted the affairs of the Company in a spirit of openness and liberality; and in every undertaking have always consulted the interests of the officers and men in their employ.’</p>
<p>Having recently returned from travels in other Australian colonies he could say that he had seen nothing to compare with the South Australian spirit or the monster mine.</p>
<p>Mr Ayers then sang Have You Heard of the Monster Mine?</p>
<p>Mr T.W. Powell then proposed Mr Henry Ayers, describing him as the keystone in an arch of which the inhabitants of Burra were one buttress and the SAMA Directors were the other.</p>
<p>Captain Matthew Bryant then sang the Ivy Green.</p>
<p>Mr Henry Ayers returned thanks for the previous toast. Their presence at Kooringa tonight gave proof of the success of the mining interest and of the trading community of the Burra.</p>
<p>‘The late floods have operated in some measure to retard operations, but the mine looks as promising as ever, and very shortly a large number of men will be employed with every prospect of a busy and prosperous summer.’</p>
<p>A song by Mr Barnett was followed by Mr Gollin’s toast to agricultural interests.</p>
<p>Mr Pearce sang The Vital Spark, after which Mr Kingston proposed the Town and Trade of Kooringa and Mr Godfrey proposed the health of the Captains and operative Miners of SA and especially Captain Roach:</p>
<p>‘The Burra Mine would not have been what it is had it not been for the well-known practical skill and knowledge of its Superintendent.</p>
<p>Mr R. Hotchin sang The Rose of Allandale.</p>
<p>Captain Roach responded and complimented the miners and officers of the mine, concluding with a toast to the health of Captain Bryant, who then responded. Mr Alfred Barker then sang The Minute-gun at Sea.</p>
<p>Edward Fitzgerald proposed the success of the Burra Copper Works and spoke at some length on why smelting in SA was preferable to shipping the raw ore to England – but he spoke so softly that the reporter heard little of it.</p>
<p>Mr Coote proposed the Press of SA and Dr Smith sang a German song.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner proposed Lady Young and the Ladies of SA, which was followed by the song Our Own British Oak.</p>
<p>James Chambers proposed the health of Dr Chambers and also sang a song.</p>
<p>Dr Chambers responded and ended by proposing the health of the 245 electors who voted for Mr Kingston, after which the principal guests left the room amid loud cheering.</p>
<p>Mr Powell was then voted into the vacated chair and proposed the health of W.R. Mortlock. The reporter left at midnight and so has to rely on hearsay that some of the guests had not reached home by breakfast time.</p>
<p>Peter Dawson of Sydney writes a letter dated Sydney 20 June 1851.</p>
<p>When I wrote last month I was labouring under the gold fever like many others in Sydney, but my friends have returned to Sydney greatly disappointed. Then Sydney was all a bustle, but now it is very dull. The prices of goods and labour are falling and there is no great demand for either. If you or your friends are thinking of coming, be warned that many have returned from the diggings disappointed. I spoke to one whom I know to be a good working man. He had just sold his gold for £10, but it had cost him £20 sterling in silver to get it. There are thousands at the diggings and prices for flour etc. are falling and flour has of late been cheaper at Bathurst than in Sydney.</p>
<p>‘PS – I see this morning that four vessels from Port Phillip have brought 200 passengers who intend to go to the goldfields. They must be surprised to see scores of men walking about Sydney starving. They are now returning from the mines in hundreds. They say hundreds there are not earning 1/- per day. Where one man is fortunate, five hundred are unfortunate. A great many have also burnt their fingers in speculation.</p>
<p>‘I say the gold mines are a complete failure. And once more may I say, ‘Warn every man you know not to be gulled by false reports.’ June 23, 1851.</p>

<p>Advertisement. Morewood, Rogers &amp; Co. have a lengthy advertisement extolling the virtues of galvanized iron. It is ideal for verandahs and general roofing. It is cheap to erect, requiring no framework for verandahs except a wall plate and columns. It is cheaper, lighter and cooler than slate. It keeps water pure at all times and is light and durable and so is recommended for baths, buckets, deed boxes, gutters, pipes, windguards and cistern-heads.</p>

<p>Gold has certainly been discovered in SA, but so far not in such quantities to be profitable or to convince shareholders to invest. Specimens are to be seen in the shop-window of our fellow-citizen, Mr Pollack and indicate that some come from dry diggings as well as from the alluvial deposits along the Torrens.</p>

<p>From the Bathurst Free Press of 18 July:</p>
<p>Bathurst has again gone mad with gold fever. On Sunday it was whispered about that Dr Kerr had found a hundredweight of gold. The writer took this as a wild story, but the next day a tandem driven by Mr W.H. Suttor, Dr Kerr’s brother-in-law, drew up with two massive pieces of the precious metal. Soon 150 people were present and the pieces were handed around. A square tin box in the vehicle held the rest of the hundredweight of gold. The tandem set off for the Union Bank where the weighing revealed the two pieces at 6 lb 4 oz 1 dwt and 6 lb 13 dwt, besides which were 16 drafts of 5 lb 4 oz each, making in all 102 lb 9 oz 5 dwt; added to that Dr Kerr has retained upwards of 3 lb as specimens so the total weight of the discovery would be 106 lb recovered from the earth at the one time. [The retails of the discovery are then recounted.]</p>

<p>Gold in SA</p>
<p>Some beautiful specimens of gold rock have been found on a section adjoining the Victoria Mine, the property of J.B. Neales Esq. The gold is in fine laminæ mixed with quartz and sandstone. Two sets of miners have entered into arrangements with Mr Neales to work the lode for the next twelve months, paying him a handsome royalty and a rental for the land as well.</p>

<p>NSW Gold from the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 August.</p>
<p>The richness of the Turon diggings is confirmed. A large proportion of the entire population is earning high wages and there are very few not doing well. [The report then details parcels of gold being despatched by individuals.]</p>
<p>The gold found by Dr Kerr had been purchased for Messrs Thacker &amp; Co. for £4,160. On Tuesday Mr Daniel took it out of the bank to transfer it to Sydney by the mail. It was then taken possession of by Commissioner Hardy for the Government. The position is unclear. Dr Kerr at the time did not have a licence to dig for gold, but surely, having passed into the hands of a third party the payment of a small royalty should see it returned to its purchasers.</p>

<p>Gold in Australia [Editorial]</p>
<p>The editor generally warns against rushing off without being fully informed. He is concerned about the impact of the loss of labour on the colony and while understanding the excitement, trusts hopeful miners will not be lured to disappointment. He undertakes to publish in instalments selections from a helpful pamphlet lately published in Sydney by Rev. W.B. Clarke, MA, Fellow of the Geological Society of London and entitled Plain Statements and Practical Hints respecting the Discovery and Working of Gold in Australia.</p>
<p>26 August 1851, page 3</p>
<p>John Boundy writes to the editor with warnings to those thinking of going to the NSW Goldfields.</p>
<p>About two months ago four miners at the Bremer Mines left to try their luck in NSW. They have returned, determined to earn their living by steady, but constant employment. They say that although there are many instances of individual success, the vast majority are doomed to disappointment. Thousands are starving, with no means of leaving except by begging along the way. The men concerned have returned to the Bremer Mines.</p>

<p>SA Statistics for 1850 are published for land sales, population and immigration and emigration.</p>
<p>Population figures 1844-50 are printed. Those for 1851 were:</p>
<p>Males 35,963 Females 27,737 Total 63,700 Aborigines in settled districts estimated at 3,730.</p>
<p>The migration figures are necessarily rather complicated, but one or two items are interesting.</p>
<p>Each year from 1847 shows a nett loss of population to Melbourne and this was especially marked in 1850 &amp; 1851.</p>
<p>There were nett gains from Sydney.</p>
<p>The only significant arrivals from places other than the UK were from Germany:</p>
<p>1847 +716, 1848 + 907, 1849 + 1,607, 1850 + 1,079.</p>
<p>There were small emigration losses to the UK, but less than 1% of the gains from that source.</p>
<p>Apart from the nett losses to Melbourne the other interesting outflow was to California as a result of the gold rush there. 1847, 0; 1848, 0; 1849 -105; 1850, -650.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mine. The Burra Directors returned from their periodic visit to the Mine on Saturday. The carriage broke down twice on the way to the Mine due to the fearful state of the roads, despite the skill and resources of the indomitable Chambers and the scarcely less illustrious whip, George. Captain Allen used his seafaring skills to make a sapling, borrowed from a neighbouring fence, serve in the place of the original pole, and a disabled axle was securely lashed to get the travellers through to Kooringa. The travellers had a few miles’ walk.</p>

<p>The Labourers’ Meeting [Editorial]</p>
<p>The editor acknowledges that through the winter there has been less than sufficient work for the number of labourers available and that the unemployed behaved with great restraint in their meeting, which resolved to present a memorial to the Government calling for action to create work for them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>1 October 1851, page 1</p>
<p>The Unemployed met yesterday at Victoria Square. Many moving tales were told of their privations. Donations were collected and distributions made to the neediest. Bread etc. was distributed and it is to be hoped that the memorial will result in avenues of meaningful employment being opened.</p>

<p>Victorian Gold. Extract from the Geelong Advertiser</p>
<p>Gold mania has now been raging in Geelong for three weeks and enthusiasm has only been slightly dampened by the bad weather and the appalling roads, which have been virtually impassable. In the last three days the streets have been thronged with people starting for the diggings or preparing to do so. Those unable to leave their commitments to work seem unable to attend to their duties. People having premises built continually have to find replacement labour as workers leave after a week or so. Carpenters will not continue making mining cradles, despite it being more profitable than mining. Some suburban villages are almost without males. Load of wood and water are fetching fabulous sums. General shops are closed and ships are delivering 70 men a day. How long we will have the men to bring out the Daily Advertiser and the weekly Intelligencer it is hard to say. A petition has prayed for an escort between the Buninyong Goldfield and Geelong. Although parcels of gold arrive here daily, it must be only a small fraction of that remaining in the hands of diggers.</p>
<p>Gold digging is now a regular occupation in the Province of Victoria.</p>

<p>A Dreadful Crime at Port Wakefield. On Sunday 13 September Mr Lever, the Landlord of the Port Wakefield Arms, had some words with a mudpuncher named Dugald, who also broke one of his windows. Lever went into his house and returned with a pistol, with which he blew away the whole of the man’s lower jaw and tongue. There was no medical assistance within 40 miles and the victim is not expected to live. Lever made his escape, but we hope by now is in custody. There are no police at Port Wakefield.</p>

<p>SA Gold</p>
<p>J.M. Solomon writes expressing his disappointment at the apparent apathy of the South Australian public when it comes to searching for gold in SA. He suggests a subscription list to establish a reward for the discoverer of gold in payable quantities.</p>
<p>Victorian Gold from the Melbourne Morning Herald, 1 October.</p>
<p>A letter from Buninyong dated 28 September says:</p>
<p>There are far richer diggings here than in California or Sydney. Every man is doing well and our party in four days took 80 pounds weight of gold out of our hole. Goodness knows how much more there might be left there.</p>
<p>At Kyneton so many persons were digging for gold that water-carriers and wood-carriers had deserted their occupations and customers could not get baked break and had resorted to damper.</p>
<p>The Geelong Advertiser has an important letter from a reporter at Ballarat. Surface workings have been abandoned and riches are being pursued underground. The yield is immense and apparently inexhaustible. Tin dishes often yield one or two ounces in a single washing. The wildest reports fall short of the reality. September has proved quite remarkable. Fortunes have been made in a few hours. Diggers who have gone down a hole in the morning have emerged at sunset with a competence.</p>
<p>[The writer adjoins a tabular statement from which a number of amazing facts emerge.]</p>
<p>The table shows that a Ballarat for the period covered there were 143 cradles and 567 men who produced 4,010 ounces worth £12,030 of gold (present value £3 per ounce). The largest production was 314 ounces by 10 men in 14 days. The smallest production was 1 ounce by four men in four days, but 29 parties comprising 112 men, met with no success.</p>
<p>For the whole field the average is 1 oz 6 dwt 2 gr per man per day. This has been calculated on the number of cradles, to which must be added innumerable tin dishes and dispersed cradles.</p>
<p>[The article goes on to talk of gold escorts and to cite sums for individual parties.]</p>

<p>Gold in NSW.</p>
<p>Mr Middleton, formerly of Kooringa, writes to his mother from Turon Diggings in NSW, 11 August.</p>
<p>Mr Gordon, I and another person from Adelaide bought a lot of tools from a person who had made £900 in one week. Hundreds are making money fast, but it is all chance. Two thirds of the people are walking up and down the river looking for a good spot, which it is hard to find. Gold can be found everywhere, but in such low concentrations that it does not repay the labour. We have just cleared our board since arriving here, but hope to get a better place next week. The tools are spades, picks, crow bars and tin dishes. Sometimes we have to dig 12 feet deep and wash all the stones and earth we dig out to get the precious stuff. Gold fetches from £3 to £3-10-0 per ounce. Provisions are very dear. I have seen a great many here from Burra. Some stayed only a day before deciding to return. It is no use coming here without a little money to buy tools to get a start. Some men are working for 15/- to 20/- a week and board because they lack the capital to buy tools. I would recommend those in good employment in SA to stay there. Apart from the chancy nature of the business there are hardships to endure; ‘sleeping under a gum tree, and living on damper and mutton alone, and very often without salt, which is 6d per lb.’</p>
<p>I am told there are places within 30 miles where gold is to be found in great quantities, but the immense influx of water makes it impossible to work there during the winter season.</p>
<p>16 October 1851, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The half-yearly report of the Directors is not as gilded as before, but they have declared a dividend of 200%. Captain Roach’s report is very frank and information and perspicuity.</p>
<p>The expenditure of the Association in SA for the year ending 30 September 1850 was almost a quarter of a million pounds. The effects of this injection into the economy of SA was felt everywhere. In the 12 months to 30 September last the sum expended in SA was £196,315-7-6 and no less that £159,973-8-1 was in channels where it was likely to become immediately and abundantly productive. In wages, salaries, cartage, fodder agency and the preliminary outlay at Karkulto the outlay was £96,753-8-1 and dividends have amounted to £63,220. Additions to our currency have thus more than averaged £3,000 per week.</p>
<p>It appears that the aggregate mineral production of the Burra Burra for the past year has been 23,338 ton of ore, calculated to yield 5,000 tons of metallic copper. Taking this at a round figure to be worth £80 per ton (much below its value in any commercial market), we realise the startling amount of £400,000.</p>
<p>17 October 1851, page 2</p>
<p>SA Gold</p>
<p>It is known that gold has been obtained from the washings in the South Para. Some Germans previously employed at the Wheal Gawler are reported to have found gold to the east of the Murray. While gold has yet to be found in SA in sufficient quantities to justify working, it is present in all the streams flowing from the Mt Lofty Ranges and many think it only a matter of time before discoveries to match Ballarat or Ophir or Turon will be found near the capital.</p>

<p>Mineral Discoveries</p>
<p>A public meeting ahas been called at Kooringa for next Saturday afternoon to consider alternatives to the present system of land purchase for Mineral Lands.</p>
<p>The discovery of gold in neighbouring colonies has sharpened interest in the issue, with the hope of a change before similar discoveries are made in SA. With the threat of a drainage of our labouring classes and the setting in of a pernicious gold fever, how much better it would be if there were a scattering of mines up and down the length of the colony. Under the present system in SA any discoveries are not revealed because people have no guarantee of securing for themselves either the land or an adequate remuneration for their secret.</p>

<p>Gold Fever</p>
<p>It is now useless to shut our eyes to the prospect of a large number of SA labouring men going to the gold-fields of NSW and Victoria, nor should we underestimated the disastrous consequences if at this particular season of the year there are insufficient men to attend to the actual necessities of the colony. There is no doubt that the first group of men to leave for Melbourne may be of a class we are as willing to be rid of as to retain; the idlers, the dissatisfied, the reckless and the wild. The prospects of realizing a fortune by digging in the earth for ready made gold will inevitable also overpower the judgement of many an honest labourer. To try to appeal to prudence and caution will fail when the probabilities of individual success are so magnified.</p>
<p>We can only hope the fever will not be in a particularly malignant form and that the public press, and other forces acting to reduce the fever, will not be entirely ineffective.</p>
<p>The difficulty of abuse of our Emigration Fund will be great indeed. Parties are very likely to use it to get to SA without any intention of staying here, but of moving on to the east immediately.</p>
<p>The discovery of a workable gold field in SA is very desirable at the moment, because it would reduce the abstraction of labour from our territory, though the immediate impact on other industries would be similar.</p>
<p>[The writer goes on to consider ways of forcing or inducing migrants to stay in SA.</p>
<p>We fear the risks of abuse of the Land Fund cannot be much diminished, but we fear that a suspension of emigrant ships we fear would be an even more serious evil.</p>
<p>24 October 1851, page 2</p>
<p>Gold at Melbourne</p>
<p>The mail from Melbourne confirms the ongoing flow of gold to that city, though amounts are not specified. As a result wages for labourers have risen there. The rise is considerable, but so far the greatest amount reported would double the wage rate. On the other hand the news from Sydney Diggings is that the diggings in NSW are said to be terrible. Hospitals and public institutions are said to be crowded with the sick and infirm.</p>
<p>We have seen a further example of gold found within twelve miles of Adelaide.</p>
<p>25 October 1851, page 2</p>
<p>‘An Old Friend’ writes to the editor on the subject of the damage that could be done to the SA Land Fund by people using its funding of emigration to enable them to get to the gold fields. It is also to be feared the Sa Government will be put to the expense of supporting wives and families left destitute when their menfolk go to the diggings. He says the Police Act can be used to inflict a heavy penalty on those who leave their families liable to become a charge upon the public.</p>
<p>[The editor points out an announcement by the Destitute Relief Board that they will not maintain the wives and families of men who have left for the diggings.]</p>
<p>27 October 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Gold at Melbourne</p>
<p>G.B. writes from Melbourne with reports of violence on the goldfields. He says the diggers have become a law unto themselves. They have declared no strangers are tolerated on the fields. 50 men from Sydney have been driven back and a group of Irishmen is being paid by the diggers to enforce their decision. He says the men from Sydney were driven back with loss of life. Only free emigrants from England, landed at Port Phillip will be admitted as diggers. There is also some fear that the SA Government will prevent the shipment of the necessities of life to the diggings.</p>

<p>SA Gold. Mr Williams, who was formerly associated with the discovery of the monster lump of silver-lead at Glen Osmond, showed us a beautiful sample of SA gold yesterday.</p>

<p>News of the discoveries has already reached Hawaii and Mauritius and ships are being readied to bring diggers from those places. We may expect arrivals from further away as the news spreads as the example of California has shown.</p>

<p>Mineral Leases –the Kooringa Public Meeting</p>
<p>A meeting was held in the paddock opposite Paxton Square on Saturday afternoon to discuss what changes were desirable to the present system of selling mineral lands in SA. Mr J.P. Winchombe was voted into the chair in Mr W.R. Mortlock’s absence. The Chairman introduced the topic and said that now seemed the time for change. The Governor, the members of the Legislative Council and the public Press were all in favour of mineral leases. The problem would seem to be in devising an unobjectionable plan for implementing the change.</p>
<p>The first motion stated that the present system was against the best interests of the colony.</p>
<p>The second said that the meeting viewed with pleasure the steps already taken by the Legislative Council to change the system.</p>
<p>The third motion sought to make suggestions to be included in the changes. These included:</p>
<p>The benefit to the discoverer of his discovery to be preserved.</p>
<p>That all lands be able to be obtained at any time for working minerals.</p>
<p>Leases be for at least 21 years.</p>
<p>That the party applying first shall be awarded the lease.</p>
<p>That within three months the lessee shall provide such particulars as the Governor may require and pay a 10% deposit of the upset price of £1 per acre before work commences.</p>
<p>That the land be subject to a rent of 2/- per acre per annum and that the continuance of the lease be dependent upon the constant employment of at least three men in bona fide mining for every 80 acres of the land leased.</p>
<p>The land shall revert to the Crown at the expiration of the lease with the lessee having a preferable claim to the fee simple thereof at £1 per acre.</p>
<p>There was much debate and considerable dissension. After about two hours it was decided to withhold the motions and to appoint a committee of three practical miners with the Chairman to draft a petition to be submitted for approval or amendment to an adjourned public meeting next Wednesday (yesterday) at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Resolutions thanking G.S. Kingston for his support of change in the Legislative Council and the editors of the Register and Observer newspapers for their support. The Kooringa Brass Band enlivened the remainder of the evening with their playing.</p>
<p>31 October 1851, page 2</p>
<p>News from Melbourne by overland mail is conflicting. Numerous adventurers have evidently accumulated 1,999 ounces of gold, which has been received in Melbourne. One lump has been found weighing 7 lb 3 oz and the finder was asking £350 for this.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Daily News has always shown the discoveries in the best light, but now pours scorn on the folly of those parties, who unaccustomed to manual labour, have indulged in vain hopes of a golden harvest, without being prepared to face severe toil and disappointment.</p>
<p>Many unsuccessful persons have returned to Melbourne, but many others who had found the Ballarat diggings preoccupied or unremunerative had moved on to Mount Alexander, but of the prospects there we are not informed.</p>
<p>In contrast to this a letter to Messrs Cleve of Adelaide from correspondents in Melbourne dated 17 October says that the excitement continues to increase. All able-bodied men had gone to the diggings and many are doing well. Others are merely earning wages and some are doing no good at all. The whole appears a lottery.</p>
<p>Another account dated 15 October:</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that the diggings are very rich, but the gold is found only in one vein and that vein is rich only now and then. The gold fever is terrible. Melbourne is quite a deserted place with no drays or carts seen in the streets. The fever has come to the point and has begun to abate. The population is now returning as rapidly as it went. There are some extraordinary stories of gold finding, but only by parties who came at the beginning and took possession of the principal place. Of 15,000 men at the diggings last week, I am sure not 2,000 will get anything near their expectations. According to all appearances we will get here some new and perhaps richer mines than at Sydney, but until such new discoveries are made I would advise no one who is getting a respectable living to come here. Sometimes it is 20 to 25 ft, even through rock to get to the gold, and then it is likely nothing will be found except in the best spots.</p>
<p>The newspaper continues:</p>
<p>It is clear that the atmosphere in Melbourne is clearing and business returning more to normal. The Ballarat Diggings, if not exhausted are at least abundantly preoccupied and either the mass of men now converging on Melbourne must find new fields or occupy themselves with ordinary industrial pursuits. In that case Melbourne will soon be as oversupplied with labour as Sydney is now.</p>

<p>The discussion on this issue is reported at length.</p>
<p>4 November 1851, page 2</p>
<p>Mineral Leases – The Meeting in the North [Editorial]</p>
<p>The editor does not find the conclusion reached at the meeting at Kooringa to be very practicable. He fears that what they ask is beyond the power of the colonial Government to grant. To pursue the matter along these lines, he says, would see it referred to England, when what is required is a quick decision. Everyone agrees that the present system is defective and must be replaced by a system that encourages the industrious discoverer and protects the small buyer and intending adventurer against the monopolist or the land-jobber. He feels this is more readily achieved by a system of purchase than by leasing. He goes on to say that he is convinced that something along those lines can be done by the Colonial government within the current Imperial Act.</p>

<p>Mineral Leases – Kooringa Meeting</p>
<p>J.P. Winchcombe was in the chair.</p>
<p>The petition drawn up included the suggestions:</p>
<p>All Crown land should be obtainable on lease for the raising of ores of metals.</p>
<p>That leases should be for 21 years.</p>
<p>That within three months the lessee shall provide such particulars as the Governor may require and pay a 10% deposit of the upset price of £1 per acre before work commences.</p>
<p>That the land be subject to a rent of 2/- per acre per annum and that the continuance of the lease be dependent upon the constant employment of at least three men in bona fide mining for every 80 acres of the land leased.</p>
<p>The land shall revert to the Crown at the expiration of the lease with the lessee having a preferable claim to the fee simple thereof at £1 per acre. (Subject to a report by two disinterested experienced miners that the land is sufficiently promising for the purpose of raising metalliferous ores to justify a reasonable expectation that mining operations will be pursued thereon.</p>
<p>The chairman then set about explaining the reasoning behind these recommendations.</p>
<p>Mr Powell moved an amendment that the fee simple price by £3 per acre. This was strongly opposed by a miner and one of the drafting committee, and after their speeches Mr Powell agreed to change his amendment to £2. It was put and lost with only Mr Powell supporting it. The petition was then endorsed unanimously. It was decided to act quickly and to let the petition lie in Mr Powell’s shop for six days for signatures.</p>
<p>[One of the speakers had suggested that upwards of two thousand signatures could be expected, if the people had not all left for the Diggings.]</p>

<p>Discovery of Gold</p>
<p>It is reported that gold has been discovered near the Black Rock about 180 miles northeast of Burra by a person called Smith and that Mr McKinley, a stockholder on the Darling has taken a sample to Adelaide and has returned confirming it is gold. A party from Burra has already set out to ascertain the facts.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held on Wednesday 5 November at the Smelters’ Home Hotel on the body of a miner, Arthur Poole, who had been buried alive by a sudden fall of earth on 3 November while at work in the Burra Burra Mine at the 20 fathom level. The jury went to see the body at the Mine Hospital, which was nearby.</p>
<p>William Wren, a lad who worked with the deceased, was sworn. The ground in a certain part of the level had sunk about four feet and in order to get their ore to the surface it was necessary to fill in this gap and make it sound, so they could wheel over the spot. The deceased was placing rubbish into this gap. The sides and roof of the level were supported by substantial timbers with the vertical logs kept in position by large slabs called spreaders. Over the gap was such a spreader. The sinking of the ground had removed earth from under this spreader, which was thus unsupported and unable to bear any weight. The deceased had been wheeling over a plank placed there without interfering with the spreader, but at about 11.30 a.m. the plank needed to be moved and the deceased trod on the spreader to save him from getting into the depression to shift the plank. The spreader sank, the perpendiculars moved together and the roof collapsed, covering the young man. Captain Roach and others responded rapidly, but it was 4.30 p.m. before the body was recovered. He was then quite dead. The witness said that the deceased had no business to tread on the spreader and he considered the place where the accident occurred to be properly and securely timbered.</p>
<p>John Thomas gave corroborative evidence and agreed with the assessment about the adequacy of the timbering.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of Accidental Death. The coroner, George bull, then fined Mr William Hill 10/- for failure to attend as a juror when summoned.</p>
<p>Magistrate’s Court, Kooringa 3 November</p>
<p>George Bevan, Clerk for the Patent Copper Co. appeared to answer an information of Richard Bailey who claimed £27-10-0 unpaid for wood cutting in the Murray Scrub. Bailey said he had an agreement with Mr Williams, Manager of the Copper Works, to cut wood at 2/- per ton and a second agreement for 1/6 more per ton to cut it in shorter lengths. The Copper Company was to send drays to fetch the wood and the cutters were to load it. He had 200 tons ready and the company would not send the drays. Two witnesses corroborated his account.</p>
<p>The company made no defence and was ordered, after some discussion between the parties, to pay £22-10-0 plus 23/- costs.</p>
<p>6 November</p>
<p>William Jenkins, furnace mason at the Copper Company was charged by George Bevan for the company with not performing certain work he was contracted for. George Ewbank said Jenkins had been engaged in England to work as a mason or furnace man and now refused to work the furnace. He had refused both the witness and Leyshon Jones, the foreman of the works. The agreement was produced. The defendant contributed nothing material. The Bench cleared the court and considered the matter. After ten minutes the Bench ruled that Jenkins had to fulfil his contract. Jenkins agreed to return to work and pay 21/- costs to the court.</p>
<p>7 November: the Magistrates were absent.</p>
<p>8 November</p>
<p>Martin Kennedy was charged with being drunk and disorderly and assaulting Sergeant Reid. He was fined 5/- on the first charge and 10/- for the assault.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald applied to the court for a warrant against the Copper Co. for £22-10-0 in accordance with the Bench’s ruling of 3 November. Mr Grant, for the Copper Co. said he had been asked to say by Mr Ewbank that the money would be paid as soon as the wood had been weighed. Mr Fitzgerald said the effect of such a compromise would be to nullify the previous decision. His Worship doubted he could grant the warrant in the absence of the other JP who had made the judgement. Mr Fitzgerald read out the clause of the Masters and Servants Act that said the warrant could be granted by any JP. Dr Bull said he preferred that the matter stand over to the next day.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald had no objection as long as the Bench would inform Mr Ewbank that they could not entertain his proposal and that unless the Money was paid by Monday they would be obliged to grant the warrant of distress. Dr Bull said he would consult his brother Magistrate and Mr Grant would be instructed to reply to Mr Ewbank’s message.</p>
<p>Kooringa Magistrates</p>
<p>The need to appoint a Resident Magistrate in Kooringa is clear from the events of the last few days. On 7 November the Magistrates were absent, which wasted the time of the suitors and other required to attend. On 8 November the hesitation of the Sitting Magistrate to issue a Warrant of Distress in the case of Bailey v. the Patent Copper Co. in confirmation of a previous decision of the Court draws attention to the inadequacy of the arrangements. In considering the absence of the Magistrates on 7 November it must be borne in mind that both are medical men and their professional duties may absolutely prevent attendance at times.</p>
<p>14 November 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa Magistrate’s Court, before Henry Chambers &amp; George Bull. 10 November</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald wanted to know the result of the message Mr Grant was ordered by the Magistrates to convey to Mr Ewbank.</p>
<p>Mr Ewbank said he only wished the payment to be withheld for three weeks so he could ascertain correctly the amount due to the complainant.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald said that under the Masters and Servants Act the Bench had no alternative but to grant a warrant of distress.</p>
<p>Mr Ewbank said he would have no objection to paying the money into Court provided it remained there until all the wood was brought in.</p>
<p>Dr Bull pointed out a clause allowing the defendant the right of appeal and said Mr Ewbank could have availed himself of that option.</p>
<p>After further legal argument it was agreed that half the money be paid now and the remainder in three weeks.</p>
<p>Thomas Viant was charged with being drunk and disorderly in the Miners’ Arms and with assaulting William Richardson. He was fined 5/- for being drunk and 10/- for the assault and ordered to pay 1/6 for broken glasses.</p>
<p>Richard Neagle was charged with obstructing police in the course of their duties and of inciting Viant to resist police. He was fined 20/-.</p>
<p>Mrs Grey of Aberdeen applied for a summons against her husband Zachariah Grey for assaulting her. Granted.</p>
<p>George Watkins was charged with feloniously assaulting Bertha Helling aged 15 with intent etc. Bertha had been sent at about 9.45 p.m., by her employer Mrs Stace of Aberdeen, to the police station to fetch a constable. While she was knocking on the door of the sleeping policemen the prisoner, who was already in custody at the Station, came up and committed the assault. Before he could effect his purpose she was rescued by one of the officers, who had been awakened by her screams. The rest of the evidence is unfit for publication.</p>

<p>Law &amp; Police at Kooringa [Editorial]</p>
<p>[There is a scathing editorial on both the Magistrates and the police at Kooringa.]</p>
<p>Following the removal of Mr Lang from Kooringa the administration of justice had not been more promptly or intelligibly administered.</p>
<p>The police detachment lacks the control he exercised over it and the Court shows an infirmity of purpose, which damages confidence in their judgements and the respect for the law they so hesitatingly administer.</p>
<p>The clearing of the court while the Magistrates discuss in private suggests to the suitors that the Magistrates themselves have serious misgivings as to the extent of their legal knowledge.</p>
<p>[The writer then outlines a situation where Sergeant-Major McCulloch on one day laid an information against a publican claiming it was as the result of repeated problems and on the next court day seeking to withdraw it because he had no wish to press a charge against Mr Taylor who normally conducted his house in an orderly manner. In other words he was virtually admitting that the original information was laid under false pretences. Clearly on either one or both occasions there was evidence of tampering with justice, yet their Worships ‘were content to become the tools of a crafty constable who, in all probability, laid the information to prove his power or to assert his consequence.’</p>
<p>[The writer than reports a case where a prisoner was so laxly supervised that he could leave his place of confinement and almost manage to commit a serious assault on a female before a sleepy policeman-gaoler came to the rescue. The prisoner was committed for trial, but the Magistrates did not even censure the Sergeant-Major for the lax discipline maintained among those under his control.]</p>

<p>Kooringa Weather. Heavy rain has fallen in the past week and it has been unusually cold. On Friday there was a severe fall of hail, which coated the streets and stayed long enough to give the inhabitants a feeling of winter in the midst of summer. On Saturday rain fell in torrents and by 8 p.m. a formidable stream was again flowing down Commercial Street to the dismay and discomfort of residents in the business part of town. On Saturday night it was rough and stormy and this did not abate till Sunday night.</p>

<p>The Ballarat Diggings</p>
<p>Mr Chambers of Adelaide despatched a messenger to report back on the Ballarat Diggings. From the statements we have received life there must be perfectly wretched. The chance of success is perhaps one in a hundred and the gold, when obtained, only to be secured by incessant watchfulness with the necessity of a frequent resort to strong, if not violent measures in self-defence.</p>
<p>Another letter from the diggings says the writes found the diggings nothing remarkable:</p>
<p>A hillside covered with holes in about a quarter of which parties were working, some with luck, but most without success. I have met party after party who have worked several different holes without getting an ounce. One party had spent £90 without getting anything. As to the tin dish-men getting 1⁄4 oz per day, very few managed that and they were those in front of cradles from good holes. The party I am with from Adelaide has not made an ounce yet, though there are seven of them. The work is hard and unhealthy and about one third of the parties spoken to have paid their way. Some have sunk holes to 15 ft and not found 10/- worth. This place is now nearly deserted; about 3,000 or 4,000 left last week for Mount Alexander.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mine. The Directors and Secretary arrived in Kooringa on Tuesday evening. A large group of miners assembled to see them drive in. The Kooringa Brass Band had assembled for the occasion. The Survey took place at the Mine on Thursday and numerous tribute pitches and tutwork bargains were taken at the Captains’ prices, with only a few rejected. The quantity of ore on the surface is still very large, but the weather is now fine and so there is the expectation that it will be speedily removed by the Patent Copper Company, whose works at the Burra are now nearly in full operation. This imparts a stimulus to business in Kooringa, which had been slow due to the long continuance of the wet season.</p>

<p>Kooringa Hospital. A preliminary meeting of those seeking a hospital at Kooringa was held on Friday evening last. W.R. Mortlock took the chair. No business was done except the appointing of J.P.

<p>Obituary/Inquest. Death of the Discoverer of the Burra Burra Mine.</p>
<p>An inquest was held last Friday on the body of Thomas Pickett. He had been engaged in cutting wood in the Murray Scrub for the Burra Copper Works. He had come into Kooringa for the purpose of getting a settlement for his work. He was last seen alive on Tuesday 18 November about 2 p.m. by James Norrell who is also cutting wood for the Copper Works. He was then standing in the doorway of a vacant hut at Hallett’s Springs, about three miles from Kooringa. Norrell spoke to him and found that he was drunk. There was no evidence that he had then received any money from the Patent Copper Company or had money about him. It was common for bullock drivers to stay at the old hut on their journeys and so Pickett’s presence there created no comment. On Thursday 20 November at about 3 p.m. a young 10-year-old boy entered the hut seeking some twine for some childish purpose, and saw the deceased lying on the floor of the hut nearly naked and severely burnt. He told his mother who lives in a hut on the opposite side of the creek. The mother and two other women went to verify the report and told two men who were passing in a spring cart to inform the police. From the position of the body and the medical testimony of Dr Bull, it was clear that the deceased had fallen into the fire while in a state of intoxication and that was the verdict of the jury. [This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD.]</p>

<p>Kooringa-Port Wakefield</p>
<p>In the last week at Port Wakefield two ships and four barques, two brigs and eight barges were loading or unloading and 2,000 tons of copper ore were on wharves waiting shipment. Average daily arrival of overland traffic from Burra Burra is 40 drays. The dredging has allowed in one day the amount of loading and unloading previously taking ten to twelve days. The creek is now accessible to barges all the time except for about three days per month on the lowest of tides.</p>

<p>Local Court, Kooringa, 26 November</p>
<p>Mr Milton sought to recover £10 for the loss of a bullock to which he laid claim, which had been taken away by Mr Stephens. Milton said he had bought the bullock for £2-12-0 at Gawler River on 28 July. On 20 October Stephens had taken it away from a boy who then had charge of it. Judgement was for the defendant; their worships having determined that the bullock had been twice sold and the second sale was illegal.</p>
<p>Thompson &amp; Kekwick sought £15 for goods sold and delivered to McCumber. The case was not defended and judgement was given to for the plaintiff in the full amount.</p>
<p>Captain Richard Goldsworthy sough £15 for 10 head of cattle given into the care of Mr Neale to be grazed on his run. He had several times sought their return and now three were missing. Neale admitted receiving the cattle, but without responsibility. Their Worships decided that as there was no agreement to the contrary, the defendant was responsible for the cattle and gave a verdict for the plaintiff for £10 and costs.</p>

<p>Victorian Gold. Yesterday the escort from Mount Alexander brought down 11,424 oz or nearly half a ton of gold. We learn also that a further 6,000 oz were brought to the Commissioner’s tent for transport, but were refused for fear of overloading the vehicle. As it was it broke down twice and was detained several hours in consequence.</p>
<p>The total for the Ballarat Escort and the Geelong Escort was 13,169 oz; worth (at £3 per oz) £39,507.</p>
<p>Needless to say a great deal of the gold gathered does not find its way to the metropolis by escort at all.</p>

<p>Gold [Editorial]</p>
<p>Mr Waterhouse has given notice of a motion with respect to the issuing of licences to search for gold in SA on Crown Lands and also with reference to a geological survey of the colony.</p>
<p>We should hope the Government would not wait on a vote before issuing licences. It is notorious that many are seeking gold without authorization. It is no wonder that they conceal their discoveries. This cannot be to the good of the colony. Adventurers returning from Ballarat and Mount Alexander comment on the similarities between the hills there and those here. No work here has yet gone beneath the surface and yet in NSW &amp; Victoria it has often been found in pits and wells sunk beside creeks and reaching considerably below the upper strata.</p>

<p>Messrs Carey &amp; Wren have sent in an application to the Government for the discovery of several ounces of gold in a locality where 100 men can find remunerative employment in gold digging. We understand that His Excellency is likely to make regulations that the reward be paid out of licence fees for gold digging. We understand Messrs Carey &amp; Wren are willing to their claim being tested by this means.</p>
<p>Mr Morris of the Lunatic Asylum has drawn attention to specimens from the vicinity of Cox’s creek.</p>
<p>An offer was recently made to Messrs Matthew Smith and Phillip Levi by parties wishing to work for gold in sections on the Torrens formerly known as the Riversedge Mine, for 10% of the amount produced. The offer was declined. And Messrs Smith and Levi now have a party working there.</p>

<p>Victorian Gold</p>
<p>News with the Elizabeth says 39 men have returned from the diggings and those intending to return will not do so, we are told, till March because water has become exceedingly scarce and brackish. Living there is very hard and expensive and dysentery is common. A rest from the hard labour is seen as necessary for even the stoutest frames.</p>
<p>Many who intend to return will take their wives and families with them. Three Germans who have come back are said to have acquired £75 each in a fortnight at Mt Alexander, where gold has been found in abundance. The largest authenticated account gives the number of diggers as 15,000.</p>
<p>The Geelong Intelligencer of 6 December says the rate of extracting gold in the last few weeks would, if maintained for a year, yield £5,000,000 or half the annual produce of California. It is not unlikely that within twelve months our exports of the precious metal will equal that of California.</p>
<p>[The Register continues to caution against going to the diggings; at least until March and gives some other details.]</p>
<p>NSW Gold</p>
<p>Several new discoveries are reported in NSW. Fine gold has been found within five miles of Albury. It is granular, small, but plentiful.</p>
<p>22 December 1851, page 3</p>
<p>SA Gold. Some 400-500 men have gathered in the vicinity of Mount Gambier since the announcement of the discovery of gold near there. We have been unable to get any definite information about the discovery.</p>
<p>Some Germans are vigorously prosecuting the search for gold near the Victoria Mine and are hopeful of earning the £1,000 reward being offered.</p>
<p>We understand that more than 100 miners have arrived in Adelaide from Kooringa and that of them 26 are Germans. Of the total number 45 came by omnibus.</p>
<p>24 December 1851, page 3</p>
<p>Mount Alexander. A former compositor for the Register (W.W.) writes from the diggings:</p>
<p>Been here 3 weeks</p>
<p>It was a desolate 80 mile walk from Melbourne with neither houses nor shelter.</p>
<p>It took a week, with luggage on a bullock dray.</p>
<p>Our first search was fruitless.</p>
<p>Joined in then with a rush to a new site with 1,000 or so others, but got very little in our first week.</p>
<p>The second week yielded 2 oz per man after extremely hard work and great privations.</p>
<p>On the Saturday ending the second week it rained and hailed in bucketfuls; all was thoroughly drenched.</p>
<p>In the last week we got gold worth c. £8 each, but that is little enough recompense for the labour and privations.</p>
<p>Some here strike it lucky, but I have seen parties who after three weeks have not enough to pay for their expenses home.</p>
<p>Licences cost 30/- a month, so we will go on for a few weeks longer.</p>
<p>Some parties have dug nine holes without any luck.</p>
<p>To my late companions: ‘My sincere advice to them and all others who find themselves comfortable at home, is to remain there, as gold-hunting, to 19 out of 20, is not such a mode of making a future as many suppose.’</p>

<p>Gold in SA. The population of the tiny town of Macclesfield turned out en masse on Friday because of the alleged discovery of gold in the neighbourhood. Some small particles of the metal were detected in the banks of a creek, but nothing of any significance was discovered.</p>
<p>Overland to Victoria. Having talked to some who have returned overland from the diggings we learn that their sufferings have been very great from lack of water. Many of the travellers are worn out with fatigue and wanting food without the means to procure it. Many horse carts are abandoned in the desert east of the Murray; their horses added to other teams. Bags of flour and other heavy items lie abandoned at watering places, so great is the rush to obtain water. Many bullocks in the teams have died.</p>

<p>The New Year</p>
<p>[The editor is hopeful that the great exodus of labour to the eastern colonies’ goldfields will not continue and become a major economic problem for the colony. He hopes the recently announced discoveries of gold in SA, some of them near the capital, will keep many would-be gold miners in SA. He says that while not wishing to induce those to remain who might have a fair prospect of success, the paper is anxious to be scrupulous in publishing all the information favourable and unfavourable so that decisions will be well informed. Vicissitudes in the fortunes of the colony are to be expected and at present many are anxious due to the fears of depopulation from the disappearance of labour to the diggings. The writer hopes the worst fears may be unjustified. His hopes for 1852 include the cessation of transportation of convicts to Van Diemen’s Land, the establishment of direct steam communication with England, a considerable extension of agriculture, progress in building a railway to Port Adelaide, an increase in Government revenue, a Legislative Council improved by experience and in general peace and prosperity.]</p>

<p>SA Gold. It is rumoured that gold has been discovered on the Light about four miles from Kapunda. We suspect it to be an exaggeration of an earlier rumour. The rumour at Burra, that 40 miners had, as a consequence, left Kapunda, is not true.</p>
<p>A great number of parties did leave Adelaide yesterday to prosecute searches on the basis of reports by Mr Stephen. It is reasonable to hope that in a few days the best hopes may be realised.</p>

<p>SA Gold</p>
<p>We regret to say that the reported gold field at Mitchell’s Flat [Lenswood] whence Mr Stephen was said to have procured gold, has turned out not to exist. Some 400 to 500 persons went there and on Saturday Mr G.M. Waterhouse, Mr Babbage, the Crown Ranger and Mr Stephen appeared there. Many set to work with vigour, but not a grain of gold was discovered. Mr Stephen was addressed in terms more plain than polite and it is feared the whole thing was a hoax. When apparently credible authority then said gold had been found near Lobethal by some Germans, none of the men at Mitchell’s Flat could be induced to go there. The Commissioner of Crown Lands is yet to report on a second visit to Sixth Creek and we have no authoritative report on claims that gold has been discovered on the Light.</p>

<p>‘HASTA’ writes to the editor expressing his view that if SA does not possess gold deposits, it nevertheless could have great wealth in other metalliferous minerals. There are many reports of copper discoveries and the sooner the lease arrangements are settled the better. He says that half a dozen people have applied for leases and these could prove of vital importance to the colony. He hopes for more Burras.</p>
<p>14 January 1852, page 3</p>
<p>Henry Marshall writes to the editor expressing his concern that if gold is not found in SA the colony will miss out on the huge number of emigrants that are bound to head to Australia once the new of the gold discoveries reached the UK. It is therefore vitally important that SA’s other mineral deposits are discovered and exploited and hence that the leasing arrangements are put in order. Marshall considers the present leasing arrangements totally inadequate.</p>

<p>The Overland Route to Mount Alexander</p>
<p>[A lengthy editorial article examines the overland routes to the gold fields. The southern route via Portland Bay is longer than a more direct route through the Murray Scrub. This route is deficient in water and the Government is considering making it available by tapping water that is known to exist at depths of 50-60 ft. If it were made available at quite moderate cost, this route could also become the mail route.]</p>

<p>Consideration is now being given to the means of establishing communication between SA and the gold districts by means of steam navigation on the Murray, which is declared practicable for nearly 700 miles, the average depth between Goolwa and the junction with the Darling was more than 11⁄2 fathoms in 1850. The upper Murray runs to within 60 miles of Mount Alexander and Albury is also in a gold region. Except in extraordinary dry years the Murray would be navigable to Albury by craft with a draft for 4 to 5 ft.</p>

No apprehension exists as to the leaving of the men and with plenty of fuel on hand no check to smelting is anticipated. At Dry Creek the Directors passed the cylinder for the great engine, which had left Port Adelaide on Friday. Mr Freeman is, as on previous occasions, managing the conveyance of the equipment.</p>

<p>Victorian Gold</p>
<p>The market fluctuated this week. It began at £2-18-0 per oz, and rose slowly to £3-0-6 before closing at £3.</p>
<p>The Forest Creek Diggings seem still the most productive. Five Adelaide miners returned to town this week, having realized no less than 250 lb, valued at £9,000 at the week’s closing price. Some of them intend returning to England with their gold, considering they have made their fortune. There is considerable gold in town in the hands of diggers. Some are holding on to it, expecting its price to rise. Others are disposing of it to meet their current needs.</p>
<p>From the opening of the Victorian goldfields to date 220,305 oz have been shipped from Melbourne and Geelong, valued at £660,915.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. The Burra Mail was involved in a fatal accident at Gawler last Friday. The mail from Burra did not reach Gawler till 9.30 p.m. on Friday, the roads being so heavy due to the rain. On turning into the main street, the driver checked the horses to avoid a dangerous hole in the middle of the road and having avoided that, the horses trotted on. Scarcely 100 yards further on it was found that the pole had snapped off. The road was on an incline and the driver found it impossible to prevent the coach from running on the horses. As a result they became unmanageable and the coach tipped over 50 yards from the Post Office. When lights had been obtained it was found that Patrick Joyce, a farmer from near the Catholic Chapel on the Light, had been killed on the spot.</p>
<p>His body was lying in a confusion of luggage. Several other passengers were injured, including J.W. Macdonald, the Special Magistrate, returning from holding court in Burra. He had a deep gash on his forehead and severely injured a knee.</p>
<p>An inquest was held on Saturday at the New Bushman Inn on the body of Patrick Joyce.</p>
<p>His injuries are described as a fractured skull, two broken collarbones, a dislocated right arm, dislocated thigh and four or five broken ribs. The fractured skull or the broken ribs would have been adequate to have caused death. The driver was George Beams and the Guard Thomas Simpson. Simpson gave evidence along the lines of the story above. Beams corroborated the account. He said the pole had been broken previously, but had been mended in Kooringa and Friday’s break had been in another place. J.W. Macdonald gave evidence and completely exonerated the driver. The verdict was death by accident and misadventure. The jury did, however, recommend that Mr Chambers keep one or two spare poles along the road.</p>
<p>[Patrick Joyce died 30 January 1852 aged 50. His residence was described as near Kapunda.]</p>

<p>Absentees &amp; Their Families</p>
<p>[There is a long editorial on the problems caused by the mass movement of men to the goldfields. It begins by hoping that the recently passed Act will be successful in saving the colony from ruin. The article does not make clear what this Act is or does, but it was the Bullion Act. The main thrust of the article concerns the problems created when departing diggers left families unprovided for. The writer foresaw huge problems because by this time ship were taking 700 to 800 a week and vast numbers were now taking the overland route. Since it was safe to assume that while some would meet with success, many would not. Those leaving now were ignoring the advice to wait for the break of season when water would be available. A rapid increase in the numbers in desperate need of assistance was to be expected. The resolution that the Destitute Board would not aid families of men at the digging would have to be abandoned. The Government would also have to make arrangements for an overland escort for conveying gold to Adelaide.]</p>

The monster cylinder belonging to the new engine for the Burra Burra Mine arrived at the Mine last Thursday without any casualty or accident, although the creeks were high and the road in many places was boggy after the recent heavy rains. The number of bullocks employed was 60-70 during the entire distance and the weight they had to draw was not less than 27 tons. All the bridges were strongly supported and Mr Freeman spread sand ballast on their roadways to prevent vibration. All survived without damage.</p>

<p>Confessions of a Gold Seeker – a letter signed I.X.</p>
<p>Our party of four men sailed from Port Adelaide in the Margaret Brock on Monday 22 December 1851. We reached Port Phillip the following Sunday. It was impossible to find lodgings and we spent Monday night in a deserted house with a group of four Germans. The next day we got breakfast with some difficulty and eventually found a man who engaged to take us to the diggings. We paid him £1 each for taking our carpet-bags etc. and for the privilege of walking alongside his cart. After about 2 miles he left us to camp at a filthy waterhole and returned to Melbourne with his horse. He returned about 4.30 p.m. and we continued. The landscape looked like a vast sheep run. After three days we had gone 30 miles and we camped in a wood and endured a miserably cold and wet night. On the sixth day we arrived at the diggings, which had the appearance of a giant graveyard. The diggers looked grim and anxious. The slaughter-yards exhaled a vile stench. We recognised many men, but they were too absorbed in their activities to pass the time of day. Provisions were cheaper than we expected. My friends left me in charge of the tent and luggage for a few hours and, it being a hot day, I suffered sunstroke, becoming giddy and subject to violent retching. Eventually my three mates returned. I spent a fitful night with sleep punctuated by pistol shots, barking dogs and the sound of horses and hobbles. We set to work the next day and in four days had struck pipe-clay at 10 ft, despite bouts of dysentery. We had obtained about two ounces of gold, but by them I was too weak to continue. I started for Melbourne with a damper and a driver of a cart who took £1 for the conveyance of by bundles. After five miles, while watering the horses, the whole affair ended up in the water and emerged covered with mud, dust and water. Four miles on, we stopped for tea and ate the damper after peeling off a layer of mud. [He then continues describing a miserable trip to Melbourne lasting several more days.]</p>
<p>After a night at the Freemasons Family Hotel I procured employment and lodgings, among those whose coarseness of language and behaviour repelled. The night was spent in a room occupied by a drunken snoring man, thousands of bedbugs and a multitude of mosquitoes. I did not sleep a wink and at before dawn had fled. By the next night I had managed to find lodgings with a respectable family, with whom I stayed for three weeks before taking the Maid of Auckland to Port Adelaide on Sunday 1 February and reached Adelaide on Monday 9 February.</p>
<p>‘I have only to add that I believe gold to exist in Victoria in vast abundance, yet that hundreds are there who curse the day that they left South Australia and that there is more morality observable at the diggings than in Melbourne.’ I shall probably go again to the diggings when the rains set in, but I would not take my family to reside in Melbourne.</p>
<p>W.H. writes from Forest Creek, 25 January 1852.</p>
<p>[He reports having been there for 10 days without any success yet. The party had sunk five holes varying from 8 to 20 ft deep, but found nothing. It was very hard work. He says of those around that some have made fortunes, but the majority have barely made decent wages. The area is honeycombed with holes, making walking at night very dangerous. Scores of men, he says, are leaving in disgust at the way they have to live. The costs are excessive. He does not advise coming at present with water so scarce.]</p>

<p>Migration from the Burra</p>
<p>The vacant acre between King William and Weymouth Streets near the Post Office was enlivened on Monday night by an overland party and their three drays on the way from the Burra to Mount Alexander. The party comprised the drivers, their wives and families, numbering at least 20 persons. One man spoke of leaving his little cottage at the Burra, for which a month ago he was offered £20, but which he had now sold, together with 30/- worth of firewood, for a mere 10/-. His party, he said, had ten drays, but seven were a stage behind. They anticipate making 15 miles a day, having been informed there is plenty of feed.</p>

<p>Mt Alexander Diggings</p>
<p>A.R. writes a letter to a gentleman in Adelaide.</p>
<p>[He says they were four days sailing to Melbourne and four days by bullock cart getting from Melbourne to the diggings. (80 miles.) Two days after arriving they began sinking. There were 1,000 men sinking on the same hill. After a week they had a hole 20 feet deep. Many got nothing, but they were lucky and recovered 2 pounds of gold. They expect to finish in another week. He considers that of all those there, 5% are making their fortunes, 45% make good wages and 50% are starving. Hundreds are arriving daily from Adelaide and half stop only a day or two. He reports hundreds of Adelaide people starving. He then gives specific information about individuals.]</p>

He wishes he had stayed home, having endured bowel complaints, colds and other problems, though quite well as he writes. He intends to stay until the wet weather makes success more likely or until he gets at least £10. He will then return to Adelaide and ‘take care how I leave it again’.]</p>

<p>The Gold Fields News, per the Daphne</p>
<p>The gold escort to Melbourne from Mount Alexander on 27 February brought 21,000 ounces of gold.</p>
<p>Mr Tolmer (SA Police Commissioner) has arrived to announce a regular escort has commenced between Adelaide and the diggings. He announced on behalf of the Government in Adelaide a price of £3-11-0 per ounce.</p>
<p>Although water was becoming ever scarcer the output of gold is likely to remain high, there being at least 25,000 diggers at the field.</p>
<p>The escort from Ballarat, arriving at Melbourne on 25 February, started with only 131 oz 8 dwt of which it left 101 oz at Geelong.</p>

<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Company</p>
<p>An advertisement recently in the London Times announced that an English &amp; Australian Copper Company was about to be formed with a capital of £350,000, of which the whole was to be paid up.</p>
<p>The Times on 1 December commented:</p>
<p>The company is in the hands of parties of experience and respectability, and the object is to carry on certain works already established at Swansea and in SA. These works have previously been carried on by a private association of a few persons and their transfer to a joint stock body is stated to be on account of their increasing size and importance. A contract has been made with the Burra Burra Company for smelting the whole of the ore from that mine for five years from 1 October 1851, upon receiving a fixed proportion of the produce, and the process is to be conducted under the exclusive possession of Napier’s patent, which applies to France, the United States and the colonies as well as to Great Britain. The assignment of this patent, together with the works, lands, wharfs, etc. is to be taken from the existing proprietors upon the terms at which they are now held, and upon condition of allowing to those parties for five years one half of the net profits after dividends of 15% shall have been paid to the shareholders.</p>

<p>The South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal has ceased publication.</p>
<p>[The reason for the closure of the journal was the withdrawal of many of the staff to the Victorian diggings, which had firstly forced a reduction in size, but now made it impossible to continue, as the remaining workers were about to follow the example of their friends.]</p>

<p>Arrival of the 1st Gold Escort Direct from Mt Alexander</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon the First Gold Escort with Captain Tolmer emerged into view from the picturesque Mt Lofty Ranges, having performed a most arduous and important duty. They were joyfully and honourably welcomed into the city, where their journey terminated in King William Street between the Treasury and the GPO. Captain Tolmer supervised the transfer of the treasure to the strong vault and took about 400 letters to the Post Office.</p>
<p>[A long list of recipients of the gold is printed. It extends for about 12⁄3 columns, giving the names of the dispatcher, the recipient and the amount. This was later criticised as information for would-be robbers.]</p>
<p>Over 4,000 persons greeted Captain Tolmer at Mt Alexander when he explained the Bullion Act and the intentions of the SA Government. Many intelligent questions were asked of him and on hearing his answers the meeting expressed their confidence in the SA Government and the SA Police. Captain Tolmer said there would be no charge on this first experimental escort, but the meeting resolved they would willingly pay 2%. They stated that they would still clearly be better off than risking the hazards, delays and vexatious charges of remittance via Melbourne.</p>
<p>[The article then goes on to talk of changes in the Assay Office and the problems about actually getting cash for the gold delivered.]</p>

<p>Victorian Gold Fields</p>
<p>[A letter from Victoria reports:</p>
<p>That scarcity of water has driven people away from Mount Alexander in their hundreds in the last fortnight.</p>
<p>The New Gully, Red and White Hills and Adelaide Gully Flat have all experienced their own rushes, but none produced a great quantity of gold.</p>
<p>The rush in now to Bendigo Creek for which diggers have left Mount Alexander in their hundreds.</p>
<p>Friar’s creek continues to produce, but is inconvenient for water.</p>
<p>The Golden Gully is nearly worked out.</p>
<p>Along the Lodden the digging is not worth while; the gold being so light and leafy as to float out of the tin dishes.</p>
<p>Salisbury Gully and others too numerous to mention have been failures.</p>
<p>Mr Tolmer’s visit created a sensation at Forest Creek, where most diggers were South Australian and the high price offered and the efficiency of the escort will secure for Adelaide a large importation.</p>
<p>And a description of Ballarat reports that at the end of February at Golden Point and Brown Hill there were 472 men, 52 women and 6 children. It goes on to detail actual weights of gold obtained by a whole series of parties.</p>
<p>[Given that many of the parties are reported to have obtained more than a pound of gold in a week of less, this report was very encouraging.]</p>

<p>A Letter from the Diggings: Forest Creek Mount Alexander, 7 March 1852.</p>
<p>[This is quite a long letter, from which I note a few points.]</p>
<p>It took four days to walk to the diggings from Melbourne.</p>
<p>It was seven miles from the head of the diggings to where the writer was working.</p>
<p>Fryer’s Creek and the Lodden were equally extensive. Bendigo Creek was about 30 miles off and people were going there because of better water and feed for the horses.</p>
<p>The ten acres site where the writer was working had two or three holes a fortnight ago and now there was not a foot of level space left.</p>
<p>He was carting their stuff 4 miles to get water to wash it and it costs16/- -20/- per half a ton.</p>
<p>The dust was intolerable.</p>
<p>In a week his group of three had won 6 oz 17 dwt, which he thought a good beginning. (In a post-script written three days later he says they then had 1 lb 15 dwt.)</p>
<p>Since Mr Tolmer’s visit the price of gold had risen. Previously it was £2-16-0 to £2-18-0 per oz and had then risen to £3 or more. (Tolmer was guaranteeing £3-11-0.)</p>
<p>Water there was scarce and drying up and their tent by a good water hole was about four miles from their work.</p>
<p>Provisions were excessively dear, except for meat. Feed for horses was also dear and hay not to be had. Even the sheet of paper he was writing on had cost him 3d.</p>

<p>The Overland Route to Mount Alexander</p>
<p>Mr J. McLaren the Deputy Surveyor-General reports having sunk nine wells along the route and found good water in seven. The distance between water is now 8-17 miles and in one place 20 miles. This makes the Hundred Mile Scrub between Wellington and Tatiara practicable for drays. Regular overland traffic for good and passengers should be attempted before long. Perhaps the Victorian Government will be inspired by this example to improve the communications between Mount Alexander and Melbourne.</p>

<p>South Australians at Mt Alexander</p>
<p>A large meeting of South Australians was held at Mt Alexander on 29 March. G.M. Waterhouse, the Member for East Torrens, took the chair. The object was to petition the SA Government to continue the Overland Gold Escort and the Overland Mail to the diggings from Adelaide. Mr Waterhouse was cheered on arriving. He said the recent arrival of Captain Tolmer was an experimental trip. It had been done to improve the deplorable economic state of affairs that had fallen on SA like an avalanche due to the gold discoveries and it now behoved all SA diggers to support the move. The Government had been negotiating with the mail contractor ‘Jemmy’ Chambers with respect to an overland mail service. The Chairman felt that the Government would establish an overland mail route as soon as it was demonstrated to be practical. Mr H. Mildred then moved the continuation of the Overland Gold Escort. Mr Nathan Hailes seconded. In doing so he also alluded to the very unreliable nature of sea mails to SA. Many letters had not been delivered and many of those contained money. The resolutions being passed, a petition was drafted soliciting their implementation. [The text of the petition to the Governor is printed.]</p>
<p>‘A Real Miner’ writes to the Editor on gold digging in SA:</p>
<p>Opinion is divided in SA on whether or not the discovery and development of gold fields in SA would benefit the colony. I believe it would.</p>
<p>While the Bullion Act is both necessary and effective, it could be undermined if other colonies followed suit. It should therefore not be the colony’s sole hope. The discovery and working of gold here will not lessen the availability of labour for agriculture as much as when people go further off. Shepherds and hut-keepers will continue to be available from the ranks of unsuccessful diggers. As to the objection that work on roads and other public investments would cease; if the prosperity of Victoria means we are getting no income, this work will cease anyway. The discovery of gold is in no way an unmixed blessing, but if we are going to have our labour moving, let them move to another part of our own province. Port Phillip is now benefiting from the services of all the unsuccessful diggers. The very poor cannot get back to SA. If the Bullion Act is good then real diggings must be even better.</p>

<p>The Overland Gold Escort</p>
<p>‘A Friend’ writes to the Editor expressing his concern about the imminent arrival of the Gold Escort. Last time, he says, the names of people receiving gold and the amount of it was published in the paper. This is an invasion of privacy and has the potential to lead to robberies. He hopes Captain Tolmer will adopt a more discrete policy this time.</p>

<p>D.D. reports on The Gold Diggings, writing from Melbourne 7 April 1852.</p>
<p>The Gold Escort to Melbourne delivered yesterday 12,873 oz from Mt Alexander and 935 oz from Ballarat.</p>
<p>It is thought most gold comes by Escort as the road is too unsafe for diggers to carry it themselves.</p>
<p>The influx of bad characters, especially from Van Diemen’s Land, has made robberies and murders common.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are 50,000 at the diggings. Calculations suggest that the gold produced represents an average income per digger of only 10/6 per week.</p>
<p>Fears are expressed that there will be a great number of deaths when winter sets in as very few diggers are housed in huts to resist the wet and cold.</p>
<p>[The article discusses other aspects of the impact of gold on Melbourne and describes the robbery of the Nelson, in which thieves took some £25,000 worth of gold.]</p>

<p>Billy and Jemmy, two Aboriginal men were charged with the wilful murder of Robert Richardson, shepherd at Younguna on 14 March 1852. Johnson Frederick Hayward gave evidence of seeing the body of the deceased who had spear wounds in the spine and loins and whose head was knocked to pieces. Two bloodied waddies were found nearby. Sergeant-Major William Ross gave evidence of tracking and capturing the prisoners. Billy had a very peculiar foot, which was readily identified as being at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p>The prisoners were remanded for eight days to be brought up at Kooringa for re-examination.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association held its AGM yesterday at its Adelaide Office. The Directors report that the Victorian Gold discoveries had induced two thirds of their miners to leave. Nevertheless 5,709 tons of ore had been raised in the past six months, equal to 11,418 tons in a full year. The average profit is stated to be £5-2-1 per ton, so that the present and prospective profit for the year is £58,000. The return of so many of the miners from Victoria and their settling down at Burra is doubly satisfactory and vouches for the goodness of the employment. The Copper Company has issued assurances that it has a stock of fuel and other appliances sufficient to guarantee continued operations through the winter.</p>
<p>The conveyance to the mine of those ponderous iron castings, which are to compose the Monster Pumping Engine, have been accomplished and the engine will be in operation next August. This will allow productive operations at the deeper levels. The Directors expect a large immigration. We are told that the payment of dividends will shortly be resumed and there is no reason to fear another suspension of them. The last 18 months operations have swelled the estimated total of undivided profits to £167,612-17-9, of which £89,834-6-3 is available for dividends.</p>
<p>23 April 1852, pages 2 &amp; 3</p>
<p>Prospects for SA Farmers</p>
<p>The approaching ploughing season poses a number of questions. Many of the usual labourers in agriculture have now left the colony to become consumers rather than producers. There is to be an expected influx of migrants to the goldfields and an increased demand for flour. Another complication is that once attracted to the speculative occupation of digging for gold many seem reluctant to settle back into their accustomed practices of labour. Nevertheless the producers of grain in this colony can confidently expect to receive a good price for their produce in the coming years. Their principal apprehension is the possibility of imported flour from the US and South America. We think this fear is unfounded. It is unlikely to seem profitable to the North American supplier to send flour to Australia at prices that would injure local producers. The South American product is of inferior quality so that SA flour would always command a premium price. Competition from Van Diemen’s Land will be reduced due to their loss of labour to the goldfields.</p>

<p>The Governor’s Trip to the North</p>
<p>Sir Henry and Lady Young returned on Thursday from their northern trip of 16 days. They went as far north as Charlton, the station of Messrs White in the Mount Remarkable District, about 160 miles from Adelaide. They travelled north via Gawler, Auburn, Watervale, Penwortham, Clare Bungaree Station, Bundalier Station [Bundaleer] and on to Charlton. Their return was via Booboorai [Booborowie] Burra Burra, Karkulto, Apoinga, Anlaby, Koonunga, Nooriootpa [Nuriootpa], Angaston, Flaxman’s Valley, Lyndoch Valley, Pewsey Vale, Mt Crawford and Trial Hill. Everywhere the Governor was received with liberal hospitality. A depot for the reception of imports and exports at the head of Spencer Gulf has been represented to the Governor as essential.</p>

<p>Arrival of the Gold Escort</p>
<p>The second Gold Escort arrived safely in Adelaide yesterday with 1,620 lb weight of gold worth £70,000 and 1,530 letters. Many people went out to greet the arrival. About 3 p.m. those waiting at vantage points on East and South Terraces with telescopes saw a dark animated mass emerge from the Glen. The first Escort had turned off west of St John’s Church and then entered the city via Pulteney and Rundle Streets. This time Mr Chambers took a direct course to and through Victoria Square and thence down King William Street to the Treasury. The strong, but compact vehicle holding the treasure was drawn by five horses. It took about 15 minutes to unload the gold and during this Mr Paxton mounted the cart and proposed three cheers for the Escort. Cheers were also accorded Mr Commissioner Tolmer, Mr J. Chambers, Mr J. Fisher, the policemen and the Gold Diggers. The procession then went to the Bank of Australasia and gave three groans; then to the Bank of SA and the Union Bank, each of which received three cheers in accordance to the respective responses of the banks to the Bullion Act. The next stop was Government House where more than three cheers were given and the band played God Save the Queen.</p>
<p>The Governor addressed the Escort within the grounds of Government House. The procession then escorted Mr Chambers home. [But the Register’s reported did not accompany them. He had noticed a lurking devil under Jemmy Chamber’s cap and also his revolver, conspicuously displayed in his belt, and fearing that it might somehow go off, he stayed away; ‘nobody knows who may be shot in a crowd, even though he should happen to be a Special Reporter.</p>

<p>Proposed Aid for Unsuccessful Diggers</p>
<p>We cannot agree with proposals to send several vessels at public expense to bring home unsuccessful diggers from Melbourne. No doubt hundreds would avail themselves of the opportunity. It has been said that they are needed in SA for shearing and harvest. Many such workers are of unsettled pursuits and habitation. While some may have made their fortunes and withdrawn from the labouring class, a knowledge of the habits of the greater number suggests that they have wasted or will waste the fruit of their exertions as fast as they made it. We think that this class of men could be lured by to SA with the guarantee of employment, the employer guaranteeing the cost of passage. This could be arranged through the services of the SA Commissioner at the diggings, the labourer undertaking to work on subsistence until the passage money had been repaid. This is no different in principal from engagements made every day in Adelaide.</p>
<p>14 June 1852, page 2</p>
<p>Assistance to Unsuccessful Diggers</p>
<p>A Memorial is being presented to The Governor to use some of the Land Fund to pay the passage of retuning diggers, who would then repay the cost from their wages. [The memorial also suggested that bad debts would be recovered from the general revenue.] We have already expressed our disagreement with this or similar proposals. This proposal in particular has the disadvantage that it could encourage other colonies in the future to use their funds to pay labour to move to them in times of need – and Victoria and NSW would have considerable funds from the issue of Gold Licences, which could be so used.</p>

<p>John Hardy writes to the editor:</p>
<p>Having a wife and six children I decided to try to get my fortune at the diggings. We left Port Adelaide 18 April and endured a tedious passage of 17 days to Port Phillip. On the way my son aged 11 years and 4 months was swept overboard and drowned. [He then recounts his difficulties in Melbourne; being robbed and unable to get conveyance to the diggings due to rain. After 14 days in the city, which he describes in very grim terms, they decided to return to SA, and were very glad to do so.]</p>

Horn, who has lately been in charge of the company’s interests at Port Wakefield. Mr Walters intends to purchase a number of mules in South America and to send them to SA under the care of Mr Horn. It is intended to try using mules to conduct the company’s carriage operations between Burra and Port Wakefield in place of bullock drays, which are now idle for want of drivers. Many stations in NSW now have their rations and produce conveyed by means of mules.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. An accident occurred to the Burra mail cart crossing the River Light on the Adelaide side of Kapunda. The mail cart from Burra on Monday evening crossed without trouble. Mr Opie’s coach an hour later became jammed against the bank when the horses turned round in the stream. The passengers endured the position all night and were released in the morning without injury. The driver, William Newman and a passenger known as Billy the Pieman managed to escape during the night and reached the Adelaide side.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning the Burra mail from Adelaide dared not cross the swollen stream and was delayed from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Then a man crossed from the north on horseback without apparent difficulty. The mail arrived from Adelaide driven by John Nash and William Newman and Billy got seats on the mail cart to return to the Kapunda side. The man who had crossed attached his horse to the four on the cart and was ridden by the man as pilot. While they were crossing strong flows of water seem to have suddenly come down. There swept away the leading horse and its rider, but both managed to reach the Kapunda side. The cart and its four horses were swept downstream. The driver and three passengers, Messrs George Pyke of the Hamilton Hotel, Mr Charles Ware of Kooringa and Mr Joseph Genders of Kooringa managed to save their lives, but William Newman, Billy the Pieman and two passenger were drowned. One of the latter was Dr Hamer, late of Kapunda, but the other name we have not ascertained. The four horses, worth £100 were also drowned. Up to yesterday the bodies had not been recovered. The Burra Mail arrived in town between 6 and 7 last evening. The Government is bound, we believe, to extend the utmost leniency to mail contractors in respect to over-time at the present season. In a country where roads are in a miserable condition and there are virtually no bridges infraction of the regulated time must often be beyond the power of the contractor to prevent.</p>

<p>Protector of Aborigines’ Report</p>
<p>[There is a lengthy report by M. Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines and a letter from E.B. Scott, Protector of Aborigines to the Colonial Secretary. Perhaps the most interesting comment with reference to the Burra District in its broadest sense is:</p>
<p>‘The squatters on the Murray can also bear witness to the great and important service the natives have rendered them during the late scarcity of labour; and on several occasions, natives have been left sole charge of the squatters’ property; and it is gratifying to state, that in no instance has the confidence placed in them been taken advantage of.’]</p>

<p>Alleged Gold Discoveries at the Broughton</p>
<p>Burra correspondents reported in a letter of 24 June that two or three men had returned from the Broughton with about three ounces of gold. This has induced others to leave Burra for further exploration. We cannot verify this claim any further.</p>

<p>A meeting of the principal storekeepers was held recently to consider the propriety of closing their stores earlier than they had been accustomed to. It was resolved that for the winter months they would close at 7 p.m. There being no town clock or other means of ascertaining the time, it was decided that a blunderbuss should be fired at the proper hour and this has been done regularly of late.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines. The Directors have returned from their monthly visit last Sunday, having been detained some time on their journey south by the swollen state of the River Light. Rainfall in the north seems to have been much heavier than in Adelaide. The Mine was found to be very dry and about the same number of pitches was let as on the last occasion. The 200 horsepower engine is nearly ready for action, and it is supposed it will be set to work on the next monthly visit of the Directors.</p>

<p>Proposed Copper Works</p>
<p>A petition from Residents of Port Adelaide is printed that asks the Legislative Council to pass an Act permitting the Patent Copper Company to erect at Port Adelaide buildings for the smelting of copper and other ores, and for the manufacturing of metals by rolling and other processes. They see that it would benefit the port by increasing trade and inducing ships to come in for coppering and other repairs. They say that the experience of Swansea and other towns in the UK shows that such works are not in any degree injurious to health and this is borne out by the works of the same company at Kooringa.</p>

<p>The ‘Schneider’ Engine at the Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Thursday 16 September was appointed for setting in motion the largest steam engine yet employed in the colony.</p>
<p>The engine-house is a most substantial building, the engine room being 25 ft long by 18 ft 4 inches wide. The engine was manufactured at the works of the celebrated Perran Foundry Company in Cornwall and is a beam low-pressure pumping engine of 250 horsepower. The inside diameter of the cylinder is 80 inches, the stroke in the cylinder is 11 ft and in the shaft is 10 ft; the number of strokes per minute is 9 and each raises 136 imperial gallons, or 1,224 gallons per minute. The diameter of the pipe through which the water is discharged is 20 inches. The size of the lift is 20 inches. The steam power is calculated at 15 lb per square inch in the cylinder. The engine draws perpendicularly with the main beam over the cylinder, the length of the beam, from the centre of the main gudgeon to the centre of the inside pin, being 17 feet and from the centre of the inside pin to the centre of the outside pin is 15 ft 6 inches. The depth of beam is 6 ft. The pump is 19 inches in diameter. This information was supplied by John Congdon, the principal engineer.</p>
<p>Before the engine was started the Directors gathered outside the engine-house and Mr Henry Ayers, the Secretary, christened the engine the ‘Schneider’, in honour of the principal representative of the Patent Copper Smelting Company, throwing a bottle of champagne at the beam, an example which was followed by the Directors. Mr Ewbank, one of the Managers of the Patent Copper Company thanked the Directors for the honour they had done Mr Schneider in giving his name to the engine. The company, having gone through the engine-house retired to the residence of Captain Roach for lunch.</p>
<p>At 7 p.m. there was a grand dinner given by the Directors for the captains of the Mine, the engineers and a large number of the inhabitants of Kooringa, at Mr Barker’s Burra Hotel.</p>
<p>The chair was taken by Mr Paxton, with William Allen on his right and E.B. Gleeson on his left. The Vice-Chair was taken by Henry Ayers, supported on his right by F.J. Beck and on his left by Mr Ewbank.</p>
<p>The Chairman proposed toasts to the Queen, the Royal Family and the Governor, after which Mr Gleeson sang a son. Henry Ayers then proposed The Burra Burra Mine. In doing so he acknowledged the present difficulties created by the lack of labour, but said the Mine was in most flourishing condition and he hope in the course of six months to see shiny days again.</p>
<p>C. Ware sang I’m afloat.</p>
<p>Mr Paxton then proposed Captain Roach and his officers, after which there was a song by Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>Captain Roach responded and praised especially the work of Principal Engineer Mr John Congdon.</p>
<p>There was then a song by Henry Ayers, who then proposed the Patent Copper Company and after a song by Mr Samson, Mr Ewbank responded. Mr Williams proposed the Directors and Captain Allen. A song by Mr Gleeson was followed by Captain Allen’s response. Mr Gleeson proposed Henry Ayers. This was followed by another song from Mr Samson, after which Mr Ayers responded. Mr Gleeson then proposed Lady Young and the Ladies of South Australia. Mr Thomas sang and Mr Ewbank returned thanks. Captain Roach proposed William Paxton, who returned thanks. Several other toasts were proposed and responded to, including to Rev. Pollitt and Dr Chambers. The Chairman and Directors withdrew at about 11 p.m., but the remainder of the party enjoyed themselves until the approach of dawn.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association half-yearly report</p>
<p>The position of the company’s affairs underwent no remarkable change in the early part of the half-year just ended, but towards its close the approach of spring and the continued attractiveness of the goldfields again tempted many men to abandon their work and so denuded the mine of labour as to render it impossible to carry on the usual mining operations without incurring serious loss. The Directors consulted Mine Captains and others and determined to suspend work below the water level and allow water to rise until a sufficiency of labour can be procured. Having first taken every practicable means to secure the safety of the Mine, the pumping engines were stopped on 1 October. The water has now risen to within 24 fathoms of the surface without any accident occurring. The powerful pumping engine at Schneider’s Shaft will speedily remove water from the Mine as soon as the arrival of a supply of labour will justify it. In the meantime the remaining men will be employed working pitches in the dry and shallow levels. In the last six months production of ore has been 2,363 tons, estimated to yield an average of 24%, equivalent to 567 tons of copper. The works of the Patent Copper Company have been in active operation and the copper return shows the receipt from them of 1,203 tons of copper in the past half-year. The ore in stock for both companies is sufficient to employ the furnaces for 12 months. No interruption to the smelting works is anticipated. The recent rise in the copper price while the company has large shipments afloat, combined with stock on hand, will greatly increase profits and partly compensate shareholders for the lack of labour.</p>
<p>Total profit for the last six months is £55,432-10-0, which added to profits of £61,307-14-7 derived from the preceding half year, gives a general gain of £116,740-4-10 in the year to 31 March 1851, of which £85,948-7-2 is as yet undivided. At present there is a sum of £86,255 applicable to future dividends.</p>
<p>Since the AGM in April the Directors have paid two dividends of 100% and it is their intention, should no unforseen circumstances occur, to pay similar dividends in December and March next. The number of men and boys employed on 30 September 1852 was 157 and since then has fallen to about 100.</p>

The subscription library has reopened with a large addition of new books. The Oddfellows have announced the reopening of the Burra Burra Lodge. The Patent Copper Co. has resumed its works and it is expected that the large engine will soon resume its operation at the Mine.

<p>In 1852 17 vessels of an aggregate 10,033 tons arrived at Port Wakefield and they brought in 6,606 tons of freight. 19 vessels left with an aggregate tonnage of 11,147 tons, taking away 7,687 tons of copper ore. The inward freight comprised 3,096 tons of coals, 1,960 tons of patent fuel and 550 tons of copper ore (to fill up). These figures of course do not include the copper ore and refined copper brought down to Port Adelaide by the Patent Copper Company’s barges and small craft. It is pleasing to see that despite the effects of the gold diggings the PCC has maintained a good amount of activity, which we trust, will be far exceeded by the results of the year just commenced.</p>

<p>The advertisement by the SA Mining Association in today’s paper cannot but be gratifying to those who have an interest in the progress of SA. Their intention is to resume operations at their deeper levels, which were suspended when the attractions of gold in Victoria caused an exodus of the mining population from Kooringa last year. They might had gone further in inducing the return of miners, but their virtual assurance of 40/- per week will doubtless attract hundreds of steady miners who will see the wisdom to prefer cheap and abundant food and sure gains to the uncertainties, discomforts, separations, hardships and dangers of gold-seeking.</p>

<p>Bench of Magistrates, Adelaide 21 March</p>
<p>Mr Parker applied on behalf of Mr Robert Martin for a licence that had been refused by the Bench the previous week. He said:</p>
<p>When Port Wakefield was declared a legal port of the colony three years ago the Government decided that a public house would be a great convenience.</p>
<p>Mr Martin’s landlord was then given permission to erect a building on Crown land on provision it be removed when town allotments were sold.</p>
<p>As a result a wooden building had been erected and when the town allotments were sold the gentleman referred to bought one and moved the building to the new site.</p>
<p>Mr Martin had taken the building on lease and had spent £750 erecting the present house.</p>
<p>Mr Martin’s character was beyond reproach and he had carefully kept the house closed at the proper hours.</p>
<p>The Government was so impressed with the growing importance and trade at the port that they had decided to establish a police station there forthwith.</p>
<p>He was confident the Bench would agree that it was desirable that some accommodation be provided at a place frequented not only by travellers from the country, but by sailors.</p>
<p>If the licence were not granted Mr Martin would be reduced to poverty.</p>
<p>After much discussion the question was deferred till the following Thursday.</p>

<p>The State of SA’s Roads [Editorial]</p>
<p>Everyone who lives outside Adelaide claims their road is the worst in the colony and no other can compete for ruts, bogs and broken bridges. The Central Road Board seems totally unable to remedy the situation. Residents at Gumeracha say they cannot get their produce to market. The North Road beyond Gawler is in a state of nature; nothing what ever has been done to make it a road. The residents complain loudly considering the value of produce sent down from this district and the amount of money spent on roads south of Adelaide. A bridge is most urgently wanted over the Light; and that in time for the transport of the next wool clip. Last year we are assured that no less than six persons were drowned attempting to cross it. Half the price of land sold ought by the Constitution be spent on roads and bridges. At the rate and prices that land is selling a good many roads and bridges should by now be appearing across the colony. The Central Board should not be perpetually able to cry want of funds. If it is not adapted for its object, let it be abolished. If it the best method we can devise then let it be supplied with the necessary funds.</p>

<p>On Monday last a parting dinner was given by Mr Chambers to his Kooringa friends upon his retiring from his extensive business as a mail contractor. Unfortunately his health prevented him from presiding on the occasion. He was ably represented by Mr Parnell. There were 20-30 guests representing the trade, mining, smelting and farming interests of the district. Among those present were Mr Chambers, Captain Roach, Rev. Pollitt, Mr Humphries, Mr Challoner, Mr Sims (who is one of the purchasers of Mr Chambers’ mail plant), Mr Robinson, Dr Hill &amp; Mr Drew. The Chairman gave a speech stressing the determined spirit that had seen Mr Chambers triumph as a mail contractor all over the colony. His perseverance had banished ‘cannot’ and replaced it with ‘it must be done’ and as a result the mail arrived with remarkable regularity. He hoped this worthy example would be taken up by his successors. He had earned the esteem and friendship of all who knew him. He hoped he would long be spared to enjoy the fruits of the fortune he had so hardly and honourably gained. Mr Chambers responded and proposed ‘Success to Messrs Sims and Hayter’. [His successors.]</p>
<p>[BISA suggests he was James (Jemmy) Chambers who was born 26 September 1812 at Enfield, London, UK and died 7 August 1862 at North Adelaide. He was survived by his wife and six children.]</p>

<p>Snow. On the morning of Sunday 5 October snow fell very fast in the district around Burra Burra. The fall lasted from about 7 a.m. to about 8 a.m. The ground was covered to a depth of four inches, with drifts in places to one foot.</p>

<p>Samuel Davenport, Hon. Secretary to the Local Committee for the London Exhibition of 1851 to R. Hallett &amp; Sons. Having sent specimens of copper for the exhibition by the Will Watch, the committee now takes the advice of the Burra Directors and sends a further four packages by the same vessel: Numbers 13 &amp; 14 contain grain, Number 15 is a case of olive oil and Number 16 is a case of soap. There are some other cases ready for shipment by the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>Packages 1 to 12 contain specimens of copper ore and copper from the Burra Mine:</p>
<p>Ores of red oxide of from 60 to 65% of copper</p>
<p>Ores of blue and green carbonates of from 35 to 40%</p>
<p>Ores of red oxide and malachite combined, of from 60 to 70%</p>
<p>Ores of malachite of various percentages, including fibrous malachite</p>
<p>Ores of red oxide and native copper combined, of about 80%.</p>
<p>There are also specimens of native copper and of copper manufactured at the Burra; as well as of the different strata in which the Burra ores are found embedded.</p>

<p>The Anniversary Services were held on Sunday and Monday 27 &amp; 28 November. Sermons were preached by Rev. Walter Tregellas and Rev. R.C. Flockart. The tea meeting in the chapel on Monday was very largely attended. The proceeds of the event were £67-10-4, which will reduce the debt on the mission premises to about £150. Considering the present state of the Burra, this amount contributed shows a very noble and praiseworthy effort.</p>

<p>W.B .Lucas writes commenting on a claim by Mr Hewitt at the Central Road Board that nothing had been done to the southern roads:</p>
<p>When Mr Hewitt went to McLaren Vale 12 years ago he may remember two parties were engaged in laying out the road south of Willunga and in building bridges. What has ever been done for the North Road beyond Gawler? I am not aware that at present a single main line to the north of Gawler Town is properly laid out or defined. I am afraid if it is not attended to accidents at the Light will be still more numerous. Bullock dray tracks are our only roads north of Gawler.</p>

<p>Railroads. This article says that railways are needed to open up large tracts of land for farming. In America statistical figures show that railways can transport grain at one tenth the cost of road transport. The figures in Australia might be rather different, but it is safe to say the difference between road and rail would certainly be very great.</p>

<p>1853 in Retrospect</p>
<p>From a commercial and social point of view 1853 provided more cause for congratulation that any previous one. There can be no doubts of the ultimate prosperity of the colony. The drainage of labour and capital at the start of 1852, to the goldfields in the neighbouring colony led to serious fears of a monetary crisis. Business stagnated, property values depreciated and houses and shops were shut up. Able-bodied labourers, mechanics, artisans, tradesmen and merchants were leaving every day in such numbers as to threaten the depopulation of the colony. Banks were being reduced to insolvency. Steps were taken which proved entirely successful and through the skilful management of the Government the impending crisis was averted. Prosperity and social order now reign. The Bill to establish a Parliament in SA has been sent to England last November and is expected to return with the Imperial sanction within six months from now. Several other measures of importance have passed the Legislative Council: the Postal Bill, the Bill for the more effectual Administration of Justice in the Supreme Court and several others. The Murray has been opened for navigation and already considerable wool trade have flowed from NSW and Victoria to SA, with provisions flowing the other way. 50 steam vessels have arrived at Port Adelaide during the year and upwards of 300 sailing vessels. The transmission of information from England has been reduced to about 68 days. This is expected to be about halved when large steam vessels now being built, come into service.</p>
<p>During 1853 about 20,000 arrived in the colony and about 11,000 departed. The excess of arrivals over departures has grown in the second half of the year. 218,398 acres of Crown land were sold in the year for £298,557. The Overland Gold Escort brought in 99,113 oz of gold, valued at £390,000. The escort has now been discontinued, but arrangements have been made with the Victorian Government for the transmission of gold from Victoria by sea.</p>
<p>Another sign of progress has been the passage of the District Councils Act and 20 District Councils have been called into operation during the year. There is a large amount of wealth lying in the coffers of the Banks this can be used for private and public works when labour can be procured. The deposits represent about £20 per head of the entire population, a state of affairs scarcely to be found in the world beyond the limits of the Australian colonies.</p>

<p>Fire. A bushfire commenced on Saturday near the River Light and ran over the ranges for about eight miles towards Saddleworth. It rages throughout Sunday and on Monday night ran rapidly through some three acres of standing wheat in Mr Burston’s paddock as well as damaging fences, stockyards and piggeries. The house of wood and roofed with shingles was saved with difficulty. The fire reached Mr Coghill’s paddock, but was stopped there without inflicting damage. The fire was extinguished before daylight on Tuesday. A little before noon though, thatch on Mr John Freestone’s hut caught alight and the building could not be saved. This time the flames spread to grass in all directions, but with the help of neighbours was again put our and Mr Coghill’s haystack was saved.</p>

<p>Gold Discovery. Several miners from Burra have gone to test the newly reported discovery of gold at Black Springs*. A gentleman in the neighbourhood reports seeing them washing stuff, but there are no verifiable report of gold. [Note that Ian Auhl has added the note that the report was of gold at Black Rock not Black Springs.]</p>

<p>Railways [Editorial]</p>
<p>[The writer begins with a discussion about whether it is appropriate for the central Road Board to be supervising the construction of the railway to Gawler. This choice for the first railway into rural area is obvious because it is nearly flat, gives access to rich agricultural country and is on the way to the copper mines of Burra Burra, an extension to which is of such obvious utility when money and labour become available. The opening up of navigation on the Murray provides another reason for the railway to Gawler and for its eventual extension perhaps to Moorundee.]</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>The usual survey took place on Thursday last, at which 14 pitches and bargains were let to about 50 miners. The total number employed is now about 160. This was decided the best survey since the stoppage of the great pumping engine in 1852. The lack of success at the gold diggings and the prospect of high wages at the Burra Burra Mines by tributers has induced miners to return to their old employment. The ore produced during the last ‘take’ of eight weeks was 600 tons. This is a very satisfactory result from the shallow levels of the property.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>Some men of experience thought that this mine would have a brilliant, but short career; others predicted that after seven years discoveries would have been made of yet richer and more durable sources of wealth. This group seem to have been borne out by the recent announcement of the discovery of a magnificently large and rich lode of red oxide in new ground at a depth of only 12 fathoms. When the most recent news was despatched the extent of the lode was still not known, but the impression was that a thousand men might profitably be employed, even without the resumption of mining at the lower levels, which has been suspended due to the rush of labour to the goldfields.</p>
<p>30 March 1854, page 2</p>
<p>Railways in SA</p>
<p>The Adelaide Times has made some calculations to show that railways in this colony would necessarily be an unremunerative investment. We insert their calculations as a matter of fairness, as we have been an advocate of railways.</p>
<p>Let us assume the Register’s assertion (though we believe it wrong) that a railway can be constructed for £5,000 per mile and that a single line of track will serve. On this basis a line to Kooringa will cost £500,000. Let us grant the impossible, that half the colony’s exports come down the line and that the return traffic is of equal volume. What would the profit be? Assuming exports of 25,000 tons. Half would then be 12,500 tons and with back traffic the line would carry 25,000 tons. The present rate of cartage is £4 per ton up and £2-10-0 per ton for ore down. Even allowing for the cartage on wool to be higher, we would still be high in our estimates to take it at £4 per ton both ways. The gross income would be £100,000. But good would not travel all the way, much traffic being received at intermediate points. A fair average would be half or £50,000. In England the cost of working a line at best is reckoned at 60%, which leaves as profit 40% or £20,000. This would yield 4% on the outlay and we know that all these figures are ridiculously against ourselves. We know that a single line could not do this work, that a Burra line would not bring half our exports, that Port Wakefield would be the export port for copper, much of the copper ore and much of the wool, etc.</p>
<p>We respond by saying</p>
<p>At present half the exports do not come down the North Road, but if there were a railway an amount equivalent to half the present exports would come by that route, so that the 25,000 tons p.a. estimated is not extravagant.</p>
<p>The land alongside the railway would be cultivated. Victoria can consume more than four times the flour we have to spare and also much hay, bran, oats, barley and potatoes.</p>
<p>At the very least assuming land for two miles either side is cultivated 64,000 tons of grain could be generated and if half this figure is carried the whole distance it gives 32,000 tons.</p>
<p>Rest assured the copper would not be transported to Port Wakefield in so primitive a manner as on the backs of mules if a railway could get it to Port Adelaide and wool now sent by dray would certainly come by rail.</p>
<p>The cost of operation a railway in England is not 60%, but rather 48% according to the London Times.</p>

<p>Presentation to Dr W.P. Hill</p>
<p>At the Burra Burra Hotel on 27 March a group of gentlemen, farmers and tradesmen gathered to make a presentation to Dr Hill as a mark of their esteem and friendship. The presentation was a silver cup fashioned by Mr Firnhaber of North Adelaide. There is a horse elaborately chased on one side and an inscription surrounded by a wreath. About twenty persons gathered for a supper provided by Mr &amp; Mrs Barker. The inscription on the cup is: ‘Presented to W.P. Hill, Esq., as a testimony of esteem, and for his exertions in support of the Burra Burra Races, March 1854.’ Dr Hill thanked them for their kindness, but said his health did not allow him to speak much at present.</p>
<p>Presentation to T.W. Powell</p>
<p>In the week prior to Dr Hill’s presentation, Rev. Pollitt, &amp; Messrs Stanbury, Mackay, Bruce &amp; Drew waited upon Mr T.W. Powell, the postmaster at Kooringa and in consideration of the general, indeed almost universal satisfaction for the manner in which he had fulfilled his duties as postmaster, they presented him with a purse of 30 guineas. They only wished that the sum had been larger. There were 40 signatures of subscribers attached to the address.</p>

<p>Notice. The SA Mining Association gives notice of its AGM at the Company’s Office in Rundle Street 19 April at 11 a.m. The purpose of the meeting is to receive the Directors’ Report, the Secretary’s Report and to examine the Auditor’s Report and accounts. Also to elect eight Directors in place of Messrs Sanders, Hall &amp; Allen, disqualified, and Messrs Peacock, Paxton, Waterhouse, Kingston &amp; Beck, who retire and to elect an auditor in place of Mr GeorgeTinline who has resigned.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. [Editorial]</p>
<p>The SA Mining Association has released its Ninth Annual Report.</p>
<p>The capital stock as originally subscribed was £12,320 and this has been augmented by the sum of £123,200, which has been derived entirely from clear and available profits after the distribution of 21 dividends. A sum of £12,614-12-3 is available for a dividend of 100% and will become payable on 3 June next. Mineral or metallic products available for further realisation will give immediate assurance of future dividends.</p>
<p>The prospective advantages are cheering not only for shareholders, but for all colonists, as all have benefited from the prosperity of the Burra. All may hope for a return of previous prosperity, inasmuch as new discoveries are accompanied by the likelihood of the return of labour from the goldfields. Captain Roach has expressed his hope that the great engine will be at work and the water pumped from the Mine before his next report. This would enable him to report on splendid lodes in the deeper levels as well as recent red oxide deposits recently discovered at the depth of a few fathoms. The election of Directors for the ensuing year produced Messrs William Allen, Thomas Waterhouse, Nicholas Peter LeBair, George Strickland Kingston, George Hall, William Peacock, William Paxton and Frederick John Beck. Auditor George Tinline has left SA and his place has been taken by John Brown.</p>
<p>Including officers there are 191 persons employed; a force so inadequate that the Directors have declared that the want of labour is most acutely felt.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. J.W. Macdonald Special Magistrate held an inquest on 1 September into the death of Mr T.B. Marchant. The deceased’s body was found that morning 400 yards from Aberdeen on the Booborowie Road. He had waited for the evening mail and then left at 8.30 p.m. in good health. It appears that at a sharp turn of the road there was a pile of white earth from a shaft and his horse must have shied at it. It left the road for about 100 yards and then apparently stopped suddenly, throwing the rider over its head. The deceased received a fracture at the base of the skull resulting in death. The verdict was ‘accidental death’. Mr Marchant was universally beloved and respected and shopkeepers in Kooringa intend to keep their shops closed during the interment. Papers found on the body show that among his other labours of love, he was collecting for the widows and orphans of those engaged in the present war*, in which endeavour he had been very successful. He was a most upright and generous man.</p>
<p>[* The ‘present war’ was the Crimean War.]</p>
<p>[Thomas Balne Marchant died 31 August 1854 aged 28. BISA entry says he was born 4 August 1826 Freshford, Somerset, UK, had arrived in SA in 1840 on the Fairlie and was unmarried.]</p>

<p>The subscribers to the fund for enclosing the Kooringa Cemetery met on Friday last in the Wesleyan Schoolroom with Mr Challoner in the chair. When the various lists were handed in, it was found that £220 had been either subscribed or promised to meet an anticipated outlay of £300. A committee of management was elected. They are to submit the by-laws to a public meeting on the last Friday in November.</p>

<p>Copper &amp; Lead Production in SA</p>
<p>Since our last summary the Directors of the Burra Burra Mines have paid the twenty third dividend of 100%. By the ships William Prowse, Thetis and Confiance a considerable supply of miners has arrived and proceeded to the mines. Should others follow as expected, we may soon see the mines in full work again. Captain Pascoe has supplied the following approximate return of copper and lead ores raised in SA since the first discovery of metalliferous ores.</p>
<p>The value of 115, 520 tons of copper ore at £15 per ton would be £1,732,800 and of 2,429 tons of silver-lead ore at £12 per ton would be £29,148.</p>
<p>Most of these ores were raised between 1844 and 1850. We are assured that reckoning every man, woman and child employed in raising and preparing ores, even before the goldfields were discovered, never exceeded 3,000 souls. This means the average returns of their productive industry in those years averaged nearly £600 per head.</p>
<p>Nothing approaching exhaustion has resulted from such productiveness. The Burra Burra is still as rich in its quality of ores and has great productive capabilities. Kapunda’s ores have averaged 21% and before 1848 eight lodes had been discovered and were all producing. It is difficult to form an estimate of its future productiveness.</p>
<p>19 October 1854, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association held its half-yearly meeting at the office in Adelaide yesterday. The Directors report a gratifying increase in activity. For some time they have been making preparations to resume deep level operations in the hope that sufficient miners would present themselves. The total number of persons employed at present is 279 including 12 officers. This is a considerable increase since last March, but remains very low. We do not doubt that the numbers will increase greatly in the next few months from the returning miners from the partially depleted goldfields of Victoria and from arrangement with the Emigration Commissioners who have relaxed some regulations in favour of copper-miners coming to SA.</p>
<p>Although work in the last six months has been confined to the shallow levels, the ore raised to 30 September amounted to 2,733 tons, containing about 18% copper; equal to 500 tons of metallic copper.</p>
<p>The profit and loss statement for the six months ending 30 September 1853 shows a nett profit of £11,981-4-8. The quantity of ore raised in that time was 1,781 tons, which sold for £20,519-13-5 or an average £11-10-5 per ton. The cost of production was £8,538-8-9 or £4-5-11 per ton; leaving a surplus of £6-14-6 per ton.</p>
<p>The quantity of ore on hand at the surface is 2,126 tons and the quantity of metallic copper yet to be realised is 328 tons. There is a balance of £27,753-11-7 available for dividends. Some time must elapse before the proceeds of copper and copper ore can be matured, so it is not proposed to pay another dividend before 3 March 1855. After that time, with the return of labour, there is every expectation that quarterly dividends can be resumed.</p>

<p>[An announcement outlines the rules for gaining up to £5,000 for finding a payable gold field in SA. The reward was payable out of a fund that depended on income from gold licences. It was only payable if £600 or more was received from licences in a month. The excess to a maximum of £5,000 was payable to the discoverer. It was an offer limited to 1854 and 1855.]</p>

<p>Education Report [Editorial]</p>
<p>The account considers Education in SA to be generally satisfactory. There has been a light increase in schools and in numbers of scholars. Teachers are becoming more competent. There are now 121 schools; an increase of 18 on 1853. 32 are in the city, 25 are suburban and 64 are in the country. Average attendance has been 5,648 of which 3,136 were boys and 2,512 were girls. This is an increase of 808 on the same quarter of 1853. The average attendance at a school is 46 and the excess of boys over girls is nearly 25%. In September 1,192 were aged &lt;6, 1098 were between 11 &amp; 14 and 126 were 15 and over.</p>
<p>[Further statistical details are printed, including costs.]</p>
<p>Licences have been withdrawn from some poorly performing schools in the city and suburbs, but they have to be tolerated in the country for the absence of anything better and because in those places well qualified teachers would find insufficient scope for their talents and inadequate remuneration.</p>
<p>In populous districts the greatest impediment to improved education is the want of rooms.</p>
<p>[There is quite a discussion on incompetent teachers.]</p>
<p>The Inspector visited 30 town [city] schools and 24 suburban ones and 24 country schools. He reported the introduction of the principle of pupil-teachers (in two schools) with a fair degree of success. This is to be encouraged because of the lack of efficient teachers. This can only be addressed by importing them or training them.</p>
<p>The lack of school books has been addressed and a supply should arrive soon on the Albemarie.</p>
<p>The attendance of students has, as usual, been affected by their absence to take part in various kinds of labour and in a few schools by the presence of the epidemic, which has spread through the populated districts.</p>
<p>There is also a problem of the lack of teaching materials, long ordered from England, but not yet arrived. The lack of school furniture is another problem.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>Numerous persons have been applying for work at the mine and with the prospect of sufficient labour, the Directors have decided upon setting the large engine in motion and getting the water into fork. It is now two years and two months since pumping ceased. The water then rose in about six weeks until it reached the 22 fathom level; the level it was originally. Instructions were sent to Captain Roach last Wednesday to resume operations. The Directors start for the Mine this morning and had hoped to see the engine in operation, but this is unlikely. Nevertheless there is not likely to be much delay. After the water is lowered there will be a careful inspection of each level to ensure safety and as the water can expect to be lowered in about six weeks, we may expect operation at depth to begin an about eight weeks. This information is of great importance to miners both here and in Victoria and although not official, can be taken as correct. The Directors are expected back on Friday, when we can expect an announcement on the re-opening of the deep levels.</p>

<p>The Register Newspaper</p>
<p>The South Australian Register was originated in London, where its first number was published 18 June 1836, previous to the departure of the first Governor from England. The second number was published in Adelaide 3 June 1837. In its early days it was a semi-official journal. The Government Gazette was incorporated with the independent portion of the paper; the whole being issued under two distinct titles and the non-official portion being acknowledged as entirely free from Government influence or control. On 15 June 1839 the Gazette was published in a separate sheet and the Register was wholly devoted to the interests of the community. The publisher of the Register continued, however, to print the Gazette as a distinct and official organ. In the early days producing a paper was fraught with difficulties. There were acute mechanical and financial difficulties as well as a severe shortage of writers. Printers were even scarcer. It was initially impossible to publish the paper at regular intervals, but from 10 June 1838 it was published once a week in six pages of demy. In early 1840 it was enlarged to 8 pages and on 29 August 1840 it became a broadsheet. In February 1843 it became a bi-weekly; and on 1 January 1850 it was first published as a daily paper. Although passing through the hands of several proprietors, the Register has always advocated the same basic principles. It has always stood for civil and religious freedom; always denounced abuses and supported measures of public utility and approached its relationship with Government with impartiality. On the occasion of our removal to the premises now occupied we made reference to our having the first steam printing press in the colony. Our expectations of its capabilities were fully answered. Now even more machinery is on its way hither, including a magnificent double-cylinder printing machine.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Last Thursday at 5 a.m. the great 250 h.p. engine commenced pumping water from the deep levels of the Mine and by 6 p.m. the water level had fallen 15 ft. It is not likely that this rate of reduction will continue, as there are large accumulations of water in the lower levels. We may, however, hope that the water will be in fork in the next month to six weeks. We hope to give more news of progress in three days. There are now upwards of 300 men at the Mine, with more arriving daily. The great Mine is set to again become the standby of the colony. It is expected to be in full production by about May.</p>

<p>SA Mining</p>
<p>We noted in our last summary that work has recommenced at the Burra Burra Mine. The operations have been steadily continued without any problems. The number of hands employed is about 450. The quality of ore being raised is about 23% copper, though much richer ore exists in the 40 fathom level.</p>
<p>The Kapunda Mine is also in full work.</p>
<p>During the last session of the Legislative Council legislation was passed to facilitate the winding up of Joint Stock Companies. Several mining companies are taking advantage of this, taking steps to sell their land and dissolving the companies. Among them are: North Kapunda Mining Co., the Greenock Creek Mining Co., the Breadalbane Mining Co., The Glenalbyn Mining Co., the Prince Albert Mining Co., the Adelaide Mining Co., the North Rhine Mining Co., the North Rhine Mining Association and the Outside Kapunda Land Company.</p>
<p>These sales will throw a considerable amount of land onto the market, more or less valuable for its mineral deposits.</p>
<p>The Echunga gold diggings are still being worked by a few diggers, who find their labour pays. No second goldfield has been discovered.</p>

<p>Kooringa Flood</p>
<p>On 22 &amp; 23 March we had exceedingly heavy rains accompanied by a great deal of thunder and lightning. On Friday (23rd) the main street was so flooded that the waters stretched from one side to the other. A boy was swept away by floodwaters for about 100 yards and was lucky to escape alive. A man was also swept away trying to cross the street in front of Truro House and, losing his footing was swept about 50 yards nearly to the police station. At time he was partially able to regain his footing and the next moment completely under water. At last he was swept near the edge of the stream and two men helped him to escape.</p>

<p>SA Mining</p>
<p>Since our last summary the works at the Burra Burra Mine have been resumed with vigour. The great engine at the Mine reduced the level of water with great rapidity and it is now ‘in fork’. The levels have been examined and the Mine is pronounced fully secure. The Company is employing as many men as it can obtain and its prosperity is at present limited only by the scanty and costly supply of labour.</p>
<p>The SA Government has offered a reward of £2,000 for the discovery of a good coal field and of £1,000 for the discovery of an anthracite or lignite coal field.</p>
<p>The inducements offered for the discovery of gold have been unavailing. Echunga has been the only field to date and there the number of diggers has increased of late. No great gains have been reported from there, but persevering hands find that on the whole it is more remunerative than the average wages of labour.</p>

<p>Easter at Kooringa</p>
<p>Among the Easter amusements at Kooringa on Monday was a race after a little porker with a greasy tail. About 20 started in the chase, but within five minutes 200 must have been following the poor little animal. At one stage another small pig distracted about half the hunters, who were most disappointed to find they had run down the wrong animal. After about 15 minutes the one with the oiled tail was captured; being completely exhausted.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]</p>
<p>The tenth annual report of the SA Mining Association is of a more promising character than we have been able to print for some time. Slowly, but surely the Mine is recovering from the effect of the exodus of the male population to the gold diggings in Victoria. The water, which had been allowed to rise in the Mine, is now ‘forked’ and men are once more busy raising the ore. The profit of their labour has been somewhat diminished by the need to remove mud that had collected in the levels while the mine was flooded. But now we hope to hear of ore being raised without interruption. As the Victorian goldfields are not nearly as tempting as they were in 1852, we need not fear a second stoppage of the works. During the quarter just ended 4,128 tons of ore were raised, yielding 18% copper. In the corresponding period last year the amount was 2,267 tons; the cost of which was about half the money obtained for it and from the resulting profit the 24th dividend was paid on 3 April. The profit and loss statement shows a balance in favour of the Company of £27,420-9-1. The Directors do not promise a dividend in the next half year, due to the difficulties of getting produce to market in the winter time.</p>

<p>Rumoured Gold Discovery Near Burra Burra</p>
<p>Information reached us yesterday that gold had been discovered within about two miles of Kooringa and that it had created considerable excitement. We cannot confirm the rumour.</p>

<p>‘An Inhabitant’ writes from Kooringa 19 April 1855 re Police at the Burra.</p>
<p>Now that the town is beginning to flourish again it is time to think of augmenting the police here to protect life and property. At present there are but four mounted police to serve a population of about 2,000. I believe we need another four foot-police, not only to protect property, but to control furious riding, which is common and endangers lives. Controlling the straying pigs, goats etc. is also required. The mounted men seem very active, but insufficient for the demands of the place.</p>

<p>Kooringa Farewell to Mr William Paxton</p>
<p>On Wednesday 2 May about 50 gentlemen attended a dinner at the Burr Hotel to honour Mr Paxton who is about to return to England. Dr Mayne took the chair at 7 o’clock. Among those present were: Mr Jaffrey (a Director), Captain Roach, G.S. Kingston MLC (a Director), John Morphett MLC (a Director), Henry Ayers, John Newman, Henry Noltenius, G.H. Fox and several other gentlemen from Adelaide and residents of Kooringa.</p>
<p>Among those present the report also names Mr C. Ware, Mr Barker, Mr Challoner, Mr Robert Cowper, Mr Powell, Captain Matthews, Mr Pearce, Mr Edlin, Inspector Gardner and Mr George Bennett.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner proposed the health of Mr Paxton. He said Mr Paxton was well known as a large holder of property in Kooringa, who had done much for the interests of the township and had always exerted himself to encourage the sports of the colony. He was for a considerable time the owner of the racehorse Highflyer. He wished him and his family a happy and pleasant voyage to England.</p>
<p>Mr Paxton in replying said he was proud to have been associated with the Mine since its start. He had seen the first pick struck and had since noted its steady progression. Had it not been for the Burra SA would not be in the position it was today. He did not take credit to himself for what he had done for the Burra, as he had done it to benefit himself as well as others.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mines and Smelting Works</p>
<p>The great Burra Burra Mines, which long ago proved the salvation of the colony, were deserted by the miners for the more glittering prospects of goldfields and it was not thought worthwhile even to keep the engine at work. The water was consequently allowed to rise and the 85 horse-power Roach’s engine, named for the captain of the Mine was taken down. Its size had been found insufficient, the country around not being drained, as in Cornwall, by numerous other engines. It was packed away; a new one of 250 horse-power, named after Mr Schneider of the Smelting Company, having previously been erected upon a new shaft named after him. Lately as the attraction of the goldfields diminished, it was decided to recommence working the Mine as labour returned. In a short time Schneider’s engine had the water in fork to the 40 fathom level.</p>
<p>In Kooringa the deserted houses, or at least as many of them as destructive hands have left inhabitable, are now re-occupied. It is now hard foe returning or new miners to find accommodation. The appearance of the town is cheerful and businesslike. Trade is flourishing.</p>
<p>On approaching the Mine, Schneider’s Engine-House dominates, with its giant beam appearing at the top of the building. It works at seven strokes per minute, with each stroke lifting 136 gallons of water. Before the water was in fork it was working at almost twice that speed. The shears above Roach’s Shaft remain, though the engine has been removed. The figure of the miner with his pick and dag still occupies his old place. The shaft has been repaired and is used for raising ore.</p>
<p>Another engine, known as No. 2 and of 40 horse-power is employed in crushing ore, with two rollers half an inch apart, capable of turning out 50 tons a day. At present it is producing 35-40 tons per day. It is also raising water from the deep levels of Ayer’s No. 2 shaft.</p>
<p>Near the engine houses are the Mine Offices and residences of the principal officers. Captain Roach, who is the head of the entire establishment, has a substantial stone house, containing four rooms, adjoining which are the offices. These comprise the Boardroom, captain’s consulting and changing rooms, pay office, accountant’s office, assay office and draughtsman’s room. Next to them is the house of Mr Elphick the Assay-Master, in front of which and of Captain Roach’s are carefully tended gardens. There are also residences for Dr Mayne, the Mine Surgeon, the second, third and fourth captains (Messrs Bryant, Goldsworthy &amp; Mitchell), for Mr Congdon, the Chief Engineer and for some other officers.</p>
<p>Near this little village is a pool of about an acre in extent, in course of excavation, which will form a reservoir for the water thrown up by the engines. It is probable that this will be beautified by planting trees around it and there are rumours of stocking it with fish and setting a pleasure craft on its surface.</p>
<p>The smiths’ shop, miners’ tool shed and shoeing shed should be noted. There are six forges, five of which are now at work employing five men and four lads. The material house or general shop is where all articles are kept that are likely to be needed at the Mine. Not far away are the offices of the Night Captain.</p>
<p>The numerous jigging machines and other contrivances for ore washing are kept under secure sheds.</p>
<p>The stables are substantial buildings with stalls for about 50 horses and the sheds about the yards will accommodate 200 more. At present 85 horses are working in the Mine.</p>
<p>Another yard some 203 acres in size is walled in stone and contains the timber used in the Mine and copper received from the Smelting Works.</p>
<p>On top of the surrounding hills may be seen the flues of the different engines and also the magazine, containing usually five or six tons of powder.</p>
<p>Schneider’s Engine is a beautiful piece of workmanship, made by the Perran Co., large Cornish manufacturers. It has an 80 inch cylinder with a 12 foot stroke. The steam is supplied by three boilers. The fuel used is wood and coal together. The engineer, Mr Congdon, was formerly engaged in the South Carron Mine near Liskeard and came to Australia as the Chief Engineer of the steamer Omega. In the week ending 10 March the engine performed 71,196 strokes and raised 9,682,656 gallons. The water is conveyed by troughs and cuttings for the convenient washing of the ore and eventually finds its way into the Burra creek, of which it makes a complete rivulet. The water, as it comes from the Mine is perfectly clear and wholesome, but that usually used for drinking is generally drawn from wells about 60 ft deep.</p>
<p>Our correspondent was arrayed in proper dress and accompanied by Captains Henry Roach and Richard Goldsworthy, ventured underground. Both Captains are Cornishmen, the former from Redruth and the latter from Bodmin. They have been at the Mine for 9 and 8 years respectively. Captain Roach went from England to Columbia in 1832 as a miner for the Bolivar Co. He became Captain in 1834 and continued in that position till 1842, when he returned to England. He came to Sain 1846 in the Hooghly and was almost immediately engaged at the Burra Mine.</p>
<p>The party descended by ladder in Waterhouse’s footway for four fathoms and then through various galleries, passing Peacock’s No. 1 &amp; No. 2 shafts and reaching Schneider’s engine shaft at the 20 fathom. There the 20 inch plunger makes the second lift, the lower plunger having raised the water from the 40 fathom. They then descended to the 30 and 40 fathom levels by Peacock’s ladder winzes. In the latter the deeper plunger works.</p>
<p>They then visited the various galleries and shafts on the 40 fathom level, which is kept dry by another level running from Schneider’s to Roach’s and called the deep 40, two fathoms lower.</p>
<p>Ayer’s No. 2 shaft has a level at 50 fathoms containing malachite, but nothing is doing in it at present below the 40 fathom level. The shaft itself is sunk 5 fathoms deeper (the deepest miners have so far gone) and there are now 10 fathoms of water in it, which will be pumped out by the No. 2 engine.</p>
<p>Then they returned to the 30 fathom level by Ayer’s ladder winze. It is at that level and the 40 that the principal work is going on at present. At the 30 there are many galleries as well as Kingston’s, Graham’s and several other shafts. The tributers here seem to be doing well. The 20 fathom may be reached by Graham’s ladder winze, which also conducts to the 12, the 6 and the surface.</p>
<p>[The article them reports on current operations in each shaft.]</p>
<p>The number of hands currently engaged on underground and surface work is about 450.</p>
<p>The effects of allowing the water to rise were greater than many may have imagined.</p>
<p>Most of the 30 and 40 fathom levels were blocked up with soft slush at least breast high. All that had to be removed. The wooden slabs were generally forced inwards, so that the greater part of the mine has had to be fresh timbered. About 20 or 30 men are still engaged in preparing slabs for this purpose.</p>
<p>The average of the ores now being raised does not exceed 20%, though some in the 40 fathom level is far richer.</p>
<p>The company’s property around the Mine has a very desolate and barren appearance. It has lately been entirely denuded of trees by order of the Directors, who finding they could not preserve them from depredation, determined on using them at once.</p>
<p>The present high prices of provisions militate against the successful working of the Mine. The lowest wages upon which the men can live and the high transport costs mean that profits are less than in former times. There are no sulphurets in the Burra Mine, or the ore might be reduced to regulus. The only course that can be pursued with the lower grade ores is to smelt them in the colony. This has been done for some years at the neighbouring smelting works, but the high cost of fuel is a great discouragement.</p>
<p>A walk around the smelting works shows them to be in a lamentable state of inactivity due to the want of labour. Of the nineteen furnaces capable of smelting 80-90 tons of rough copper per week and which have at times turned out 95 tons, only five are presently at work. The rest do not have men to attend them, nor at present are there men to cart the fuel to support them. Only four or five furnaces have been in use, and those for only four months of the year during the past two years. The want of men is somewhat surprising as steady men have been receiving 30/- to 35/- per week. As a result about 6,000 tons of copper ore are lying idle. No wonder, when we find that instead of the 1,000 men whom the Smelting Company at one time employed, there are nor only 200 including carters. Formerly 400 teams were yoked up and the number of bullocks was 3,500. At that time employment could have been found for 600 teams.</p>
<p>The establishment is in every way complete in itself. There is a 35 stall stable, but the beasts of burden now principally used are mules, of which the Smelting Company has at present a stud of 470. These are chiefly worked in shaft and 10 of them are able in eight days to carry three tons of ore or copper to Port Wakefield and to return with a similar quantity of coal. They are able to average three trips per month. 200 mules arrived lately by the Malacca, from South America and all are in perfect working order. The Smelting Co. has 12 wagons weighing 18 cwt each. These were built upon the ground and 50 more with suitable harness have been ordered from England.</p>
<p>The Company has been lucky in holding a large stack of last year’s hay. About 100 of 175 tons remain.</p>
<p>Each furnace consumes from £120 to £130 worth of coal per week. There are at present about 1,200 tons of coal and patent fuel on the ground and the stock is being constantly replenished from Port Wakefield.</p>
<p>The only skilled work is in the maintaining the fires and the drawing off the slag without wasting copper.</p>
<p>Sixteen Chilean labourers have recently arrived, making in all 22. These with a few women and children form a happy-looking little community.</p>
<p>At present from 120 to 130 tons of ore per week are being smelted, yielding an average 23% copper. The principal fluxes used are iron with manganese and lime. The former are found within 10 miles of the works.</p>
<p>The large consumption of fire bricks had induced the Company to make them on the spot and an excellent supply of fire-clay has been found, at a distance of 10-15 miles on the Murray Flats. A 40 horse-power condensing engine has been erected, with two pairs of rollers, for the purpose of crushing the clay and old bricks and there are suitable workshops, kilns etc. for carrying on the work. The same engine crushes the fluxes.</p>
<p>The establishment includes a general store, a weighbridge, smiths,’ wheelwrights,’ and saddlers’ shops etc. As an example of the shortage of labour; for some time only two wheelwrights could be obtained, though there was a need for twenty. The two were earning nearly £1 a day each.</p>
<p>Mr Williams, the Manager, has a commodious residence, with tastefully arranged garden adjoining the Company’s offices. There are several houses for the Company’s agents and at a short distance is springing up a little township called Llwchwr, where allotments have been sold to workers at £5 per acre.</p>
<p>The Smelting Company, known as the English &amp; Australian Smelting Co., began operations in the colony in 1849 and to the end of 1854 had smelted 7,597 tons of fine copper, the average value of which can be taken at £95 per ton. The present price is £120. During the same period it has shipped 21,000 tons of ore and consumed 27,000 tons of coal. In the six months commencing October 1851 the amount of cartage between Burra and Port Wakefield was about 10,000 tons each way. (About 10,300 tons of coal up and 9,600 tons of ore down.) During the season which may now be considered at an end the quantity has been about 3,000 tons each way. The 70 miles of the Port Wakefield Road have been kept in repair at the Smelting Company’s expense, with but a solitary grant of £500 from the Central Road Board. The total traffic which has passed over it during the last five years has been 48,730 tons or an average of more than 9,700 tons per annum.</p>
<p>The Steam Ship Burra Burra</p>
<p>We understand that Messrs Hall &amp; Co., the proprietors of this fine screw-steamer have appointed this day for a trial trip and that the Burra Burra will leave the wharf at 11 a.m. precisely, returning in the afternoon. It is said that numerous invitations have been issued and that the party of excursionists will include many of the principal merchants and leading colonists.</p>

<p>Kooringa Court</p>
<p>Pascual Benito, a muleteer in the services of the Patent Copper Co., was charged by William Edwards with assault.</p>
<p>Edwards was employed at the Smelting Words. On 11 May he had wheeled a barrow-load of coal into the workshop and on the way out Benito had seized him by the throat and uttered something in Spanish and then picked up a sledge-hammer and held it in the defendant’s face. Benito said that Edwards owed him £3 and not being able to demand it in English, took this method of making his demand clear. Edwards denied having £3 of Benito’s. Judgement was deferred.</p>
<p>William Gendall was charged with cutting and stabling Robert Wallis that (Saturday) morning.</p>
<p>Jane Wallis, wife of the complainant, said she and the wife of the prisoner had had some words, followed by some throwing of things at each other. Her husband tried to part them and in doing so had struck the defendant’s wife on the knee. Her husband and the prisoner had commenced quarrelling and challenged each other to a fight. She could not say who started it. Saw no knife in the prisoner’s hand, but saw it on the ground outside the door. A man had picked it up and given it to her. She closed it and put it in her pocket. She identified the knife produced. She did not know her husband had been stabbed until he asked a man to fetch a doctor. He stripped himself and she saw blood run onto the floor. The wound was a deep one. She said both men were sober. Dr T.H. Mayne said the wound on the thigh was a dangerous one. It was a large incised would, about four inches long and one and a half inches deep. Given its position, it could have been more dangerous.</p>
<p>Remanded for one week in the hope the prosecutor might by then be well enough to attend.</p>

<p>Kooringa News</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the Queen’s Birthday, all businesses in Kooringa were closed and everyone seemed to be out of town. In the evening there was a grand fireworks display in Market Square. The principal pieces were really good, but owing to the boisterous weather they were not seen to best advantage. After the fireworks there was a dinner at the Miners’ Arms attended by nearly all the storekeepers and other gentlemen. After the removal of the cloth Mr Chapman took the chair for the toasts and musical items, ending with the National Anthem.</p>

<p>The Kapunda Mine is progressing very satisfactorily. About twice as many are employed as at the start of the year. Smelting has been resumed under Mr Thomas Hitchins, thus allowing the exploitation of lower grade ores. A handsome roof of corrugated iron has been erected over two of the furnaces. It is believed to be the largest in the colony at 83 ft by 52 ft 6 inches. The centre is a curved 27 ft 6 inches span with two wings of straight metal 12 ft 6 inches. The mine is in fork to 50 fathoms. The promise of ore is abundant and the main problems are the want of cartage and the high price of provisions.</p>

<p>Accident. The Kooringa mail-cart on its way from Gawler Town to Kooringa on Friday last met with an accident. The only passengers were a man and his wife and child and another lad were the only passengers. At O’Leary’s public House they stopped and Mr Stanaway at the house invited the driver to have a nobbler. While he was in the house the horses started. The driver ran after them and succeeded in getting on the shaft, but was pulled off by Stanaway. He then ran alongside the horses and caught the reins. He held on with such tenacity that the horses swerved round and overturned the cart. The woman, child and driver were bruised, but not very seriously.</p>

He spoke for one hour and forty minutes on the Maine Liquor Law in the USA. He was loudly applauded at intervals and sat down to enthusiastic applause. Mr J. Rowe, the Bible Christian minister presided. The meeting was unanimously in favour of the Maine Liquor Law. There are monthly lectures in Kooringa on temperance. The last two had been given by the Bible Christian ministers Messrs Rowe and Ridclift. A great many have taken the pledge in the last three months.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held at the Burra Hotel on 11 August before Dr Mayne on the body of William Mollard.</p>
<p>James Bennett sworn, said he knew the deceased and saw him last alive yesterday. Between4 &amp; 5 o’clock he was employed raising iron ore for the Smelting Works at the Black Hill, four miles from Kooringa. I was working about five yards from him. I heard some rubbish give way. I looked around and could not see the deceased. I called to Henry James, my other comrade, that Mollard was killed. James immediately came to assist and while he went to get a shovel I heard the deceased moan. It took about five minutes to reach him and when recovered he was dead.</p>
<p>Henry James gave corroborating evidence. He too heard deceased moan while they were digging. They were working at a depth of about ten feet and should have considered the ground quite safe. The verdict was accidental death. [William Mollard died 10 August 1855 aged 23.]</p>

<p>G.S. Kingston writes an address to the Electors of the Burra. Major points in a very long piece:</p>
<p>The Legislative Council has been dissolved to go to the people on the subject of an amended Constitution.</p>
<p>I remain a sincere friend of civil and religious liberty.</p>
<p>I am opposed to class legislation and the nominee element in our present Constitution.</p>
<p>I voted for the Land Regulations that were intended to ease the obstacles that prevented the discoverer of minerals from benefiting from his discovery. The question of the Constitution to be laid before the new Council has been published in the Gazette Extraordinary at the equally extraordinary hour of midnight on 17 August.</p>
<p>The colonists have for years demanded responsible Government and the abolition of the nominee element in the Legislature.</p>
<p>Instead the Governor offers what is essentially a continuation of the present system. The executive will not be able to be dismissed by a vote of no confidence. It is intended that the official members of the Legislature shall have the same tenure of office as at present, namely, the will and pleasure of the Governor for the time being.</p>
<p>The just rights of the colonists must not be made a matter of bargain and sale, not must responsible government be withheld from us to suit the personal interests of three or four officials.</p>
<p>I have hitherto been opposed to a two chamber Legislature.</p>
<p>But it is imperative that we secure responsible government and control of the Land Fund without delay.</p>
<p>In 1853 the price for control of the Land Fund was agreeing to a nominee Upper House for life. I thought the price too high.</p>
<p>The position now has changed. Reading the despatches of Lord John Russell indicates that we must accept a proposal within the Act of 1850. This Act allows one chamber with one third nominees or two chambers, both of which may be wholly elective.</p>
<p>The Lower Chamber, I believe, should have the widest possible suffrage consistent with careful registration. Residence for six months being sufficient. Electorates should have as even a number of electors as possible.</p>
<p>I would also afford voters the security of the ballot.</p>
<p>I think the Upper House should be elected by the whole colony voting as one district for the entire number of members to be elected. One third of members to retire at each general election.</p>
<p>Should you wish again to have me as your representative, I would be most willing to serve.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held before Dr Mayne at the Burra Burra Hotel on 10 September on the body of John Gilles Robinson, found dead on the sofa of a public house kept by Mr Henry Nankervis near Kooringa [i.e. the Crossroads Inn].</p>
<p>The jury went to see the body, which presented a most frightful spectacle.</p>
<p>Henry Nankervis said he knew the deceased. Last saw him alive on Saturday at about 12.30. He appeared well, but complained of a fall he had had from a horse last Thursday. About 1.15 I went into his room and found him dead. He had complained for a day or two previously. When I saw him as 12 .15 he appeared frightened and said: ‘Nankervis, I am dying.’ He did not seem to be in a fit. His face was a little bruised on the right side from the fall. He was sober when I left him. He came to the house on Thursday and never left his room again. I did not have a doctor as he did not seem sufficiently ill. I did not send for a doctor when he said he was dying, as I have seen him many times worse than he was then. He did not ask for a doctor and did not say how he was thrown. He had three meals in mu house and appeared very hearty. I heard him complain of being ill about a month ago.</p>
<p>James George Guthrie gave evidence of seeing deceased at the hotel and talking to him. He had been with deceased when he suffered the fall from the horse. It was Guthrie’s mare and she had reared, and the deceased pulled her over on him. The mare seemed to fall on his chest, but he made no complaint when he got up. He seemed the same as usual when we arrived at Nankervis’s house. He was sober when I last saw him. He had been drinking at the Burra for the last week. [He describes their drinking habits.]</p>
<p>W.R, Carmichael, medical practitioner said he believed the deceased died of apoplexy. Being predisposed to apoplexy, the fall hastened his death. Apoplexy can be brought on by excessive drinking.</p>
<p>Constable William O’Shaughnessy gave evidence of being called to Nankervis’s to see the body. The face appeared to be downwards, and when the body was turned over, the nose was flattened, and the cheeks were swollen and purple on both sides.</p>
<p>The verdict was death from apoplexy, the fall from the horse combined with the effects of intemperance, being the immediate cause.</p>
<p>[SA Deaths CD records this death as John Gillies Robertson bide 8 September 1855, age not registered.]</p>

<p>The Court of Revision was held at the Burra Hotel. Copies of the last Electoral Roll had been posted at the Kooringa Court House and the Redruth Gaol. There were 100 claims for admission to the roll and no objections to them. Four names of persons now dead were struck off. Two names were corrected, leaving 500 names on the roll.</p>

<p>The first of a series of fortnightly meetings on this topic was held at the Welsh Chapel on 21 September. Joseph Sleep addressed a very large attendance and spoke on the evils of intemperance and the advantages of abstinence, from more than 15 years’ experience. Mr Tonkin gave a humorous speech and Mr Joseph Davies, after a short address in English, gave a speech to his countrymen in Welsh, going over the points made by speakers through the evening. Several names were added to those who have pledged abstinence.</p>

<p>Votes in the Burra Election</p>
<p>Majority for Kingston, 37.</p>
<p>The resulting changes to the Legislature are not as great as was thought likely at one time. Most of the old representatives have been returned. Two (of 16) chose to retire. One old member has lost the election and one has been replaced because he went back to England, making the new blood just 25% of elected members. It is, however, understood that none of the old nominee members will return. Two of them – Messrs Stephens and Grainger – are out of the colony. Mr Gwynne has indicated he would not again accept the position.</p>
<p>28 September 1855, page 3</p>
<p>G.D. Kingston writes to thank his supporters in the election, regretting that he cannot remain in Kooringa for the declaration of the poll, because of business commitments in the city. He says that his opponent agreed with all of the principles Kingston himself espoused and remarkably did not press his candidacy either with addresses in the newspaper or in person. Kingston says in fact that Mildred’s proponents ‘only brought him forward, to use their own terse and expressive language, “for the sake of a lark, and that some money might be spent at the public-house.”’</p>
<p>‘How far such men are deserving of the high privilege of the elective franchise, I leave their fellow-colonists to judge.’</p>
<p>Mildred ‘only made his appearance the evening before the poll, and was then only seen, owl-like, after a stealthy journey by night – ashamed, as it were, to show his face in the light of the sun.’</p>
<p>3 October 1855, page 3</p>
<p>Election Dinner at the Burra</p>
<p>G.S. Kingston’s election was celebrated by his supporters with a dinner at the Burra Hotel on 27 September. Dr T.H. Mayne took the chair and Mr T. Bath the vice-chair. Mr Thomas Burgess proposed the toast to Mr Kingston, extolling his virtues in extravagant terms. He said Kingston’s opponents had cast around for a candidate and had approached men of whose political opinions nothing was known and only at the last had they hit upon Mr Mildred, who had come out in haste. His professed principles were the same as Mr Kingston’s. Burgess said he had been employed by the SA Mining Company for seven years and had never been intimidated and always felt free to vote as he wished. All the objections to Mr Kingston were based upon his being a Burra Director, but why should that disqualify him, asked Mr Burgess. Mr Burgess stressed the importance of getting their supporters properly registered for voting. This would be even more important in the future because it was probable that the next election would see universal [male] franchise and the secret ballot.</p>
<p>Other speakers were Jos. Wood, and Mr Challoner who in proposing a toast to the Town and Trade of Kooringa, reminded the storekeepers of the town that every penny of their prosperity had come up in the kibbles, yet they would not sell them green ribbons, though they gave them blue ones. He trusted they would be more mindful of their obligations to the miners.</p>
<p>[The report of other toasts indicates the presence of J. Pearce, Mr Barker, Mr T. Burgess, Mr H. Fry, Mr Sampson, Mr T. Bath, Mr Bryant, Mr W. Woollacott, Mr J. Wood and Mr Henry Miller.]</p>
<p>4 October 1855, page 4</p>
<p>Robert Cowper writes re G.S. Kingston, would-be Member for the Burra.</p>
<p>[He says he has read Kingston’s letter of thanks with regret. He says Kingston thanks his committee for their untiring exertions. Firstly the committee was composed entirely of officers of the Mining and Smelting Companies. They certainly left undone nothing that would ensure a vote for Kingston, whether by intimidation or otherwise. The fact that Kingston’s opponent did not differ from him in his political principles was, says Cowper, common across the electorates of the colony. The comment that Mildred did not appear until the last minute is contemptible, since Kingston well knew the reason for it and as for asserting Mildred’s committee only did it for a lark! That is insulting and impudent. Kingston had also objected to some of his supporters being disenfranchised on the day because they had moved house and so their registration was incorrect. Cowper says in each case the objection was valid.]</p>

<p>Burra Election – Meeting of Mr Mildred’s Friends</p>
<p>A meeting of Mr Mildred’s supporters was held at the Miners’ Arms on 2 October. Mr A. Johnston took the chair.</p>
<p>The meeting was called to consider the address of Mr Kingston. The chairman read the address and said he thought they should do all in their power to vindicate Mr Mildred.</p>
<p>Mr Gubbings [sic: Gubbins?] suggested it would certainly have been advisable for Mr Kingston to have shown his face before Mr Mildred.</p>
<p>The Chairman then read Mr Mildred’s reply, which he said conformed to the laws of truth and justice. The expression that Mr Mildred had been brought forward as a lark could not have emanated from a gentleman.</p>
<p>The resolutions printed in the paper of 6 October were then passed.</p>

<p>Election Notice</p>
<p>A numerously attended meeting of Mr Mildred’s supporters held at the Miner’s Arms on 2 October resolved:</p>
<p>‘That this meeting having read Mr Kingston’s address to the Electors of the Burra, receive it with that utter contempt it so RICHLY deserves.’</p>
<p>‘That Mr Mildred’s reply be considered a full; fair, just, and true repudiation to the MEAN and UNMANLY address which Mr Kingston, in his gentlemanlike way thought proper to offer.’</p>

<p>Re the Kooringa Election – Mr Mildred’s Committee responds to Kingston’s address.</p>
<p>To the Manly Member for the Burra and all persons whom it may concern:</p>
<p>[The reply pours scorn on Kingston for his sneering contempt of the electors and the personal vituperation of his address. They defend Mildred’s late arrival on the scene as an indication of his perseverance, energy and promptitude in making the arduous journey after attending assiduously to his normal business. They were, of course, grossly insulted by the reference to their support for Mildred as a ‘lark’.</p>
<p>‘&hellip;and those whom you have grossly insulted and held up to ridicule may then be inclined to believe that your remarks emanated from a diseased mind, and not from a cold, deliberate, and well-disposed member of the Legislative Council of South Australia.’</p>
<p>The resolutions already printed in the paper of 6 October are then printed.]</p>

<p>SA Election – Dinner of Mr Mildred’s Friends</p>
<p>A large gathering of Mr Mildred’s friends took place for a dinner at the Pig &amp; Whistle last Tuesday evening. Dr Carmichael took the chair supported by Mr Cox, Mr Corey and Mr Johnston as vice-chairman.</p>
<p>Toasts were proposed or responded to by: Mr Thomas, Mr Barker, Mr Gubbins, Mr C.J. Ware, Mr Chapman, Mr Langmead, Mr Barclay, Mr Coward, Mr Weir and the chairman ad supporters named above.</p>
<p>Mr Johnston commented on Mr Challoner’s remark at the dinner honouring Mr Kingston:</p>
<p>‘&hellip;that every penny of the wealth of the Burra had come up in the ‘kibble.’ If that gentleman had really said so, he would beg to remind him that it was not so; that the settlers, teamsters, shepherds, &amp;c., had, more properly speaking, been the support of the trade and prosperity of the Burra, to say nothing of the produce of the gold-fields&hellip;He should recollect that all are mutually dependent on each other.’</p>
<p>18 October 1855, page 2</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]</p>
<p>The prosperity and stability of the SA economy owes a great deal to the extent, richness and permanency of her copper mines. The great potential for grain production requires a market and in the future it is likely that export markets for this will be closed. The development of the economy in SA will provide an internal market.</p>
<p>The shareholders of the Burra Burra Mine held their half-yearly meeting yesterday and the company’s affairs were found to be in a most satisfactory and flourishing condition. When the great exodus of miners to the gold-fields took place, the Directors of the Burra Burra Mine suspended work and allowed the mine to flood with water. Since the resumption of operations and the erection of the large engine, this has all been got out, but it was not until last May that production began again from the lowest levels. Here success has been much greater than was anticipated at the last half-yearly meeting. In the 50 fathom level at Peacock’s Shaft, the lode, it seems, is fifteen feet wide and is turning out malachite and red oxide of copper in good quality, whilst the lodes in the other workings are looking well. The ore on hand on 31 March last was 3,251 tons and since then 4,409 tons have been raised, making 7,760 tons. Of this 3,094 tons have been delivered to the English &amp; Australian Copper Co., whilst 4,566 tons remain on hand at the Mine. The mean average of the 4,409 tons produced in the last six months is 24% and for the last two ‘takes’ is 27%. Since the last half-yearly meeting the smelted copper exported has been 2141⁄2 tons, while there are 161 tons on hand. The balance of profit, on the realization of copper and ore, as shown in the accounts, is £61,510.</p>
<p>This is enough to pay five quarterly dividends of 100% each. Directors therefore have decided to resume dividend payments on 1 December next. There is no reason to doubt that large quantities of ore will continue to be raised. The Directors say they are still in great want of labour.</p>
<p>Another mining property of the Burra proprietary is the Karkulto Mine, a few miles to the south of Kooringa. This is likely to become highly productive, as an important lode of ore has been found there in recent days. It is the intention of Directors to test this thoroughly, as soon as miners become redundant at the Burra.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held before J.W. Macdonald Esq. on 22 October at the Burra Burra Hotel on the body of James White.</p>
<p>Isaac Holder: I saw deceased at 5.30 a.m. Saturday. Have known him for about four years. We shook hand and he asked for his ‘morning.’ I at first refused, but later gave him 6d. He appeared sober and in good health. He was sober when I saw him at 4 p.m. He said he had been in a row.</p>
<p>Charles Laper, maker of lemonade and soda water for Mr Barker. Deceased was well on the first night here, but a little tipsy on Saturday. He was wrestling and dancing on Saturday night. I recollect he had a quarrel with R. Roscrow, both being tipsy. Heard him swearing. A Spaniard went to him and shook him. He then became quiet and went to sleep again. The Spaniard called me in the morning and White was then dead.</p>
<p>[There was some evidence then of a fight on Friday night.]</p>
<p>William Brown said White was drunk when he came and appeared to have been so for some time. After the first night he only had what he could beg from others.</p>
<p>Richard Roscrow. First saw deceased at the bar on Thursday. He was then well, but very drunk. We had a quarrel on Friday when he had been asking for a drink from several persons. We wrestled in the tap-room and a man named Bill Davey struck me. I never struck the deceased and he did not strike me. Did not see anyone strike or kick him.</p>
<p>[When questioned by the jury Roscrow had to admit he had been so drunk that he recalled little and his evidence was in part what he was told had happened.]</p>
<p>Thomas Pearce described the Friday fight and said he saw Roscrow kick deceased, but it did not seem very hard. Deceased had got up and tried to strike Roscrow. They did not fight any more.</p>
<p>Roscrow had struck the witness. He had been very drunk and quarrelsome.</p>
<p>William Richard Carmichael, medical practitioner, said he had seen the deceased in Kapunda. He appeared to be half insane and was generally tipsy. His liver was much enlarged and diseased. There was congestion in the brain from previous intemperance. There was no sign on his head that he had received violence. There were no bruises on the body. I say deceased on Friday and Saturday when he appeared tipsy and half insane. There were no marks on his chest. I believe his death was due to hard drinking.</p>
<p>Verdict was death of congestion of the brain, brought on by intemperate habits, and hastened by sudden excitement.</p>
<p>‘At the request of the Jury, the Coroner was to have reprimanded Roscrow for his extreme drunkenness, but, on being sent for, the policeman returned with the intelligence that he had gone to the bush horse-hunting.’</p>
<p>[James White died 21 October 1855 aged 38.]</p>

<p>‘In June last a shepherd in the employ of Mr Chambers, whilst travelling from the North-west Bend to the Burra, discovered some human remains about 20 miles from the Murray; he also found at the same place a watch and some papers. From these latter it is ascertained almost beyond a doubt that the remains in question are those of two Germans named Weber, a druggist and Schroder, a miner. These two unfortunate men left the Burra in November, 1851, intending to go to the Murray. They had been met on the road by a Mr Plausowsky, who found them destitute of provisions, and who relieved them to such extent as he could. It is supposed, with every probability, that they perished from hunger.’</p>

<p>Kooringa Court, 7 November</p>
<p>Gubbins v. MacInnerny</p>
<p>Gubbins claimed £5 for a bag of flour purchased from the defendant as the best fine flour. It turned out to be grossly inferior. Robert Roach and J.W. Moore, bakers of Kooringa testified to the inferior quality of the flour and said it was fit only for pigs. Several other witnesses proved both the inferior quality of the flour and the warrant given by the defendant. Gubbins was awarded £5 plus costs. A series of cases of a similar nature saw awards of £5 and costs to Bennett, Godden, Bowden, Vivian, Symons, Lutze, Andrews, Lane and Torr.</p>
<p>Barclay sued Thompson for £1-14-4 for board and lodging and won the same.</p>

<p>Burra Burra &amp; Other Mines</p>
<p>The year 1855 has been very successful. It began with a major effort to reduce the water level in the mine. The 250 horse-power engine was worked incessantly and by the end of January the water was ‘in fork’. Upon examining the levels the company found the mine to be secure and began employing as many men as they could get together. Before the end of March they were employing 450 and at the end of May the figure was 560. At the same time the Kapunda Mine was in full swing. While the profitable mines were working strongly a number of unprofitable ventures were being wound up. These operations included the North Kapunda Co., Greenock Creek, Breadalbane, Glenalbyn, Prince Albert, Adelaide, North Rhine and Outside Kapunda companies.</p>
<p>The 10th Annual report of the Burra Burra Company was issued in May, at which time no dividend was declared because of the apprehended difficulty of getting ore to market in the winter, yet the Directors presented a highly encouraging statement to their shareholders.</p>
<p>The half-yearly meeting was held on 17 October and revealed a most flourishing operation. In Peacock’s Shaft at the 50 fathom level the lode was 15 ft wide, consisting of malachite and red oxide of copper of excellent character. Lodes in other levels are looking equally good. On 31 March the company had more than 3,000 tons of ore on hand and a further 4,409 tons had been raised by the mid-year report. The mean averages for the ores were 24-27%. The balance of profit on hand was £61,510 being sufficient to pay five quarterly dividends of 100%.</p>
<p>At about the time of the half-yearly report a rich discovery of ore was made at their Karkulto Mine a few miles south of Kooringa.</p>
<p>At the Kapunda Mine Captain Bagot’s furnaces for reducing ore to regulus have been in steady operation.</p>
<p>Activities are also looking up at Mt Remarkable. Other places where hopes were entertained were the new Stony Creek diggings between Woodside and Lobethal where a new Bendigo was hoped for. But the yield proved disappointing. Echunga is also seeing little activity at present.</p>

<p>Christmas at Kooringa</p>
<p>On Wednesday some wrestling took place at the Miners’ Arms.</p>
<p>On Monday a fine bullock was killed and dressed by Messrs Stevens and M. Watts and roasted whole near the Burra Burra Hotel. Several fine slices were cut from it about noon and by 6 p.m. it was considerably diminished. Mr J. Pearce then collected together about 40 natives, who gave three hearty cheers for Queen Victoria, three more for Prince Albert and then three for the Royal Family. Mr Pearce then helped them to the remainder of the bullock and in a short time nothing but bones remained.</p>
<p>Several foot races were held between men, boys, girls and blackfellows. The usual enjoyments of jingling*, jumping in sacks etc. concluded the day.</p>
<p>Horse races were held at the Mr Nankervis’s Cross Roads Inn.</p>

<p>Court, Kooringa, 9 January, before T.H. Mayne JP</p>
<p>John Macdonald was charged with having stolen an order from James Eade on 8 January. He had been drinking with the prisoner and had given him an order for something over £6 to pay for the drinks and to bring him the change. Eade had left the hotel without returning the change.</p>
<p>John Barkwell said that yesterday the prisoner had been in a fight and his shirt was torn so lent him my coat. This morning I went and got my coat and having heard of the dispute over the order I gave it to another man standing nearby and told him to search it for anything not belonging to me. He found nothing. When I put the coat on the prisoner came up, saying he was looking for a pipe. Someone said the prisoner had then put something in the pocket and I had better give it to the policeman. Took the coat off and gave it to the policeman.</p>
<p>John Bestie, policeman had information about the alleged offence and arrived as Barkwell was taking off his coat. Searched the coat and found two orders rolled up in a ball in the pocket to value of £6-0-10.</p>
<p>John Benjamin said the prisoner had bought a shirt from him the previous day and gave him an order for £6-6-0. He believed the two orders produced were those he gave as change.</p>
<p>John Macdonald claimed that he and Eade were both drunk, but Eade was the worse. Eade had given him the £6-6-0 order and told him to pay for two nobblers and to get a shirt. I got the nobblers, but could not get change. Went to Mr Benjamin’s and got the shirt and the two orders produced as change. Then went behind an old bakehouse and went to sleep. In the morning I went to the hotel and found Eade with others. I was not then aware that I had not given him the change. Committed for trial.</p>

<p>Escape from Redruth Gaol</p>
<p>A lunatic escaped from the gaol on Tuesday evening while the keeper was in his own house upon business and the turnkey was in another part of the yard. The man scaled the gate before the turnkey could prevent him. Mr Perry, the gaol-keeper was immediately informed and gave chase. After about a mile and a half he succeeded in recapturing the prisoner. The blame does not attach to the turnkey, but is due to the want of proper security at the gaol. It is to be hoped that construction of the new gaol will soon commence, giving proper security and accommodation to prisoners.</p>
<p>Miska Hauser at the Burra. This justly celebrated violinist made his first appearance in Burra on Wednesday at the large room at the Burra Burra Hotel before a most respectable audience. His performance greatly exceeded expectations and every piece was followed by deafening applause. Mr Bial was also warmly applauded in the several solos played by him on the piano. The services of a German lady had been secured before the arrival of Miska Hauser and she sang twice during the evening, but owing to its being the first time she had appeared in public, she appeared rather timid and so was not heard to as great an advantage as she otherwise would. Miska Hauser gave a second concert on Thursday, assisted by Mr Bial and a lady. This concert was also very well attended and his wonderful performance on the violin appeared truly magical.</p>

<p>The Main North Road</p>
<p>£1,616 has been expended on this road and with a trifling exception it has all been expended between Bowden and Gawler. Some 63⁄4 miles of previously unmade road have been metalled 18 ft wide and other repairs done. There remains 71⁄4 miles of roadway to be metalled. The cost cannot be less than £1,400 per mile. The fact that almost the entire distance has now been fenced makes improvement essential. Several un-metalled portions will become impassable in winter. Some of the old metalled sections are becoming very worn, even though the work was very thoroughly done originally. From Gawler to Burra nothing at all has been done except for a grant towards making a ford over the Dirty Light near Hamilton. The defects between Gawler and Kapunda saw a survey made last year, but the high costs have so far proved a bar. The bridge and approaches over the Light near the Miners’ Arms are about to be commenced. Quite a length of road south of Bagot’s Gap is being fenced, which will certainly be impassable next winter.</p>
<p>On the branch to Clare a little over £12,000 was spent in 1855. The new bridge and approaches over the Light at the Burra Company’s crossing are complete also the new bridge and approaches over the Gilbert near Forrester’s. A new line of road has been opened near Forrester’s, another between Baker’s public house and Auburn and a third between Leasingham and Watervale. A bridge has been built over Jacob’s Creek by the District Council of Clare, by means of a grant from the Board. Nevertheless, only a trifling distance along this road has been metalled. Fencing along this route will also render parts impassable in winter.</p>

<p>Mules and Their Drivers</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon between 200 and 300 mules were gathered near Thebarton Bridge. They belong to the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. and are usually employed carrying copper and coal between Port Wakefield and the Burra Smelting Works. They were brought from Willaston that morning (26 miles) and were depastured for the night. They were there to take north some new wagons just arrived from England and which will be loaded with coal for the smelters. Each mule carried his light harness wound about his body. The fine dark figures of their Chilean drivers were even more striking. Some were in traditional dress and wore the large spurs used in South America, with rowels as large as the palms of their hands. Several paid a visit to Adelaide in the evening, which attracted considerable attention.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary</p>
<p>A boy named Turley met his death on Friday night by falling down a shaft at the Burra Burra Mine. He was employed as a whim boy and was working a double shift in order to have a holiday the following day. He seems to have lain down inside the fence around the shaft and fallen asleep. When woken to commence work he either walked or rolled into the shaft and fell to the 40 fathom level. An inquest was held at the Burra Burra Hotel by Dr Mayne. Richard Goldsworthy said he was told at about 11.30 that the deceased had either walked or rolled into Graham’s Shaft. Went with Henry Bastion and found the body at the 40 fathom level. He was dead. The shaft is fenced to prevent accidents and the boy’s work was 18 ft from the shaft. He drives the whim. Anyone can see the shaft and he had no business taking him to the shaft. Joseph Sleep said he saw deceased about 11 p.m. He and his boy sat down with the deceased for about a quarter of an hour. I then ascertained he was inside the fence and told him to come out as it was dangerous. Was not aware he had not come out until the knocker went. I went to see if he was there and heard a kind of bustling noise, but no cry. Suspected he had fallen in and sent my boy to tell Captain Dick. I went below to find him, but Henry Bastion discovery the body first.</p>
<p>John Nankivell had been working at the 20 fathom level when he heard that a boy had fallen. Went down to the 40 fathom and found Henry Bastion with the body. When Captain Dick and Richard Bastion came we put deceased into a kibble and hauled him up. W.R. Carmichael MD had looked at the body and said the immediate cause of death was concussion of the brain and a fractured skull and the left thigh bone was broken. Death would have been instantaneous. The verdict was accidental death.</p>
<p>[Thomas Turley died 25 January 1856 aged 12. BISA adds Thomas Henry Turley and says he arrived with his family from Kent in 1848.]</p>

<p>Notes of a Ten Days’ Tour to the Murray and the North</p>
<p>[Almost four columns of small print.]</p>
<p>On Monday 10 March a party of five set out from Rundle Street and travelled via Campbelltown, Paradise, Anstey’s Hill, Houghton, Chain of Ponds, Lyndoch, Tanunda, Penrice, Angaston, Truro and Moorundee (Blanchetown) to North-West Bend. [This is narrated in great detail.]</p>
<p>About five miles towards Moorundee from North-West Bend is Von Rieben’s Hotel, from where there is no human habitation until within a few miles of Burra Burra.</p>
<p>From Von Rieben’s to Burra Burra is 50-60 miles and of this 40-45 miles are over an entirely waterless plain. There is a track, which remains from an attempt by the SA Mining Association to get a particular type of sand some years ago. Unfortunately we missed it, but eventually came across it by travelling northwest until our path intersected the track. Few people attempt this crossing and one of the few was the late Mr Hamilton, Inspector of Sheep, who paid for it with a fit of illness, which detained him some time in Kooringa.</p>
<p>The soil along the way is a red loam clay and there is little or no sand. The country is thinly dotted with trees arranged in clumps, a mile or two apart, and separated by shrubs with beautiful foliage and brilliant blossoms. Teatree flourishes in places. The appearance suggests that water might be easily got by sinking and if it could be obtained the area could be magnificent for agriculture.</p>
<p>We encountered a pair of emus about midway across the plains. We also came across a native funeral pyre. [One of the party took the skull and later presented it to the museum in Adelaide.] At Baldina Creek many sheep and cattle are depastured. It rained as we approached Kooringa, where we arrived wet to the skin and quite lost in the darkness. It is easy to reach Kooringa via the Adelaide Road, but to approach from the east is another matter in the pitch dark. It took us an hour of wandering and misdirection before we sat down to a good cup of tea at Barker’s Hotel. This is an enormous stone edifice – too large for its trade - built some years since by William Paxton. It stands as the first house on entering Burra from Adelaide and consequently lies outside the town, which seems rather to be receding from it, rather than growing towards it.</p>
<p>The Burra is situated in a circle of hills, which rise around the three townships of Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen, which make up Burra Burra. In its heart is a tortuous creek and the whole area is intersected by deep creeks and gullies formed by the large volumes of water coming down from the hills. Some years ago for one and a half miles along the creek some 2,000 persons were living in caves dug out of its side. The chimneys of which consist of shafts opening into the roadway above, with the orifices protected by beer barrels or other contrivances. A great flood washed out these subterraneous tenements and now nothing remains of these former dwellings but the holes that served for chimneys.</p>
<p>There is no municipality or local government and the roads are fast being washed away by immense creeks, which are opened every winter. There is nowhere else in the colony where some kind of local regulations are so much needed.</p>
<p>‘The whole place wears an aspect of great desolation: no allotments are enclosed; no gardens are planted; no vegetation can be seen; even the hilltops are unable to boast a single tree amongst them. The dwellings look as if dropped from the clouds; and with the exception of a few tradespeople, who have opened really handsome shops, the whole population might be supposed to be in the act of packing up to be off. Even the very buildings, though formed of a most durable blue clay slate, are put together as if they were only wanted to hold up for a few years until the final exodus took place.’</p>
<p>We went to the Rev. Ibbetson’s Church of England service, where he preached to about twenty-three adults and a few children. The Methodists were however, well attended and the external morals of the town are much improved, owing greatly to the enforcement of the public-house law on Sundays by Sergeant Bolus over the past three months.</p>
<p>On Sunday 15 March a terrific thunderstorm broke and rain fell in a deluge. The sun the next day turned the town into a steam bath. We visited the Burra Burra Works where Captain Roach showed us over the premises of the SA Mining Association. We were too late to go down a shaft and had to be content with surface matters. The enormous engine of 240 HP with a beam of 30 tons works 65,000 strokes a week and is a beautiful piece of machinery. It pumps the water from the deeper levels of the mine. This water is then used for washing the ore and other mine purposes. A new shaft is being sunk below the 50 fathom level, for which great hopes are entertained. Vast heaps of ore lie on the ground in hues of blue, green, red and brown. The works are busy with men and horses everywhere. The Mines are conducted with singular freedom from accident and as there is no fire damp, candles are used at all levels. The Company is fortunate in having the energetic Captain Roach, whose aim appears to be to have all in first rate order. We were shown a magnificent cabinet of specimens on ores.</p>
<p>Illness forced the party to be split into two at this point and two members with the guide set out for Apoinga via Sod Hut. Some work continues to be done at Apoinga, where some 100 to 150 loads of wood are consumed in smelting every week. The men ruined the works when the gold rush broke out, because the management refused to let them go before the completion of their contract. As a consequence the proprietor suffered heavy losses. Hundreds of tons of slag it is said will pay for re-smelting. An immense mass of copper was lately discovered at the bottom of one of the furnaces. It took 14 bullocks to drag it out.</p>
<p>[The party then returned to Adelaide by way of Tothill’s Creek, Hamilton, Kapunda, Sheoak Log, Gawler, Little Para, Dry Creek and Nailsworth.]</p>
<p>28 March 1856, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School celebrated its anniversary last Sunday. Sermons were preached by Mr Wright and in the evening by Mr Jolly of Mintaro. In the afternoon addresses were given by Rev. M. Wilson and Mr Jolly of Mt Barker. [Sic] On Monday at 2 o’clock the children (about 40) were led in procession through the town and then regaled with tea and cakes. There was a public tea-meeting at 5 p.m. at which about 250 sat down. Mr Robinson presided over the public meeting. Proceeds from the Anniversary amounted to £29.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Oddfellows Lodge</p>
<p>On 25 March about 50 members had a dinner at the Burra Burra Hotel where Mr Barker provided a sumptuous feast. At the head of the table were T.W. Powell (Chair), PGM W. Pearce (Vice Chair), Mr Macdonald SM, Dr Mayne JP, PG Brewer and NG Birbeck. Past Grand Pearce was presented with a silver hunting watch in appreciation of his past service to the Lodge and in particular for his role in the re-forming of the Lodge upon the return of some of its members from the gold fields.</p>
<p>[Other members mentioned as playing a role were PGM Brother Brewer, GM Brother Dawson, PGM Brother Wells, Mr Weir, Warden Corey, Mr Thomas, PGM Brother Pinch &amp; Mr Johnstone.]</p>
<p>[In one response to a toast NG Birbeck said that about three years ago there were scarcely enough members to form a lodge and now they had 96 good on the books.]</p>

<p>Upper Wakefield. 44 ratepayers have petitioned the Governor to annex certain land to the west of Upper Wakefield to that district because the vast traffic between the Burra Burra Mines and Port Wakefield is flooding the area with cattle seeking feed and water and while the land remains outside a proclaimed district, these activities cannot be controlled.

<p>Local Court, Kooringa 3 April, before J.W. Macdonald, Stipendiary Magistrate.</p>
<p>Manuel Lopez was charged with stealing a watch to the value of £3-10-0 from John Fisher.</p>
<p>Fisher said on 31 March he entered the Redruth Arms to change his shirt, as he was wet. He took off his waistcoat and laid it down, and afterwards could not find it until Wednesday morning, when he found it in the taproom among other old clothes. When he took it off the watch was in the pocket. He heard that Lopez had the watch and asked him for it. Lopez did not understand English and His Worship adjourned the case in order to obtain an interpreter.</p>
<p>8 April</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson was sworn as interpreter. Lopez said he and another Spaniard were entering the White Hart Hotel, with the other man in front of him when he noticed the watch and picked it up outside the hotel. He went in and got £1 on the watch, which he later paid back for drink.</p>
<p>Committed for trial and admitted to bail, himself in £25 and with one surety in £25.</p>
<p>17 April 1856, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The eleventh annual meeting of the Association was held yesterday. The report indicates the continuing progress of the venture. Ore raised in the year to 31 March 1855 was 6,862 tons, the cost of production was £54,920-1-1, or £8-0-1 per ton. The ore realised £82,319-9-9 or £11-19-11 per ton, giving a profit of £3-19-10 per ton, which gave an aggregate profit of £27,399-18-8. To this is added the sum of £869-3-11 for rent, exchange etc. to give a profit for the year of £28,269-2-7. From this two dividends were paid amounting to £24,640.</p>
<p>The yield of ore for the six months ended 31 March 1856 has been 5,450 tons at an estimated 27% copper. This is the mine’s best result for the last four years. For the bulk raised it is perhaps the richest yield of copper for any mine in the world presently in production. The profit account to the end of the last quarter, based upon modest calculations as to results, and including the balance of profits from last year, is £85,654-6-0. This is the largest sum the company has ever had at one time for division amongst shareholders. The continuous payment of quarterly dividends is of course guaranteed by this large balance, though the amount has not yet been realised.</p>
<p>We have been favoured with the items of expenditure included under the heading of ‘Charges’, which show the entire cost of managing the SA Mining Association for the year from 31 March 1854 to 31 March 1855. The management consisted of a Board of nine Directors, a Secretary, and three clerks in Adelaide; a chief Captain with three assistant Captains, an assayer, an accountant, a clerk and a storekeeper at the mines. Thus:</p>
<p>Fees paid for Directors’ attendance</p>
<p>at meetings @ 21/- per meeting 350</p>
<p>Salaries of the four Adelaide officers 1,330</p>
<p>Salaries of the eight officers at the Mine 2,214</p>
<p>Adelaide office rent 125</p>
<p>Cleaning the Adelaide office 20</p>
<p>Directors’ expenses visiting the Mine 130</p>
<p>Officers’ travelling expenses 20</p>
<p>Entertainment allowance for visitors at the Mine 50</p>
<p>Auditors’ fees 31-10-0</p>
<p>Law expenses 27</p>
<p>Advertising &amp; printing 210</p>
<p>Stationery 25</p>
<p>Petty expenses, postage, fuel etc. 25</p>
<p>Total £4,557-10-0</p>
<p>The work of the year to which these figures refer consisted of supervising an average of 400 workmen employed in the production of 6,862 tons of copper ore; the preparation for market and the delivery to the Copper Company, and the receipt from them of 732 tons of copper in return, the shipment and sale of the latter to England and India, conducting the correspondence concerned therewith, the keeping of the accounts and the disbursement of £80,142, including £26,960 pf profit, divided among the shareholders in three dividends.</p>
<p>The expenses of management for the year just ended amounted to £5,008. Ore raised was 9,859 tons. Total expenditure was £127,664-11-5, including £28,015 paid in dividends. The estimated profit for the year is set down at £81,010-17-11. The average number of men employed was 650.</p>
<p>Wages paid during the past half-year (average per week):</p>
<p>100 men (labourers) £1-13-0</p>
<p>20 boys (ditto) 0-13-6</p>
<p>21 mechanics 3-0-0</p>
<p>69 miners (tutwork) 2-9-1</p>
<p>258 miners (tributers) 2-17-51⁄2</p>
<p>40 timbermen 1-15-0</p>
<p>12 timbermen 2-5-0</p>
<p>Ore-dressers 1-15-0</p>
<p>The Captain’s report on the progress of the mine is generally exceedingly favourable, though in connecting Ayers’ No. 2 Shaft with Schneider’s and Roaches at the 50 fathom they passed through several fathoms of hard rock where they had expected to be in lode. The company’s establishment at Kooringa consists of 674 persons including 357 miners, of whom 258 are tributers. There are 176 ore-dressers, 98 labourers, 32 mechanics and 11 officers. The entire staff of the company is 688 persons.</p>
<p>The seven year contract with the Patent Copper Company (now the English &amp; Australian Copper Company) for the sale of ores raised at the mine, expired this month, but it expected that a new contract will be made with the company. There are upwards of 4,000 tons of ore on hand yet to be delivered under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>The company is sinking a suitable shaft on their Karkulto property, with a view to working the large and rich copper lode discovered there.</p>
<p>The exports of copper from the Burra Burra Mine this year are likely to add considerably to the wealth of the colony as well as to the fortunate owners of the company.</p>

<p>Most of the relevant information is in the editorial report on page 2. This official report carries the more detailed financial statements. It does say that 12 men are sinking Schneider’s Engine Shaft, which is now 3 fathoms below the 50 fathom level. Drives now connect Ayers’ No. 2, Schneider’s and Roach’s Shafts. Preparations are in hand to sink Ayers’ No. 1 to fifty fathoms and Roach’s to the 60 fathom level. The stamps are in operation and working well and the wheelpit and house for the new crusher are under construction.</p>

<p>Burra Primitive Methodists held a public tea-meeting on Tuesday 29 April when about 250 sat down to eat, but so limited is the accommodation in their chapel that places had to be set and cleared five times to satisfy the crowd. For the public meeting that followed there were so many standing outside that the gathering adjourned to the Bible Christian Chapel. Addresses were given by Rev. Mr Wright and Mr Hillman. The addresses were mainly aimed at their object in doubling the size of their chapel. Total profits from the meeting were £14-3-6. Subscription lists have been open and to date more than £200 has been promised. Mr Wright may safely expect to be soon able to accommodate his congregation, which is daily increasing.</p>

<p>English &amp; Australian Copper Co.</p>
<p>The manager has recently petitioned the Legislative Council asking them to expend money on the road between the Burra Burra and Port Wakefield. There are at present 4,000 tons of copper ore at Kooringa and 4,000 tons of coal at Port Wakefield, which cannot be moved until fine weather commences. The company says that in the past seven months it has spent more than £20,000 in cartage and in seven years more than £100,000. During the business season the company’s expenditure in the colony has reached £14,000 per month. It was seeking a grant of £5,000 to aid the company’s expenditure on road formation between Kooringa and Port Wakefield.</p>

<p>The Murray Railway</p>
<p>[Editorial: The proposal for a line to the Murray is a great work. It deserves an informed public debate. The route and the cost are the main issues. There is a great difference between a line via Light’s Pass to Moorundee and one via the Burra Mines to North-West Bend. The first would require about 90 miles of railway, while the latter would need about 150. Surveys have been undertaken and we hope the results will be put before the public. A railway not only passes through country, but also has the potential to open it up to development. The Burra route would pass through a vast tract of good country, though doubtless the problems of the Burra Ranges would counter some of the route’s advantages. The greater length is a problem of immediate cost, but that need not be a deciding factor. The longer route may for instance facilitate greater production in the colony, cheapen food in the Adelaide market and increase exports.</p>
<p>The City to Port Adelaide Railway cost about £25,000 per mile, of which about £10,000 was for the permanent way and the rest for rolling stock, stations etc. The 8,240 miles of railway in England to the end of 1855 are estimated to have cost about £35,000 per mile. Railways here can be cheaper; single line, lighter rolling stock, and simple stations until traffic justifies more. However economically we work, it will nevertheless be an expensive project.</p>
<p>Messrs Stevens &amp; Coke have decided to send a barge with flour up the Murray to the Victorian Gold fields. This has sparked great interest in the other colonies, with talk about the implications of both river trade and railways. The likely extension of Victorian railways to the gold fields means that the development of SA lands along our railway must be a major consideration and not just the benefits of tapping any inter-colonial trade.</p>

<p>Local Court, Kooringa, 23 May</p>
<p>William R. Carmichael, surgeon, was charged by Dr Mayne with have stolen certain books left in his charge by Dr Lloyd, the former occupant of his house, and of having placed them in the hands of Messrs Binney Bros. for sale.</p>
<p>Case remanded to next Wednesday.</p>
<p>26 May</p>
<p>T.H. Mayne JP, surgeon, was charged with assault with intent by Mary Ann Holland.</p>
<p>Prosecutrix said that on 20 February Dr Carmichael had left her alone in the house. She heard a step in the kitchen while she was in a bedroom. When she left the bedroom Dr Mayne said he had seen Dr Carmichael leave for Redruth and had taken the opportunity to see her alone. He asked whether Dr Carmichael had married a Mrs Johnston. He kissed her and she had run out. She went to the kitchen and he followed. She then ran into the parlour, thinking to escape the house by the front door. Before she could unlock the door Dr Mayne had caught her and dragged her into the bedroom. She struggled, but was overpowered. (The actual attempted assault was then described.) She prevailed and sat crying on the edge of the bed. Mayne asked her why she made such a noise, as the window was open. She said it was not open, but a pane was broken. She then went to the kitchen and after a while he followed. He said she should not leave the Burra, but he would get a house for her there. She said she did not care what he got for her; she would not stop with a married man. She said she would go to her brother in Van Diemen’s Land. He offered to get her anything she wanted, but she said she wanted nothing; she got all she wanted from her master. He asked if she would come to him the following day if Dr Carmichael went out. She said she would not. He then said he would come every night when Dr Carmichael went to Kapunda the next week. She said he should not and all the doors would be locked. Dr Carmichael then came home and asked what was the matter. She told him Dr Mayne had been very free in his manner. She said her health was bad and she had no money or she would have prosecuted at that time. When questioned by Dr Mayne she said she was living in prostitution with Dr Carmichael, but under a solemn promise of marriage. Had a miscarriage 3 January and Dr Mayne attended. She was aware Dr Mayne had brought a charge of felony against Dr Carmichael. She was aware Mayne had written a note to Dr Carmichael to prevent his going to Karkulto. She knew Dr Carmichael was negotiating with Dr Mayne for Dr Lloyd’s furniture, but she did not know the furniture could not be removed before it was paid for. She said Mayne has sent a bill to Dr Carmichael and therefore could not stop the furniture; only sue for it. In answer to a question she said that while in the kitchen Mayne had said he had always intended to become intimate with her from the first time he had seen her.</p>
<p>W.R. Carmichael said he had asked Dr Mayne on 21 February if he had been to his house and made free with his servant. He told Mayne not to come there again. Mayne had said ‘All right, all right’, but had appeared quite confused. On a subsequent occasion Mayne had described it all as a skylark, merely to try her. Later Mayne had asked him why he had spread the story and he had told Mayne that it was the prosecutrix who had done so and that she would not be dissuaded by him. [Though Carmichael admitted telling some, including the landlord of a Kapunda Hotel.]</p>
<p>Augustus Johnson was sworn and said he had been told of the alleged incident by Dr Carmichael in the Miners’ Arms and later repeated the story at his home in the presence of the prosecutrix.</p>
<p>The prosecutrix agreed that it would be best not to say anything about it because it would prevent Dr Mayne using his influence on behalf of Dr Carmichael [in getting a position at the Karkulto Mine].</p>
<p>For the defence Andrew Thomas was sworn. He heard that Dr Carmichael had circulated a story about Dr Mayne taking liberties with his servant and heard Corporal Bolus and James Pearce talk to Dr Carmichael about it, when he said there was no foundation for it and he was sorry the story had spread.</p>
<p>Corporal Bolus corroborated Thomas’s account.</p>
<p>John Goodfellow recalled Dr Carmichael returning from Kapunda, having gone there to see about his horses. Goodfellow had taken a note from Mayne to Carmichael in consequence of the spread of the story. Carmichael came over to Mayne’s at once and said there was no foundation for the report. He said that he had not said anything about it to the Landlord of the Sir John Franklin in Kapunda. Goodfellow swore that on both the 20 and 21 February he and Dr Mayne were out looking for a mare between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Goodfellow was Dr Mayne’s brother-in-law and he said he had been placed outside to hear what had been said [between Carmichael and Mayne].</p>
<p>His Worship dismissed the case.</p>

<p>Proposed Bridge at Kooringa</p>
<p>A public meeting was held at Kooringa last Thursday evening at the Burra Burra Hotel for the purpose of petitioning the SA Mining Association to build a bridge across the main creek. J.W Macdonald JP took the chair.</p>
<p>The following resolutions were carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Moved Mr Johnson and seconded Mr C.J. Ware:</p>
<p>‘That it is the opinion of this meeting that a bridge across the main creek, between Market-square and the Company’s weighbridge, is requisite for the purpose of facilitating the traffic through this township to the Smelting Works.’</p>
<p>Moved Mr Stanbury and seconded Mr Genders:</p>
<p>‘That the South Australian Mining Association be memorialised to build the said bridge, assisted by the tradesmen of Kooringa.’</p>
<p>[The memorial is then printed. It draws attention to the losses sustained by tradesmen because of the circuitous route now necessary via Redruth and Aberdeen to get to the Smelting Works. They wanted a bridge as near as practicable to Market-square and undertook upon the acquiescence of the Mining Association to open a subscription list towards defraying the expense of the bridge. They also claim that where 20 drays use to pass now only one does because of the communication being cut off by the enlargement of the Bible Christian Chapel.]</p>

<p>Proposed Kooringa Mechanics’ Institute</p>
<p>A public meeting of more than 90 persons was held on Friday 6 June in the large room at the Burra Hotel. J.W. Macdonald took the chair, introduced the subject and called upon Rev. Wright to speak. He moved ‘That this meeting views with deep concern and regret the absence of all means of providing instructive recreation for the inhabitants of the Burra, and the consequent loss sustained intellectually and morally by those whose education has been hitherto neglected and by many others whose hopes and opportunities of improvement are thus destroyed and taken away.’ He went on to address these issues with an emphasis on the moral advancement that such an institution might encourage. He said: ‘Knowledge of letters was good, knowledge of things better; knowledge of principle better still; but knowledge of a creator best of all.’</p>
<p>Mr Motley seconded the motion and spoke warmly in its support. It was a project to which he would give his utmost endeavour to drive forward. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson moved the second motion: ‘That in the opinion of this meeting, a mechanics’ institute is much needed in this township; and that it would if established be eminently useful in improving the morals, promoting the comfort, increasing the information, and securing the good order of the people.’</p>
<p>He was glad to see so many present and thought the only obstacle was the securing of money for the project. On his visit to Adelaide he had raised the matter with the Secretary of the SA Mining Association, who had spoken favourably of it, and he was sure that the Association would not only subscribe towards it, but contribute annually. He had also spoken to the Governor who was also in favour and would like to see more such institutes across the colony. Mr Ibbetson understood that the Government would assist in their establishment and support. He had also spoken to the Manager of the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. and the Secretary of the Adelaide Philosophical Institute. He thought it important to be in connection with a mother Institute, from which they might expect to receive papers to be read at the proposed institute. There were people in Burra who could deliver lectures, including lectures on scientific subjects. The proposal was to erect a room to hold 300 persons, with a dwelling of three rooms attached and that adult classes and singing classes should be formed. If they could raise £200 from the community and £200 from the two Companies they could then ask the Government for £400 to total £800.</p>
<p>Mr Genders seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Dr Mayne then moved: ‘That the whole sum required to erect and finish a suitable building (estimated at £800) is far beyond the power of any local efforts to raise, and this meeting therefore appeals respectfully and hopefully to the Government, to the South Australian Mining Association, and to the English and Australian Copper Company for their assistance and co-operation in the undertaking. Seconded by Mr Watts and carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner then moved the formation of a committee comprising Rev. Hillman, Rev. Ibbetson, Rev. Wilson, Rev. Wright and Messrs W.H. Challoner, J.W. Macdonald, L.J. Maurau, T.H. Mayne, A. Motley, Bath, Drew, Elphick, Genders, Johnson, Kimber, Mackay, Powell and Wood. Dr Maurau seconded the motion, which was carried without dissent.</p>
<p>Mr Woods then moved that to encourage subscribers those who contributed £10 or more should be given life membership and be free of the payments of any further subscriptions. Seconded by Mr Parker and carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Rev. Wright moved the appointment of W.H. Challoner and T.H. Mayne as auditors and of Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson as Secretary pro tem. Seconded by Mr Bath and carried unanimously. A subscription list was then opened and £90 was raised. Rev. Ibbetson then said that a precious occasion has raised £35.</p>

<p>Proposed Railway to the Murray. A letter to the Editor from Charles Simeon Hare.</p>
<p>[This is a very long letter and goes into a lot of detail on routes, construction and working costs, the source and security for capital and the consequences of the development for the colony as a whole and for Adelaide and Port Adelaide in particular.]</p>
<p>The general direction of the line. The most direct line would be through the Mt Lofty Ranges and thence to the thirty-nine sections. The second best would be via Gawler, Light’s Pass, Truro to North West Bend. The cost of the former option would be prohibitive due to the rugged country. The second line would also involve constructing a line through a gorge. The third and easiest/cheapest route would be to Gawler and thence via the Light Scrub to Nankervis’s public house and thence to Baldina, the Fingerpost to the Great Bend. There are no great physical obstacles on this route. The Burra Burra Mines could be reached via the east side of the ranges and the Mine traffic alone would justify the expenditure. Thus the one line could embrace the Burra and the Murray traffic.</p>
<p>Cost. The third option would be of 160 miles and should be at a cost of about £9,000 per mile or in all £1,215,000. Use of Barlow’s rails could reduce this to £1,134,000. [Hare goes on to consider the costs of rolling stock and suggests it should be made locally (except for the wheels).]</p>
<p>The Traffic. The best enquiries I have made suggest an annual 100,000 tons of traffic lies north, beyond the Light. The Burra Burra Mines and the Smelting Co. would supply much of this. The Smelting Works alone have a traffic in copper ore and coal of 20,000 tons per annum. There are at present 4,000 tons of coal at Port Wakefield awaiting cartage to Kooringa. The present cost of coal delivered at Burra is £7 per ton and this prevents poor ores from being handled. The mine and the Smelting Works would both undergo great development if the railway were built to the Murray. The railway would pass through the great scrub, which would provide timber traffic; it is only 24 miles from the Burra and the wood could be carried there at 3d per ton per mile. It could get to the furnaces for 9/- per ton. At three tons of wood to make the equivalent of one ton of coal, it would cost £1-10-0 compared with the cost of coals, varying from £4 to £7 per ton. Many poorer mines, like Karkulto could become viable if the railway were built. The other source of traffic of course the people at the diggings. I am informed there are some 300,000 there. I assume that 200,000 could be reached via this road, thence by water to Maiden’s Punt, and then by dray via Campaspie to Bendigo.</p>
<p>[He then goes into calculations to show that SA flour could be delivered to Bendigo at a delivery cost of £7-10-0 per ton. This he calculates would price SA flour in Bendigo at £25 per ton, which could not be matched by other sources. He goes on to calculate how much traffic this would be likely to generate. He passes lightly over the other traffic on the line from a variety of sources along the way and concludes it is a great investment and in his view well worth the risk involved in the massive borrowings to finance it.]</p>

<p>Kooringa News</p>
<p>A memorial signed by almost 80 of the respectable inhabitants of Burra was sent to the Governor asking him to establish a Court of Revision at Kooringa, in addition to the one already gazetted for Clare.

<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Co. have advices from their Manager to December 17. The smelters sent out from England in the Glentanner have arrived, and he was very much pleased with them generally. Three more furnaces had been lighted and a second refinery. The stock of ore was about 5,000 tons. About 200 tons have been shipped to England. The Lightning brings about 500 tons of ore. Cartage has fallen of as usual at Christmas. It would increase again in about six weeks’ time. The coal at the works was nearly 1,500 tons. The mules were all in first rate condition.</p>
<p>16 July 1856, page 2</p>
<p>Proposed Railway to the Murray. A letter to the Editor from Charles Simeon Hare.</p>
<p>[Hare continues with an extremely long letter in which he develops arguments for building the railway.</p>
<p>He begins with a long account of how the railway traffic will develop. He begins by introducing live animal traffic. He also envisages feeding a lot of surplus hay to cattle to establish a dairy industry, which will forward its produce to the Victorian diggings.</p>
<p>He then turns his attention to the line’s working expenses, which he estimates at £50,000 per anum.</p>
<p>On turning his attention to the security for the loans needed, he discusses the value of the colony’s lands and improvements. He concludes that the colony is worth some £15 million against which there will be a need to borrow £1.2 million.</p>
<p>The next item he addresses is the consequent developments in the colony as a result of this investment. He also discusses how Victoria will have very great rouble and expense in getting a railway to the goldfields because of the terrain to be traversed.]</p>
<p>Sandro writes concerning the search for gold in SA.</p>
<p>As it is intended to send out parties looking for a remunerative gold field, I would suggest the vicinity of the Burra Burra. Though I do not profess to be acquainted with the geology of that area, I do recall seeing, in about 1846, a person who had come from that area with some pieces of metal which I considered to be gold, as did the discoverer himself. The man was an experienced miner in South America. Unfortunately he died before he could return to the district and I am not aware that he communicated the location of the discovery to any relative. I knew the discoverer for many years and am confident he was telling the truth. The old saying that gold is not found in the vicinity of copper mines has been disproved by its discovery at the Victoria mine in this colony, which at first was worked for copper only.</p>
<p>18 July 1856, page 2</p>
<p>Land for the Railway</p>
<p>[Editorial] Some weeks ago we suggested that a railway would add so much value to properties along its route that owners should be willing to donate the land for its construction. Many thought we were foolish to believe that any owners would do so. But it seems many are so inclined and a memorial to the Governor signed by upwards of 100 landowners urges the construction of a line northwards from Gawler through the Gilbert Valley and thence to North-West Bend, with the undertaking to donate land for its construction. We have no doubt that landowners in other districts will follow the lead of these Saddleworth memorialists. For such landowners the gift of land is a move of commonsense and sound policy. ‘They are entitled to praise, not because they sacrifice their own interest, but because they are wise enough to see that in promoting a great public undertaking they are promoting their own individual advantage.’</p>

<p>Last Saturday a large crowd went to a spot on the Adelaide Road to witness a prize fight between Johnny Paull and Sydney Tom. After they had fought for some time Corporal Bolus and two troopers arrived. The Corporal immediately went into the ring and seized Johnny Paull, and gave him in charge to the troopers. Tom escaped.</p>

<p>Mrs Freeman was charged by her daughter Mrs Braithwaite with an assault and Mrs Braithwaite was charge by her mother Mrs Freeman with an assault. The evidence showed that Mrs Freeman had, with the authority of Mr Braithwaite, taken his child from its mother and that the mother had, in her excitement, broken Mrs Freeman’s windows to obtain possession of her child. This she accomplished, although it was again taken from her by Mrs Freeman. On this occasion Mrs Freeman spat on her daughter’s window and on another occasion threw a stone at her. The cases were dismissed upon Mrs Braithwaite promising not to annoy her mother in the future and Mrs Freeman making similar promises. The child was ordered to be given to the care of Mrs Freeman, as desired by Mr Braithwaite.</p>
<p>[Susan Freeman aged 17 had married John Braithwaite aged 27, in Adelaide, 25 November 1852. Her daughter, Susan, was born in Adelaide 5 September 1853. She grew up and married Ephraim George Dorling 15 November 1877. John Braithwaite died 1 December 1872 at Blinman aged 48. His wife does not appear in SA Births, Marriages &amp; Deaths records after the birth of Susan.]</p>

<p>The Primitive Methodist Church was reopened last Sunday. Three sermons were preached by Rev. J.D. Whittaker of Adelaide. Collections totalled £27. On Monday more than 600 attended a tea-meeting. Captain William Michael chaired the public meeting. The profits of the tea-meeting were £32-13-4 and collections at the public meeting raised £10. Total expenditure had been £502-5-81⁄2 and income was £362-6-31⁄2, leaving a debt of £139-19-5 on the chapel. The chapel has a neat appearance and will seat 300. Captain Roach has presented a magnificent Bible to the chapel.</p>
<p>Gardens in Kooringa. Some fine vegetables have been cut from Mr Varcoe’s garden, including some broccoli weighing from 10-12 lb. On Saturday some fine cauliflowers were sent into the township from Captain Isaac Killicoat’s garden. He has a garden of 13 acres at Abberton Park. One of the cauliflowers weighed 42 lb and was 51 inches high with the diameter of the flower 13 inches. The diameter of the top leaves was 40 inches and of the stalk 11 inches. The survey for the railway from the Burra to the Murray runs through the garden.</p>

<p>An elderly man named Thomas Thomas, bent nearly double, has been soliciting alms from door to door. He has been presenting a petition signed by John Bowden JP, setting out his misfortunes as a way to open the hearts and pockets of the community. On Wednesday evening he was found drunk and taken into custody. The police found the petition and also some papers he had left at the Burra Hotel. One paper was an agreement between Thomas Thomas and another to divide a certain section between them. Another was a bill or acceptance worth £29, in favour of Thomas Thomas and nearly due. A third stated the brands and descriptions of his (Thomas Thomas’s) cattle. The public can make their own judgement, but he is at present lodged in Perry’s Hotel, alias the Redruth Gaol.</p>
<p>Port Wakefield Road</p>
<p>A letter from J. Hamilton, Manager of the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. stated he had anticipated the decision of the Road Board and had employed several working parties on the Port Wakefield Road. As the sum of £1,750 was altogether inadequate, he was disposed to double that amount, if he could obtain from the Government a promise to reimburse the Company at some time.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Miners’ &amp; Mechanics’ Institute</p>
<p>Mr Challoner chaired a meeting at the Burra Hotel last Friday. The committee reported that since the last meeting the collectors had raised £200, apart from what they could expect from the Mining Company and the Copper Company. The SA Mining Association had promised £200 plus £50 towards the library and £20 for the first year of operation. The Copper Company had promised £50 when the foundation stone was laid and £50 when it was ready for roofing, £25 towards book and when it had been established one year, an annual subscription. The Government had promised one third of the amount for a suitable building and Captain Allen £25. They proposed erecting a building to seat 100, with necessary accommodation for the librarian and would be so arranged as to allow easy expansion in the future. The SA Mining Association had granted a lease for 99 years at a peppercorn rent. The Secretary had been authorised to write to England for some suitable books and periodicals, which he had done.</p>
<p>It was then resolved to form a Working Man’s Committee to facilitate the communication of the views of the working classes to the committee. This was initially to comprise Messrs William Turpin, Charles Fellows, James Skewes, Christopher Dent, and Daniel Ryan with the power to increase their number to 12.</p>
<p>(Moved Mr Maurau &amp; seconded Mr Joseph Woods.)</p>
<p>It was also resolved that in the event of the Governor paying a visit to the township he be asked to lay the foundation stone, since he had been instrumental in calling it into being. (Moved Dr Mayne &amp; seconded Mr McNamara.)</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson moved that the subscription be £1 with a 5/- entrance fee; the latter to be waived if the person had already contributed a like sum to the building fund. Seconded Mr Thomas Bath.</p>
<p>Rev. Wright then moved that the plan shown that evening be adopted and forthwith proceeded with.</p>
<p>He had no doubt they would receive plenty of assistance from the working classes.</p>
<p>‘They had a good thing in hand and it must go on. The great object of their anticipated Institute was the moral advancement of all. It was for the good of the poor man; it would tend greatly to raise men in the scale of usefulness.’ (Seconded by Rev. Hillman.)</p>
<p>Opening of the Bridge at Kapunda</p>
<p>On Tuesday 23 September the bridge was opened to the public. The contractor was Messrs Baker. The first loads over it were two bullock drays loaded with cake copper, weighing upwards of four tons each. The German Brass band arrived shortly afterwards in one of Mr Burton’s carriages. [Further details are given.]</p>

<p>Burra Burra Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute</p>
<p>[Editorial comment. The writer goes on at some considerable length extolling the virtues of intellectual enjoyment and praising communities and individual philanthropists who foster the encouragement of learning and the pursuit of reflective and abstract thought etc. etc.]</p>
<p>‘In communities like our, then, the establishment of a Mechanics’ Institution is a token of improved pecuniary circumstances, affording leisure for the cultivation of higher tastes and means of gratifying them. We may, therefore, fairly take the opportunity of congratulating the good people of Kooringa on the reviving commercial prosperity and general improvement in circumstances evidenced by the successful efforts they have just been making to lay the foundations of a Mechanics’ and Miners’ Institution at the Burra.’</p>
<p>‘We rejoice to know that they now have the means of mental improvement; but we rejoice still more to know that they have not lost the inclination to use them.’</p>
<p>Many such societies have failed because the management has been confined to a particular class.</p>
<p>‘While they have ostensibly been working men’s societies, they have really been managed by the leisured classes, maintained by them, and have ultimately become evening lounges for their exclusive use. This evil is judiciously guarded against by the projectors of the Burra Institute; who in addition to the Committee of General Management, have now formed a Working Men’s Committee, specially entrusted with the function of representing the views and wishes of the working classes, for whose benefit the Institute is chiefly designed.’</p>
<p>[The writer then goes on to develop the idea that this is a highly desirable innovation.]</p>
<p>The liberal support promised to the infant institution by the great companies of the district is very pleasing.</p>
<p>This follows the example set in the mining districts of England. ‘There the wealthy mining proprietors have long been eminent as the foremost in promoting and endowing all local institutions designed to ameliorate the physical condition or assist the mental advancement of the people from whose labour, in combination with their own capital, skill, and experience, they derive their wealth.’</p>

<p>The Burra Mines</p>
<p>The half-yearly meting of the Burra Company was held yesterday. We have much pleasure in calling attention to the favourable account given of the different workings of these celebrated mines.</p>
<p>In the last six months 5,600 tons or ore have been raised. There was also 4,440 tons on hand, which had been raised at the date of the previous half-yearly meeting. In the half-year 3,813 tons of ore had been exported for sale and delivered to the Smelting Co. There are 6,068 tons of ore on hand. Ore sold in the past half-year is supposed to average 24%. Captain Roach’s report suggests that not only is it likely the present workings will be continued, but also that new lodes of valuable ore will be found. The various pitches seem without exception to be yielding good quantities of ore and the application of new machinery will further increase productiveness.</p>
<p>758 persons are now directly employed at the Burra Mines, of whom 385 are miners, 200 are ore dressers, 113 are labourers, 47 are mechanics and engine drivers and 13 are officers. These figures exclude those employed at the new Karkulto Mine. The Directors lament the fall of £18-10-0 per ton in the price of copper on the English market. This will affect not only the ore on hand in SA, but also that held by London agents an at sea. This sudden decline has led the Directors to say that in all probability they will not be able to pay a dividend on 1 December. This said, it is well to recall that the price of copper at £107-10-0 per ton was exceedingly high and a decline should not come as a surprise. The increasing productiveness of the mine partially offsets this loss. Despite the fall in copper prices the undistributed profits are £62,000.</p>

<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Company</p>
<p>The AGM of the proprietors was held at the London Tavern on Monday 21 July with Sir William Foster, Bart. in the chair. The Chairman said the meeting was called in accordance with the deed of settlement, but as Mr Hamilton had not taken stock at the end of December, they could not present the accounts. He considered Mr Hamilton had been wise not to suspend operations at the busiest time of the year and they hoped to receive the accounts in five or six weeks. He proposed to adjourn the meeting for two months. The Directors had made the best report they could. It should satisfy the shareholders to know that Mr Hamilton had sent money (and material) sufficient to pay off all the debentures, and to leave a balance in hand.</p>
<p>Mr Jennings said he understood that the sale of the Spitty Works would have paid off the debenture debt.</p>
<p>Mr Schneider reminded shareholders that the liabilities were upwards of £50,000, independent of the debentures.</p>
<p>The Directors’ Report</p>
<p>Without encouraging unreasonable expectations, it is reasonable to expect material improvements in the ensuing season. The great problem has been the lack of labour following the gold discoveries. This could neither have been foreseen nor guarded against. The effect was to completely paralyse activity. At first all operations were suspended and then when resumed, they were of necessity on a very limited scale. The necessity, under the terms of the contract, of delivering all copper made to the SA Mining Association, left the company’s share exiting only in ore that they were unable to smelt at the company’s works. This has resulted in a heavy drawback on the company’s finances, but when these evils are overcome a very different state of affairs can be anticipated.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton’s reports not say that the smelting works have been restored to activity. Labour has again become plentiful as the attraction of the goldfields has reduced. The smelters sent out by the directors have arrived; supplies of coal have arrived, as have the wagons to make the mules serviceable.</p>
<p>From March 1855 to February 1856 the copper smelted was 1,395 tons 5 cwt 2 qr 10 lb</p>
<p>The ore consumed was 4,792 tons 12 cwt.</p>
<p>In the previous year the copper smelted was 511 tons.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton reports he will undertake to take stock at the works in April. Until this report is received the Directors cannot present a complete balance sheet of the company’s affairs.</p>
<p>The produce of the Spitty Works, the sale of which was agreed upon at the last general meeting, has enabled the company to meet all the company’s engagements in England.</p>
<p>Ore and copper coming from Mr Hamilton will leave a surplus in the hands of the company.</p>
<p>From February 1855 to February 1856 the SA Mining Association has delivered to the works 8,853 tons 3 cwt 1 qr of ore. Copper shipped from Adelaide to London has been 350 tons 7 cwt 2 qr 23 lb. Ore shipped to England has been 3,924 tons.</p>
<p>The sum total at the present time amounted to £17,000 and out of that they intended to pay off the debentures of £13,000. But for the great fall in copper prices they would have had £25,000 in hand instead of £17,000.</p>
<p>On advice from Mr Hamilton the Directors expected to have about £25,000 cash in hand by the end of September.</p>
<p>When the accounts were made up it was proposed five or six shareholders should be selected to confer with the Directors on the question of a new contract with the SA Mining Association and on the division of the money in hand.</p>
<p>Mr Schneider said as there were no accounts at hand they should not adopt the report.</p>
<p>Mr Sutton said he had a large stake in the company, which had been for years in active operation without delivering a dividend. He proposed a committee be established to watch the interests of the company. The Chairman said this would be a slur on the Directors and he would not entertain the motion. After discussion, it was withdrawn.</p>

<p>SA Census and Population</p>
<p>Census returns for 31 March 1855.</p>
<p>632 persons were estimated travelling or omitted for a total population of 85,821 on 31 March 1855.</p>
<p>Houses</p>
<p>Stone or brick 9,101</p>
<p>Wood 6,709</p>
<p>Other 3,087</p>
<p>There are 5,321 farmers and 5,105 agricultural labourers. In many districts there are more masters than servants.</p>
<p>Religion</p>
<p>The numbers of the Church of England are acknowledged by the clergy to be merely nominal.</p>
<p>The large number of Lutherans is due to the large admixture of the German element. In County Light for example there are 1,723 Lutherans in a population of 5,167. A number of other districts are similar.</p>
<p>From June 1855 to December 1856:</p>
<p>17,688 males arrived and 5,537 departed.</p>
<p>10,399 females arrived and 2,949 departed.</p>
<p>But note that records of departures are defective. Recorded figures suggest the SA population is now 105,322, but it is thought to be in the range 90,000 to 92,000. One reason (among several) is that in the first two quarters of 1856 some 5,000 Chinese arrived on their way to Victoria, but their departures have not been recorded.</p>
<p>[The lengthy report then goes on to detail the demographic and social characteristics of the immigrants; their origins, literacy, occupations, etc. Details of the Government migrant ships are given. Of some interest is the length of the voyages, which ranged from 79 days to 132 days, with an average of 981⁄2. The costs of getting these people to the colony are also discussed.]</p>

<p>Burra Political Meeting</p>
<p>A meeting at the Burra Burra Hotel on Monday drew between 200 and 300 electors to hear Mr Morris Marks explain his political views. William Young was called to the chair.</p>
<p>Mr Marks said he was responding to a numerously-signed requisition from Clare and Burra people. He was a man for public rights. He was Liberal in principle, would promise nothing, but would do his best to promote their interests. He was concerned that large sums of money had been expended in getting migrants to come to SA, when it was known their real destination was the eastern colonies. Many stayed only a few days in SA before starting for Melbourne or Sydney so that SA had all the expense, but none of the benefit. He felt that the system of selling crown lands required change to enable the poor man to obtain land without paying an exorbitant price. Taxes should rise for those holding vast stretches of land that were uncultivated and unimproved. The farmers should pay less tax. Education was important and teachers should be paid more. He favoured the construction of railways as a means of developing the agriculture of the colony, which was being held back by the high cost of transportation. The roads south of Adelaide had been maintained, but those north of Gawler had been totally neglected. Even if this was not a great agricultural area, it was a great wool growing and mining district and if the mines failed it would severely affect the whole colony. He favoured distilleries. He advocated a simpler land transfer system. He favoured free trade. Mr Woollacott proposed Mr Marks as a fit and proper person to represent the District of Burra and Clare. A show of hands resulted in ten for and one against the proposal.</p>
<p>5 January 1857, page 3</p>
<p>Political Meeting at Greenock Creek</p>
<p>[Though not a Burra meeting, this is significant in mentioning a number of the changes that were brought about by the new Constitution for SA in 1856. This introduced a bicameral system of Parliament, with universal male suffrage in the lower house and a property qualification in the Legislative Council. It marked the end of nominated members and stipulated that all money bills had to originate in the lower house. The Governor would no longer be able to authorise expenditure of money or make appointments or dismissals unless they were countersigned by the Chief Secretary.]</p>
<p>The meeting last Saturday was chaired by Mr Nock and with many of the 60-70 present being Germans, Mr Kruger acted as interpreter. Mr Bagot addressed the meeting as a candidate for Parliament.</p>
<p>He pointed to some of the constitutional changes and their possible results in terms of policy:</p>
<p>Adult male suffrage with a six months residency requirement had given the vote to the German residents for the first time.</p>
<p>Parliament had gained control of the Land Fund. [That is money raised from the sale of Crown Land.]</p>
<p>This change should result a fairer distribution of expenditure on roads; the northern roads had been shamefully neglected in the past.</p>
<p>The Governor would no longer be able to spend huge sums on his own pet projects; as in the case of the Port Elliot breakwater, for example.</p>
<p>Men born in a foreign country were no longer excluded from election to Parliament.</p>
<p>Roads and railways north of Adelaide would receive more attention.</p>
<p>More would be done for general education.</p>

<p>The Smelting of Iron (Editorial)</p>
<p>SA possesses rich deposits of iron, but hitherto the cost of labour has made its exploitation uneconomic. Now the newly invented process of Mr Bessemer seems likely to so reduce costs as to make iron production here feasible. Indeed it is somewhat surprising that no steps have so far been taken to ascertain whether this is the case.</p>
<p>Mr M. MacDermott has written to the Chief Secretary, suggesting a Commission be set up to investigate the possibility and desirability of establishing an iron smelting facility in SA. [The text of the letter is printed. It outlines the case at some length.]</p>
<p>The Under-Secretary has replied that, while the establishment of such a Commission is an interesting idea and will meet with due consideration, it is something that requires parliamentary approval and the voting of funds.</p>
<p>[The editor said he believes that it will doubtless be one item to engage the early attention of the new Parliament.]</p>

<p>Burra Burra Miners’ &amp; Mechanic’s Institute</p>
<p>The foundation stone was laid on Thursday afternoon (26 February) by Special Magistrate Mr J.W. Macdonald in the presence of about 200 tradesmen and others. Mr Macdonald, in a few words, showed the advantages of such an institution and the necessity for all classes to combine to reap the benefits and the greater the number assisted, the greater would be the benefit to each individually. Rev. Matthew Wilson offered a prayer to the Institute’s success. In the evening there was a tea and speech making.</p>

<p>Coal is reported to have been discovered in the Murray Scrub between Burra and the river.</p>
<p>Alleged Coal Discovery</p>
<p>Captain Freeling has returned from investigating the coal discovered near Apoinga. He confirms that the substance is indeed coal, but believes its origin was a portion of coal thrown from drays, which in former times used the track near where the discovery was made. Water and drift, he believes, had buried the coal, which has now been uncovered.</p>

<p>Brutal Assault at Kooringa</p>
<p>On Saturday night two women were assaulted by two men as they walked past the Miners’ and Mechanic’s Institute, now in the course of construction. It began with some larking around and overtures from the men, but when these were rejected, one of the women was roughly handled. In seeking to save herself from falling down, she clutched at the man and scratched his face. He then picked up a rock and threatened to knock her skull in. He threw the stone, which broke her arm. After she fell to the ground she was unmercifully kicked and left to her fate. To make matters worse the woman was pregnant. Both men are known and will undoubtedly appear in court when the woman is sufficiently recovered to attend.</p>
<p>Burra Miners’ &amp; Mechanics’ Institute is progressing and when finished will be a handsome building. All materials used are of the first quality. It is to be hoped that when it is opened, all who can, will avail themselves of the many benefits to be derived.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>The 12th Annual Report of the Directors of the SA Mining Association has been published. It is a cheering document with no indication that one of our greatest industries is showing any signs of decreasing. The company’s prospects are brighter now than they were six months ago. The price of copper in England has recovered to its position before the recent fall and even exceeded that point. New and valuable lodes of ore have been discovered to be exploited simultaneously with this increased price of copper. The Directors are so confident that they will pay on 3 June and again on 2 September next a dividend of 100%. This they expect to do even if the copper price falls again, but there is no indication that is likely.</p>
<p>In the past six months 5,360 tons of ore were raised. The average copper content was 24%. Ore raised in the 12 months to 31 March was 10,450 tons. The cost of raising it was £90,719 gross, or £8-13-8 per ton. The amount realised was £186,278 gross or £17-6-6 per ton. The total profit was £95,558, or £9-2-10 per ton. To the total profits must be added £2,292 for rents etc. for an aggregate profit of £97,851. The last three dividends have been paid from this and an outstanding balance, leaving the account £64,534 in credit. When the produce now available is sold it is likely there will be an additional sum of £37,242 to be added to this, making a total profit of £102,776.</p>
<p>The Burra Company is now employing 708 persons. Of these 693 are working at the Mines, 10 are at Karkulto and 5 in Adelaide.</p>
<p>In the place of the late Captain Allen Mr Thomas Graves has been appointed a Director and in lieu of Mr A. Jaffrey, who has left SA, Mr John Hector has been appointed. Otherwise the group remains unchanged; the five retiring Directors all having been re-elected.</p>

<p>Port Wakefield Facilities</p>
<p>A large public meeting of influential people was held at the Stanley Arms at Watervale on 25 March. The meeting was concerned with improving Port Wakefield as a place for exporting SA’s produce. A petition had been prepared for Parliament. Mr Horrocks read the petition and then addressed the meeting.</p>
<p>Exports from the port in the last fifteen months have been:</p>
<p>Copper Ore £220,000</p>
<p>Wool £106,000</p>
<p>And a large quantity of flour and wheat.</p>
<p>Imports £49,000</p>
<p>Since it was established not more than £2,000 has been expended in improvements and now a number of producers are considering sending their produce by road, despite the higher cartage costs; so difficult is the loading of vessels at Port Wakefield.</p>
<p>Barges cannot reach vessels lying outside, except in very high or spring tides and there is grossly inadequate wharfage accommodation. The creek is inconveniently narrow. It needs to be widened and the wharf extended to enable more and large barges to be loaded.</p>
<p>The memorialists sought for £20,000 to be included in the estimates for the harbour improvements.</p>
<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Co. has repeatedly appealed to the Legislature for aid, but without effect.</p>
<p>If Port Wakefield were to be made a port of easy shipment the wealth of Burra and the surrounding district would be exported from it for many years. The improvement of Port Wakefield would be a more substantial benefit than the expenditure of £500,000 on the extension of the Gawler railway.</p>
<p>Land sales around Port Wakefield have contributed £120,000 to the Treasury and yet little of that has found its way back to improve this part of the country.</p>
<p>Mr Lennon also spoke. He asked that the bar be deepened, the silt removed and all obstructions done away with to make the harbour one of safety and easy entrance for ships of large tonnage.</p>
<p>He pointed out that their own interest in the port was enduring because they were of the district, while the interests of the Directors of the SA Mining Association and the E &amp; A Copper Company were of a fleeting nature and they would soon shift to an alternative route if it paid them better. If those in the Port Wakefield area wanted development and growth based on the copper trade they needed to see action on the port now. A united approach to Parliament was needed.</p>
<p>The petition already carries over 300 signatures.</p>

<p>Flood at Burra</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon 25 April a number of persons were standing outside Barker’s Hotel [The Burra Burra Hotel] when they saw a large volume of water rushing from the west towards the hotel. Within a few moments half of Mr Barker’s garden was under water. People were dashing about, getting children and anything that might be swept away out of the dry bed of the creek. In less than a quarter of an hour the water level had risen so that the main street was one continuous torrent. One or two houses were flooded to a depth of about one foot. The bridge between Commercial Street and the Post Office, comprising three large and heavy logs, was completely swept away, together with some fencing and stonework. It was fortunate that the event occurred in daylight, or more damage would have been done. As it was prompt action was taken to keep water out of cellars etc. Interestingly Burra had been quite dry and although it had rained heavily within a mile or two, the town had experienced only one very slight shower.</p>

<p>Port Wakefield Public Meeting</p>
<p>A public meeting on 25 April at the Rising Sun Hotel in Port Wakefield resolved that a preliminary survey should be held on such parts of the bends of the River Wakefield and the channel outside the embouchure to the same, as it might be deemed necessary to remove for the improvement of the harbour and that a rough plan be drawn showing the extent of the improvement required, together with the most eligible site for a public wharf. It was resolved that this plan accompany the petition being prepared for submission to the SA Parliament as discussed at the meeting at Watervale on 25 March.</p>

<p>Extension of the Gawler Railway</p>
<p>The Surveyor General has produced a report on estimates and traffic returns on a proposed railway Gawler to Kapunda and Kapunda to Blanchetown.</p>
<p>Four lines for northern extension railways have been considered:</p>
<p>The Wakefield Route: to Pinkerton’s Flat, the River Light, by that river to Salter’s Creek, the River Wakefield to auburn, Mintaro and the head of Gum Creek to Burra.</p>
<p>The Gilbert Route, as above to the Light, by Ayliffe’s, Forrester’s and Saddleworth, to the headwaters of the Gilbert, by the large lagoon and the head of Gum Creek to Burra.</p>
<p>Kapunda Route: to Kapunda, Ross’s Creek, the head of Allen’s Creek, Hamilton, up the Dirty Light and Tothill’s Creek, Logan’s Flat and the Burra Creek to Burra.</p>
<p>Taking option 3 to Tothill’s Creek and then via the head of the Dirty Light to the large Lagoon to Burra.</p>
<p>For the Murray Extension:</p>
<p>From Burra by Baldina Creek to North West Bend.</p>
<p>From the River Light southwest of Kapunda by St Kitt’s Creek and Camp Creek to Blanchetown.</p>
<p>From Gawler by Greenock Creek, Angus Park and Truro to Moorundee.</p>
<p>From Gawler to Sandy Creek, towards Tanunda.</p>
<p>From Adelaide by the Torrens, One Tree Hill Creek and the Thirty-nine Sections.</p>
<p>The route recommended is a combination of the Kapunda and Gilbert routes. It passes close to the Kapunda mining district and the Karkulto mining property. It is easily reached for most of its length by good natural roads and could be extended north of Burra for perhaps 120 miles without difficulty. Agricultural land lies on either side of it.</p>
<p>Option 2 is the recommended one for the Murray extension. It would pass through one of the finest agricultural districts in the colony. [Captain Freeling says he considers the choices made by the engineers Messrs Harvey &amp; Murray are very good after he had looked at the options himself and looked at a numbering of levelling reports.]</p>
<p>Mr Hanson’s estimate that the extension to Kapunda would yield 41⁄2% is conservative.</p>
<p>A line to Kapunda would capture the Burra traffic and this in turn would mean that the need for a main line of road from Burra to Port Wakefield would cease to exist. Some £2,348 has already been expended on this 55 mile route. It is also proposed to spend £1,750 in 1857 just to get around some crossing places. As the land along this road gets sold and fenced, the road across the Wakefield Plains will probably become impassable in winter unless metalled. The cost would be very high and would be saved by the railway to Kapunda. This railway would also save on the roads north of Gawler to Clare and to Burra. The first ten miles north of Gawler are particularly difficult, with reactive soils and the need to bring in stone from a distance.</p>
<p>[Estimates of traffic on the line are then printed and the total is estimated at 20,000 tons.]</p>

<p>The Bon Accord Mine</p>
<p>The last mail from England advises that a Joint-Stock Company, which had been formed for the purpose, has purchased the Bon Accord property. The directors comprise some of the most influential names among the Australian residents in London and include Mr A.L. Elder. The capital is £75,000 in £1 shares; the liability of shareholders to be limited to the amount of subscription. A sum of 10/- is payable on the allotment of the shares with a further 10/- that may be called up six months later. The prospectus indicates that the company intends to thoroughly explore and develop the mineral lands. The high price of copper and the location of the site adjacent to the Burra Burra Mine present excellent grounds for the expectation of a successful result. We do not know if any shares have been reserved for allocation in the colonies.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held at the local court house on 29 May on the body of Robert Patterson before J.W. Macdonald, Special Magistrate.</p>
<p>Dr Mayne said that he had been called to see deceased on 29 May at Nankivell’s, but on the way met someone bringing him back in a cart. He was dead. He had an extensive wound under the left war and one under the chin on the right side. Both might have been inflicted by the hoof of a shod horse. He was bleeding from the nose and ears and I concluded he had a fractured skull, which I believe to have been the cause of death. He had a similar accident about nine months ago. My impression is he fell from the horse. A kick would not have made him bleed from the nose and ears.</p>
<p>George Brant said: the deceased came to me on the Teatree Flat. He brought the Mine horses up the Gulf Road. I am employed at the Mine. We went to Fry’s to have a drink. Afterwards we both went towards the road. I was ahead and he made his horse go fast to catch up. His horse came to a bit of a pit and he fell off. He held the bridle and the horse dragged him about six feet. I saw blood coming out of his ears. I stopped about five minutes to see if he breathed. [He then describes getting help and a cart etc. and the generally quiet nature of the horse when not teased. Alice Fry then gave largely corroborative evidence.]</p>
<p>Alice Fry said: the horse was much too strong for the boy.</p>
<p>Thomas Bentley said he knew the horse and it was a quiet one. He had ridden it himself and regularly worked in the whim. [Bentley said he was employed in the Company stables.]</p>
<p>The verdict was accidental death caused by a fall from a horse.</p>
<p>[This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD.]</p>

<p>Kooringa Post Office</p>
<p>There is some talk of a public meeting to call for a new post office. There is no place in the colony more in need of a safe post office. No one can now safely deposit items at the post office. Any person so inclined could easily break in and take such items when the postmaster is absent.</p>
<p>The Bible Christian Sunday School held its Anniversary services last Sunday. Sermons were preached morning and evening by the Rev. Thomas Hillman and in the afternoon by Rev. J.G. Wright. On Monday 125 of the children and their teachers, headed by a band, marched through the streets of the township with their gay banners. They ended up at the chapel, where they had a sumptuous tea. A public tea followed at which some 350 sat down. The public meeting followed at which it was reported that the school had 140 pupils and 34 teachers. The nett proceeds of the Anniversary were £52-2-8, which added to £24-4-10 in the hands of the Treasurer, made a total of £76-7-6. About 450 attended the meeting. The Sunday school library comprises 339 volumes.</p>

<p>Kapunda Railway</p>
<p>The Chief Secretary has moved in Parliament for a Select Committee to report on the plans, estimates and probable traffic of the Gawler-Kapunda railway line. He said it was Government policy to extend the means of communication in the colony and they had decided on extending the Gawler railway to Kapunda. They had in mind serving the Burra Burra Mine and opening up agricultural land in the north. Although there were plans for extensions to Burra and the Murray, it was not at present intended to go beyond Kapunda. The manager of the Copper Co. assured them that when the line reached Gawler their traffic would be diverted from the Gulf Road. This traffic of 25,000 tons would soon wear out a main line of common road and north of Gawler the Bay of Biscay soil would greatly increase the costs of road construction. Time was money and this applied to the farmer seeking to get his produce to market regardless of the season and also to the labourer going for a job.</p>
<p>[The Chief Secretary gives a lengthy speech in which he outlines the benefits of railways generally and of the Kapunda line in particular. He goes into costs and profits. For example he cites figures to show that a railway line from Port Adelaide to Burra, of 105 miles, could be run at a profit on the basis of the Copper Company’s traffic alone. He also speaks of tramways and dismisses them as not cost effective.]</p>

<p>Kooringa Post Office</p>
<p>An anonymous correspondent writes calling the attention of authorities to the need for a new post office at Kooringa. The present building is a wooden structure 12 ft x 16 ft and 7 ft high. At a conservative estimate an amount greater than £100,000 is place there in one year by storekeepers for transmission to Adelaide. Most of this has to be posted overnight and during the absence of the postmaster (a single man) ten minutes would suffice to enter the building and make a clearance, with little chance of detection.</p>

<p>Coal</p>
<p>[An article from the Sydney Morning Herald discussed the position of the NSW coal trade. While Victoria and SA have not found any coal resources, there are coal fields in Tasmania, which, if developed, could provide competition for NSW coal. Still the article is optimistic that NSW can answer any competition and retain its position as the leading supplier of coal. Of interest to Burra was the statement:</p>
<p>‘Next to Victoria, South Australia is our best customer for coal. The smelting works at the Burra Burra copper mine use up a large quantity, and when the projected Northern Railway is completed so as to make carriage cheaper, it will be worth while to smelt the inferior ores, and a greatly increased demand for fuel will then ensue.’]</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held before Dr Mayne at the Pig &amp; Whistle last Wednesday on the body of Henry Knevitt.</p>
<p>Joseph Knevitt, father of the deceased – Last saw him about midday Monday when I sent him with two horses to Mt Misery about two miles from Burra, where he was to hobble them and let them go. He did not come home. On Tuesday at about 7 o’clock I and my eldest son went in search of him. We found the horses about where we expected, but no sign of the deceased. Thinking he had gone to Burra for shelter we returned about midday. I had a cup of tea and went out directly. Sent my eldest son to inform the police. Caught one of the horses and rode as far as the Sugar Loaf before returning to a section I thought I had missed. Found the body about two yards from a stump. Went in to tell the police I had found him and hired a cart to bring him in. He was about 500 or 600 yards from the hobbled horses. He was aged 9 and sometimes stayed out till 9 o’clock, but never overnight. He was healthy and not subject to fits.</p>
<p>We expected him back about dusk and when he did not appear we were alarmed. His mother, brother and sister went in search of him, but did not find him. I thought he might have gone to Harris’s and was safe. My wife returned about 9 o’clock. It did not occur to us it was necessary to look for him or to give the alarm. He was sent because I and my eldest son went to grind two axes.</p>
<p>[P.T. O’Brien gave evidence of being there when the body was recovered. He thought it likely the boy had sought shelter at the stump. There were no signs of a struggle.]</p>
<p>William Knevitt gave evidence corroborating his father’s account. Though it was fine when the boy went out, the night had been very wet, windy and cold.]</p>
<p>Dr L.J. Maurau gave evidence of examining the body of a healthy child in good condition. There were no marks of injury or violence. A slight graze on the nose and forehead appear to have occurred about the time of death, probably by the body falling gently on some grit. Mostly likely he sat down at the stump, cramped with cold. On making an effort to move, he seems to have dropped dead from palsy of the heart’s action. Believe he died instantly. Two or three hours’ exposure on such a cold night would be sufficient to cause death in such a young child.</p>
<p>The verdict was death due to exposure to intense cold. The jury added: ‘The jury are of the opinion that that cannot too highly censure the conduct of the father; and that he displayed a great want of parental affection in not instituting an earlier search; and judging from the evidence adduced, believe that, had a proper search been made on the same evening, the child would have been found alive.’</p>

<p>SA Mining</p>
<p>Now that the disorganisation caused by the Victorian gold rush has largely settled attention can be given to the mineral resources of SA. [The editor then sets about a review of the major mines in SA.]</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines</p>
<p>Since the 11th Annual Report, published in our columns of 16 April, several important discoveries have been made in the southern and south-western workings:</p>
<p>A fine lode of malachite at the 45 fathom level in Ayers’ No. 1 shaft</p>
<p>A bunch or lode of malachite and red oxide between Peacock’s air-shaft and Waterhouse’s Shaft, upwards of 30 fathoms in length and 16-18 feet in breadth.</p>
<p>In exploring the depths at 60 fathoms or more the miners have to contend with a great influx of water. In some of the workings operations have to be suspended until the springs can be drained. The present powerful steam pump with an 80 inch cylinder is proving inadequate in keeping the water ‘in fork’. Consequently the Directors have lately ordered from England another large pumping engine, similar in power to the present one, together with a considerable supply of powerful pit-work. This machinery is expected to arrive in summer.</p>
<p>Kooringa Smelting Works</p>
<p>For the 12 months to 30 June the works smelted 2,000 tons of copper, worth in England, according to the latest advices, £252,000.</p>
<p>Karkulto Mine</p>
<p>The engine house is nearly completed and applications have already been received to work pitches here on tribute.</p>

<p>There has been heavy rain in the last fortnight. The grass is green and growing. The main street is in an extremely dirty state.

<p>Bon Accord Mining Co.</p>
<p>The shares in this company have just been allotted, despite the tightness in the money market. A change has been made in the method of payment by which the company will acquire the property. The price originally agreed upon by the joint owners: The Scottish Australian Investment and North British Australasian Companies, was £24,000 cash and a royalty of one twentieth of all ore to be raised. It has now been agreed that, subject to the agreement of the proprietaries of the two old companies, that the prices shall be £18,000 and 12,000 shares with 10/- per share paid up, in the Bon Accord Copper Mining Company, together with the one-twentieth royalty. In this way the Scottish Australian Investment Company will receive £12,000 cash and 8,000 shares and the North British Australasian Company will receive £6,000 cash and 4,000 shares, together with their share of the one twentieth royalty. We understand the remaining 75,000 shares, of which the capital of the Company consists, are held by an excellent proprietary of between 600 and 700 shareholders. Should the continuation of the Burra Burra ores be found without much difficulty this arrangement should be most favourable to both the old companies and the new one that has undertaken its development. The proprietors of the Scottish Australian Investment Company have decided to accept this proposed arrangement.</p>
<p>The Scottish Australian Investment Company</p>
<p>[This is a very long report on a special general meeting of the company, held in London and reported in the Mining Journal of 25 April.]</p>
<p>[A few points of interest from this long report:</p>
<p>62,250 shares in the new Bon Accord Mining Co. were taken up by the public. The Scottish Australian Investment Company was allocated 8,000 and the North British Australasian Company got 4,000 under the arrangement for the sale of the Bon Accord property. This, when 500 were allocated to the Manager in Australia and 250 to the Sub-manager, accounted for all the 75,000 shares.</p>
<p>The Chairman quotes a letter from un-named Australians who had been negotiating to lease the unsold portion of the Bon Accord property with the intention to develop the mine. They say that they have watched the whole operation of the mine and are confident that they have a better idea of where the lode will lie. They were negotiating with Mr Morehead of Sydney and briefly with Mr Elder of Adelaide before returning to Mr Moorhead. They concluded that no one in Australia had the authority to lease them the property and so they were turning to the principals in the UK.</p>
<p>The Chairman also quotes a letter of July 1856 in which there is mention of a discovery of a lode of malachite in the 40 fathom level of the Burra Burra Mine, which passes right into the Bon Accord property. This gives great encouragement to the prospects of the Bon Accord Mine.</p>
<p>The Chairman then proposed acceptance of the arrangements outlined in the previous article.</p>
<p>There was some dissent with one shareholder arguing for a leasing arrangement and another wanting the shares being allotted to them to be fully paid rather than paid to 10/-. This shareholder (Mr Ward) also asked if there was any truth to a report that Burra Burra miners had crossed the line into Bon Accord property in their operations.</p>
<p>J.N. Smith, a Director, pointed out that the cost on their books of the Bon Accord was between £8,000 and £9,000 and they were going to get £12,000 and 8,000 shares paid to 10/- and a royalty. They could not lose on the deal.</p>
<p>The proposition to accept the offer was carried with applause, with two dissentients.</p>

<p>Corporal G.R .Lowe said that he had received information that Tootell had sold a fill that did not belong to him.</p>
<p>Police Trooper Holloway told how he had arrested the accused at Kapunda and brought him back.</p>
<p>Tootell had told him that the mare belonged to Charles Bennett and that he had an authority from Mr Morley (Mr Chamber’s overseer) to sell her if she took bad on the road. She did take bad and so he sold her to John Brenton for £20. Prisoner said he had returned the authority to Mr Morley. When arrested the prisoner has on him only £2-7-51⁄2.</p>
<p>John Brenton said he had bought the iron-grey filly for £20. Prisoner had showed him a receipt to the effect he had bought her from Mr Morley for £21, but the mare was not branded as described in the receipt – a fact Brenton said he could not see in the dark and only noticed the next morning.</p>
<p>Tootell said – The filly was brought over by Mr Morley from Charles Bennett for me to break in. I left the station and went as far as Kanyaka with cattle where I applied to Mr Morley (the overseer) to take the cattle from me. He said there was no one there to take the cattle and I had to take them 40 miles to Yangtrie. There was no one sent there to take the cattle and I refused to go further. [He then described the arrangements for continuing with the horse with the authority to do as he wished with her in the event of an accident.]</p>
<p>He was remanded for the evidence of Mr Boord and Mr Morley, but admitted to bail, himself in £50 and one surety for £25.</p>

<p>Public Meeting at Redruth</p>
<p>A public meeting was held at Redruth last Monday evening for the purpose of petitioning the Government to erect a bridge across the creek. A private subscription list was also started for the erection of a footbridge there and some £10-£12 was promised.</p>

<p>Notice. To Teamsters – The carting season on the Port Wakefield Road will commence on 10 August and the rates will be for coals and ore 30/- per ton. Gunny bags will no longer be found by the Company, but will be supplied by them at cost price. Coal will be refused to all who have drays unfit for its safe conveyance.</p>

<p>Main Lines of Road</p>
<p>The Surveyor-General Captain A.H. Freeling reports to parliament on SA’s main lines of road.</p>
<p>He lists 26 main roads extending for c. 668 miles.</p>
<p>At the close of 1856 about 118 miles of main road had been formed and metalled, leaving some 550 miles unmade.</p>
<p>Costs of metalling are c. £1,900 per mile.</p>
<p>[Given the huge cost of making the roads and then maintaining them at a cost of some £150 p.a. per mile, Captain Freeling sought to reduce expenditure by reducing the mileage of main roads. He removed for the list all roads running parallel to railways and also those near the coast where coastal transport might suffice (as for instance south of Noarlunga because jetties had been erected along the coast). He argued that the Adelaide-Gawler railway also allowed the Burra-Port Wakefield road to be removed from the list of main roads. The construction of the railway to Kapunda, he thought should see the main road to Clare repositioned to run from Kapunda to Clare. A whole lot of other argument follows on other main roads. His new length of main roads is thus reduced to c. 470 miles, of which some 74 miles are made and metalled.]</p>

<p>Central Board of Education</p>
<p>[This long report of the Chief Inspector outlines the schools across the colony.]</p>
<p>Kooringa</p>
<p>Mr Oakford, Kooringa.</p>
<p>Pupils present when inspected, 27 (1 destitute); pupils attending school, 59 (1 destitute); state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good.</p>
<p>Mrs Oakford, Kooringa.</p>
<p>Pupils present when inspected, 21 (1 destitute); pupils attending the school, 46 (1 destitute); state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good.</p>
<p>Mr Stephens, Kooringa.</p>
<p>Pupils present when inspected, 72 (1 destitute); pupils attending school 149 (1 destitute); state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good. Evening school, 21 pupils.</p>
<p>The Second Inspector stated that Mr Stephens intended applying for a pupil teacher. He had a person in view who would be very suitable for the situation, and he deserved encouragement, as he had got together so large a school, and already engaged the services of his wife and sister.</p>
<p>It was mentioned in the course of conversation that the Board would in every instance require that the pupil-teacher receive the full benefit of the extra allowance, his services being considered a sufficient compensation to the master for any instruction imparted to him.</p>
<p>Redruth</p>
<p>Mr Forder, Redruth.</p>
<p>Pupils present when inspected, 48; pupils attending school, 80; state of schoolroom, good; general discipline, good. Recommended for a licence from 1 April. Evening school 20 pupils.</p>
<p>Letters were read from Dr Mayne and Dr Maurau speaking very highly of Mr Forder, who was also recommended for a licence by the local ministers, and by Mr Stephens, the teacher at Kooringa.</p>
<p>It was resolved to grant his licence from the 1 April on the understanding he would expend a portion of the stipend on purchasing desks and other school requisites.</p>
<p>Opening of the Burra Burra Miners’ &amp; Mechanics’ Institute</p>
<p>This ceremony took place on 27 August. A tea meeting took place at 4 o’clock. It was well attended and was considerably enlivened by various hymns and pieces sung by both English and German choristers. After tea R.B. Robinson took the chair.</p>
<p>Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson, secretary of the Provisional Committee of the Institute, read his report.</p>
<p>The Committee cannot but congratulate members on the success that has attended their undertaking. Sufficient funds have been raised in sixteen months from the initial meeting to warrant the erection of the building in which we are assembled this evening and in which your Committee hope to see large numbers of the inhabitants daily assembled for the purpose of improving their minds and advancing their social position. This institution will bring such information within the reach of every man, however humble his lot.</p>
<p>‘The Burra Institute has been designed and erected to meet the wants and to increase the comforts of the poorest and humblest individual in the district&hellip;it is not, as some have supposed, intended for the exclusive use of those already possessed of ample means, and who have received in early life a liberal education.’</p>
<p>Up to this date a sum of more than £700 has been deposited in the Union Bank in Adelaide to the credit of the Institute and an equal sum has been placed on the Government estimates in favour of the same.</p>
<p>The contractors for the building will have to be paid £920. This leaves £480 to pay for the tables and seats, to increase the stock of books and to meet a portion of the cost of lighting, firing and attendance for the first year.</p>
<p>Subscriptions of members will also assist. The Directors of the SA Mining Association have generously promised £20 and the Manager of the English &amp; Australian Company’s Works will also assist. Books to the value of £35 have been ordered. H.S. Price of Canowie has ordered an additional £20 worth and will donate them to the Institute and Mr G.S. Kingston has made a similar promise. 15 papers and magazine are being sent regularly from England. At present there are 74 subscribers of £1 and upwards. The services of Mr W.H. Birbeck have been secured as Librarian. Your Committee is also glad to acknowledge the interest and encouragement of His Excellency the Governor. He has also enrolled his name among the subscribing members and has accepted the office as President of the Institute.</p>
<p>Rev. J.G. Wright moved the report be adopted and T.W. Powell seconded. Mr Powell said he had tried to form an Institute eight years previously, but had failed. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Rev. Thomas Hillman moved the following be appointed officers of the Institute. D. Mackay seconded and it was carried unanimously:</p>
<p>President His Excellency Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, C.B. &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
<p>Vice-Presidents Hon. Henry Ayers</p>

<p>Local Court, Redruth, 2 September, before Mr A. Motley.</p>
<p>John Burgess was fined 5/- for being drunk.</p>
<p>Patrick Sullivan, William Wall and A. Crawford were each fined 10/- for fighting at Aberdeen on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>George May Smith was fined 30/- for being drunk and riotous when in the station and in default, was sent to Gaol for 14 days.</p>
<p>Fritz Martin, an old offender, was fined 20/- for being drunk.</p>
<p>Edward Evans and David Williams were charged with feloniously assaulting Andrew Crawford at the Smelting Works. On Monday morning Crawford went into the little engine room (which appears to be a sort of drinking room), where the defendants were with many others. A bottled of gin was discussed and the complainant has a drink with the rest. When David Evans came in the gin was gone, supposed to be hidden. This caused some words. Crawford was suddenly caught by the hair and knocked down, when the whole company kicked at him. Eventually he got up and a man opened the door and let him out. He challenged any man singly, but did not mean to be murdered, first by one and then by another. David Williams threw a bottle at him and the whole party took to throwing slag, bricks and stones at him, to such an extent as to break the lights of the carpenters shop nearby.</p>
<p>W. Birt, G. Oliver and Mr Skewes corroborated the evidence in most material points and the defendants were committed for trial at the Court of Full Jurisdiction. Bail was afterwards taken for their appearance.</p>

<p>It appeared that the Inspectors had formed very good expectations of Mr Forder as a teacher. The Secretary stated that they had lately furnished him with maps and class-books from the depot to the amount of about £10.</p>

<p>Opening of the Gawler Town Railway [Editorial]</p>
<p>The railway to Gawler was opened yesterday when an excursion train of some 800 to 900 persons. Thousands of persons also crowded the stations at either end of the journey and other stationed themselves along the route to see the longest train yet moved by steam in SA. The 100 ton train was moved by a single engine, though the morning’s start was given by a second engine pushing behind. The carriages were decorated and many of them were new.</p>
<p>[The writer was concerned that tickets were not checked at either Adelaide or Gawler and he trusted that no ticket holders were excluded by the crush of those on the train. This, he says, must never happen again.]</p>
<p>The Gawler terminus was gaily decorated and omnibuses and other vehicles carried people into the town, about a half a mile* distant from the station. It was a very successful and happy excursion.</p>
<p>[*The reporter’s account places the station a mile from the town.]</p>
<p>6 October 1857, page 3</p>
<p>Opening of the Gawler Town Railway [From a reporter.]</p>
<p>The Commissioners decoded to accommodate as many as possible on the opening train to Gawler by providing a return ticket for 5/-. It was also arranged that the excursion train would leave after the arrival of the first train from Port Adelaide to accommodate passengers from there. Its return was arranged to meet the last train to Port Adelaide. The morning was cold and gloomy, but the rain held off except for one or two very light showers. The platform was thronged with people long before the scheduled departure time of 9 a.m. and hundreds more lined North Terrace to see the departure. There were 13 first and second class carriages and three or four open cars behind the engine and tender. The carriages were decorated with bunting and Union Jacks. The total numbers were between 800 &amp; 900. 505 tickets were sold , but in addition 43 passengers joined from Port Adelaide, mechanics and workmen employed on the line were allowed to go with their wives free of charge, a few joined at Salisbury and infants in arms went free and of course the official party and the band must be added.</p>
<p>Departure was delayed till 9.15 due to the late arrival of the Port Adelaide train. Salisbury was reached at 10 a.m. and there was then a delay of ten minutes. The train arrived at Gawler at 10.50 a.m.</p>
<p>Omnibuses took the crowd the mile into the town; their licensed number of passengers being greatly exceeded on this festive occasion, with many clinging to the roofs. The return journey began at 3.32 p.m. and Salisbury was reached at 4.11 p.m. Here the afternoon down train was late, which delayed the excursion train by 25 minutes. Adelaide was reached at 5.15 p.m. and again there were many spectators to see the event. The maximum speed attained was 33 m.p.h. on the return trip between Smithfield and Salisbury. The whole event was very well managed and the only accident occurred when a Union Jack on one of the carriages was ignited by a spark on the return journey.</p>

<p>Relief was given to two destitute widows. One was granted 10/- per week and the other was given £2 to proceed to Adelaide with her two small children, where further assistance might be given by the Destitute Board.</p>
<p>A poor woman who arrived a few days earlier from England, and who was confined in a hut in the creek without any means of support, was also given assistance.</p>
<p>Four poor men, who have been only a few days in the colony, and who are disabled by affliction, were considered destitute. One, with a large family, was allowed 15/- per week and the other three 10/- per week each.</p>
<p>Total relief granted for the month was £14.</p>
<p>Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its first Anniversary on Sunday 27 September and Thursday 1 October. On Sunday Rev. J.G. Wright preached impressive sermon in the morning and evening and Mr S. Olly gave a fine sermon in the afternoon. The chapel was very crowded in the morning and afternoon and many were unable to gain entry in the evening. The children rendered very credible recitations of prose and poetry.</p>
<p>On Thursday the children, headed by a band and carrying suitably inscribed banners, marched through the town. They ended at the chapel for the customary tea and cakes. The public tea meeting drew a large crowd and interesting addresses were delivered. During the year the school has increased from 40 to 100 and can be considered to be flourishing.</p>
<p>Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School</p>
<p>The Anniversary services of the school were held on 27 September. Sermons were preached by Mr William Moyle and Mr W. Orchard. On Thursday 1 October upwards of 70 children marched around the streets of Redruth, accompanied by Rev. M. Wilson and the Kooringa Wesleyan Society Choir. The usual tea and cake followed. More than 120 parents and friends attended the tea meeting afterwards. The proceeds of the Anniversary amounted to £18-18-4.</p>

<p>Roads in the North</p>
<p>In the period since November 1854 121,805 acres of land have been sold in the County of Light for £144,107. The County has 69 chains of metalled road, with 40 chains under construction. In Gawler County 86,427 acres have been sold for £109,073 and that County has 2 miles 1 chain of road with 1 mile 10 chains under construction. County Stanley has 51,617 acres sold for £59,514 and in that County there is 1 mile 1 chain of metalled road. In the County of Burra 6,276 acres were sold for £6,756 and there is no made road in that County. In Flinders 1,791 acres were sold for £2,138 and not one shilling has been spent on roads. In total the Government has received £321,598 for 267,906 acres and in return ahas constructed 3 mile 7 chains of roads.</p>

<p>‘A Traveller by the Clare Mail’ writes after the publication of the returns on land sales and road expenditure. He recommends that at least one member of the Central Road Board takes a seat in the Clare mail. They might then question the ‘perfectly significant’ sums expended on the line of road travelled by that mail.</p>
<p>Kooringa News</p>
<p>The Church of England Sunday School was to have had its annual treat on Friday 9 October, but inclement weather saw this deferred to Saturday 10 October. The Bishop had just arrived from Adelaide and he and Rev. Ibbetson met the children in St Mary’s Church. After the children had been examined by the Bishop they formed a procession through Kooringa and Aberdeen to the parsonage, where they were greeted by a hymn from the German Choristers. A booth had been erected to accommodate 150 and tea was prepared for the children. After that tea was served to the adults. A general scramble for nuts and sweetmeats was then enjoyed by the children. Bishop Short distributed prizes to the boys and Mrs Short to the girls. The Bishop delivered an impressive address to the children and the German choristers concluded the event with a hymn. There were 180 children and 100 adults present.</p>
<p>The Bishop and Rev. Ibbetson have just started on a missionary tour to the far north, making this the eighth tour by Rev. Ibbetson.</p>
<p>The mail cart arrived this afternoon (Friday 16 October) at the usual time, but instead of the mail from Adelaide it brought the mail sent from here yesterday morning. It seems the blunder occurred at the Kapunda post office. An express has been despatched this afternoon, so as to reach Kapunda with the mails before the time for starting in the morning.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association [Editorial]</p>
<p>The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held yesterday. The general theme is of continuing and increasing prosperity. The Directors propose to pay the usual dividends of 100% on the capital. In the last half-year the yield has been 5,724 tons of ore; an increase on the previous six months of 364 tons. The produce of the last ‘take’, extending over 9 weeks, amounted to 2,000 tons. This exceeds any other ‘take’ in the last six years. The average copper content of ore in the six months was estimated to be 24%.</p>
<p>The amount of ascertained profits available for immediate distribution is £40,894 and the Directors intend to pay a dividend of £5 per share (100%) on 2 December and on 3 March 1858. When the value of copper at present in the Company’s hands is realised there will be a further £52,306 for distribution, making a total undivided profit of £93,201. The Directors take note of recent fluctuations in the copper price, but are confident of realising their valuations.</p>
<p>Captain Roach reports new works with a course of ore thirty fathoms in length and sixteen feet wide. This is producing malachite of the best quality. In Roach’s Shaft at the 45 fathom level the position is even better. Here several galleries have been extended in different directions and each through a magnificent lode of malachite. The older workings too are ‘looking favourable throughout’. The number of persons employed has now reached 909 and the Mine may thus be presumed to furnish the means of subsistence for at least 3,000 people. Except for 5 in Adelaide and 14 at Karkulto all these employees are at Burra.</p>

<p>23 October 1857, page 3</p>
<p>Central Road Board</p>
<p>Messrs James Masters &amp; Samuel Stocks delivered a memorial to the Board. The memorial expressed their concern and surprise that the designated main road north from Gawler had been changed. Previously it had gone to Templer’s, the Light Bridge, Forrester’s [Tarlee] Riverton, Saddleworth, Chinkford [Chingford – later Manoora] (late Monkton’s Station), Black Springs, Burra. The new road is the less direct route to Sheoak Log, Kapunda, across Taylor’s Range to Forrester’s to Auburn. The memorialists considered that a few hundred pound spent on places along the old road, where water stood after heavy rains, would save a huge sum needed for the less direct route now proposed.</p>
<p>Mr Blyth thought the whole question would depend upon the railway, as there was a general feeling that where a railway went there should not also be a main road. As the railway was to be continued to Kapunda the main line of road would have to start from there.</p>
<p>The Chairman said the best road to Burra would then be by Tothill’s creek with the road to Clare via Forrester’s.</p>
<p>26 October 1857, page 3</p>
<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Company</p>
<p>The adjourned meeting of the proprietors was resumed on 12 August [Perhaps 2 August as the print is unclear.]</p>
<p>[The Chairman explained that when they had adjourned the meeting held in July 1856, they had anticipated getting the accounts from Australia in time to resume the meeting in October 1856. In fact the accounts were not received until February 1857. The accounts and the accountant’s report had been laid before the Committee, which had made five suggestions and these would be laid before shareholders at the meeting.]</p>
<p>The old contract with the Burra Burra Company had expired in April 1856.</p>
<p>A new contract had provisionally been entered into by Mr Hamilton for seven years from 29 May 1856, terminable at the option of the Company, on giving three months’ notice prior to 1 July or 1 October each year. This contract is more favourable than the old contract in three respects:</p>
<p>The power of termination outlined above.</p>
<p>The improved percentage of copper on the low produce ores.</p>
<p>The power of rejecting the low produce ores, providing that the whole of the ore raised in each period of two months does not average 17 %.</p>
<p>We note that the mine is now in full production, after the disruption of the gold rush, and the richest ores alone are being raised. The last report being about 27%. This is good for this company as the proportion of ore appertaining to this company from 100 tons at 27% is considerably larger than from 100 tons of ore at 17%, while the smelting charges do not increase in a corresponding ratio. The Committee therefore recommends confirming the provisional contract entered into by Mr Hamilton.</p>
<p>The financial position of the Company in England has much improved and there is a surplus on hand out of which the shareholders may declare a dividend of 2/6 per share, if they think it expedient to do so.</p>
<p>The gross assets in Australia at 30 June 1856 are £251,869-1-6. Cartage costs of ore are reducing. This year Mr Hamilton expects to move 8,000 tons at 30/- instead of 40/-, a saving of £4,000. There will be a saving on wages of £4,000 and a similar saving on freight, not including ore, which will be shipped as ballast. In all there is likely to be a saving on the cartage of ore and coal and on freight to England of c. £20,000. As a result the Committee recommends:</p>
<p>A continuation of operations in the colonies on the basis of the provisional contract with the Burra Burra Company.</p>
<p>That new auditors be appointed.</p>
<p>That a new and clear form of accounts be adopted.</p>
<p>That the AGM should be in February each year with accounts audited to 30 June preceding.</p>
<p>That the company be placed under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856, for the purpose of limiting liability, if such a course is found practicable.</p>
<p>After a long discussion the report was adopted.</p>
<p>Mr Schneider said that by February they would have £20,000 in hand.</p>
<p>Mr J.C. Hanson, Mr J.D. Powles, Mr H. Ranking &amp; Mr C.H.J. Rich were re-elected Directors. Mr H.C. Bentinck &amp; Mr Moates were appointed auditors.</p>
<p>A dividend of 2/6 per share was declared and the provisional contract with the SA Mining Association was confirmed unanimously.</p>
<p>27 October 1857, page 3</p>
<p>‘Go-Ahead’ writes re the Northern Mails.</p>
<p>The mails now take two days each way. I think this can be reduced in either one of two ways.</p>
<p>The mail leaves Adelaide by the 7.15 train and departs Gawler at 8.45 and reached Kooringa at 7 o’clock.</p>
<p>Depart Adelaide by the 3.45 train and depart Gawler the following morning at 6 a.m., arriving at Kooringa about 5 o’clock.</p>
<p>Any better plan would be welcome, but some change is needed, as at present four and sometimes five days must elapse before an answer can be received to a letter despatched from here. Steps should be taken now, as the tenders for the conveyance of the mails will soon be out.</p>
<p>30 October 1857, page 1</p>
<p>Advertisement. On and after 2 November Haimes’s Mail Coaches will run from Adelaide to the Burra in one day. Passengers leaving Adelaide by the 7 o’clock train will arrive at Burra the same day. Passengers leaving Burra in the morning will be in Gawler to meet the 5.45 p.m. train to Adelaide</p>
<p>Fares: From and to the train £1 each way. To Kapunda 6/- and from Kapunda to the Burra 14/-.</p>
<p>2 November 1857, page 3</p>
<p>‘Solon’ writes re the Northern Railway.</p>
<p>I consider the extension of the line from Kapunda to Burra is not what will best serve the interests of all north of Gawler. I believe the main line should run about three miles west of Templer’s, cross the River Light at the bridge, then run in a straight line to the Stone Hut, continuing north into Farrell’s Creek to receive the branch rail from the Burra, distance about 8 miles. A branch line from Kapunda should enter the main line at about Forrester’s, a distance of about 6 miles. This would open up more agricultural land and have easier gradients that the Kapunda line.</p>
<p>[The writer goes on to develop his point about the best agricultural land lying to the north of Gawler, with his proposed route central to it, while the Kapunda line will lie on its eastern margin. A terminus on Farrell’s Creek would give rise to a new town and would open up a large area of some of the best agricultural land in the colony.]</p>

<p>His Excellency Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell with Lady MacDonnell and suite left Adelaide at the beginning of the week to attend the Clare Show. They spent Tuesday night at Templer’s. On Wednesday they continued north, reaching Auburn shortly before noon. The town was gaily decorated and an escort of ladies and gentlemen rode out to greet the Vice-Regal guest. The party remained in Auburn for about two hours, taking lunch there. They gathered followers as they went north and by Penwortham the group numbered about 300[?]. [This figure is uncertain as the print here is faulty.] Triumphal arches had been erected at Watervale, Penwortham, Jacob’s Flat, Donnybrook and Clare. The Governor’s reception everywhere was cordial and enthusiastic. At Clare the Governor and suite were the guests of Mr E.B. Gleeson JP for the evening.</p>

<p>SA Mines</p>
<p>In 1856 there were 58 mines of copper and lead. Of these the chief was the famed Burra Burra copper mine. Operations commenced there on 29 September 1845 by twelve miners. Since that date the number of hands has increased to 1,013 and at this time there is a population connected with the mine and the associated Copper Works, of between 4,000 and 5,000. The quantity of ore raised from the commencement is 128,400 tons, which would yield about 25,700 tons of fine copper and be worth in Adelaide at the present time, £2,688,500. The colonial expenditure, exclusive of profits, amounts to £1,100,000 and in wages alone to £825,060. The present annual expenditure is upwards of £100,000. The aggregate dividend paid on each £5 share amounts to £200 and the total amount of dividends paid is £492,800. Shares are presently valued at £319,320 and the original capital was £12,300, which included the purchase of 10,000 acres of land, still held by the Association, with additions since made to it. The afore-mentioned expenditure is exclusive of the immense disbursements by the English &amp; Australian Copper Company, which is engaged in reducing the Burra Burra ores to copper. The surface area of the operation covers 15 acres and the length of open levels or galleries is eight miles.</p>
<p>5 January 1858, page 5</p>
<p>SA Mines</p>
<p>The mining interests in SA are in a most flourishing state. The SA Mining Association held its half-yearly meeting on 21 October, when most encouraging statement were laid before shareholders. During the half year in that report 5,724 tons of ore were raised; an increase of 364 tons on the preceding six months. The ore in this period averaged 24%. The property of the Association was listed as: 11,738 acres of the Burra Special Survey.</p>
<p>[Since the Special Survey was 10,000 acres, this figure presumably includes additions to it such as sections purchased just north of Section 4.]</p>
<p>Also: 1,740 acres known as the Sod Hut Estate, the Pompurne Estate of 798 acres and the Karkulto Mine comprising 320 acres. The total is 14,596 acres.</p>
<p>At the time of the last half-yearly report the Burra Burra Mines employed more than 900 people and the number has since increased. This supports a population of more than 4,000.</p>
<p>The Kapunda Mine was discovered in 1843 and the first ore was raised 9 January 1844. On 13 January the road to the Sheoak was marked out by a plough track and the first five dray-loads of ore set out for Port Adelaide 23 January 1844. On 4 March 1845 the first whim was erected. Eight others are now in use. 1 July 1848 the 30 inch steam engine began work. Smelting began in May 1849. On 17 March 1852 smelting was suspended due to the exodus to the goldfields. 1 March 1855 smelting resumed.</p>
<p>The deepest level now being worked is the 50 fathom. There are two steam engines at work. The 36 inch direct action engine is employed in pumping only. The 30 inch is employed in pumping, drawing, hauling, turning and crushing. . There is a brass foundry and a blast furnace and a 50 inch engine is on site, ready to be put up when required. There is also a water wheel and saw mill and a 10 horse-power portable engine for drawing and sawing. All ore is smelted into fine copper on the spot. There are five reducing furnaces, one copper furnace and one refinery in constant use. At present the employees number 238 men and 27 boys.</p>
<p>About 20 other mines are at work in various parts of the colony.</p>
<p>Captain Rodda says prospects at Crinnis’s Mine are good and a good amount of malachite has been found, but the heavy fall of water and inadequate machinery has meant little progress as yet.</p>
<p>Wheal Ellen silver-lead mine has been only operating a year, but prospects are good. More than 1,500 tons of ore have been raised and it has yielded 90,000 oz of silver and 600 tons of lead. About 100 men have been employed for some months.</p>
<p>Mr Chambers has opened up a promising copper mine near Mount Searle far to the north of Burra.</p>
<p>Little gold has been discovered, though the old Echunga workings are not deserted.</p>
<p>Coal is being sought and a sample from near Kapunda at a depth of 40 feet has been found, but it is not known if this will lead to anything.</p>

<p>Shingle Roofs</p>
<p>In the early days of the colony shingle roofs were almost universal. The material was readily available and houses were far enough apart in the city to prevent the spread of fire. Now the threat of fire is a serious problem and the insurance companies are raising prices to a prohibitive level on shingle roofed dwellings. For some years a great many of the new building have either been roofed in slate or galvanized iron. Hitherto buildings with shingle roofs have been able to be insured for 18/- per cent, but now the insurance offices require 34/- per cent, whilst buildings with roofs of iron or slate may be insured for from 14/- to 16/- per cent. Although we think the increase more than was necessary to cover the risk, we acknowledge some such move was required for the general good.</p>

<p>The foundation stone for this chapel was laid on Thursday 28 January by Rev. Hillman, who afterwards delivered a short and appropriate address. This was followed by an address from Rev. Wright. The building is to be 30 ft by 30 ft in the clear and 20 ft from floor to ceiling. It is to be in the Gothic style with a slate roof. After the ceremony the company retired to the Court-house, which had been kindly lent, for tea. After tea Rev. Wright chaired a public meeting. Addresses were given by Revs Mr Hillman and Mr Thomas and Mr Simmonds. More than £50 was collected.</p>

<p>Supreme Court Adelaide before the Acting Chief Justice, 19 February.</p>
<p>Henry King, Robert Houghton, Alexander Mayne and William Dreyer were indicted for ravishing Ann Perry on 22 January at the Burra Survey.</p>
<p>Ann Perry aged about 19 said that on Friday 22 January Mayne asked her to go for a walk. She went with him for about ten or twelve steps from the house in which a pound-keeper resides. They sat down on the ground and he immediately began to treat her improperly. Mayne then completed the offence for which he was being tried. She tried to keep him off, but was not strong enough. Mayne then ran away and the other prisoners were coming over the hill. King came up to her and without speaking committed the same offence. She could not prevent it, but cried out as loudly as she could. Dreyer and Houghton and a man called Roe were about ten steps off. The other prisoners then perpetrated the offence with which they were charged. Roe came up and took hold of her, but she got away and saw a carriage going along the road. She ran after it screeching and hastened to her home about half a mile distant. She got home about 10 p.m. Her bonnet and cape were torn and she got in the back way and lay down without speaking to her mother and sister. She did not tell her mother until the following Monday and the next morning Dr Mayne examined her.</p>
<p>His Honour asked if there was medical evidence. The Crown Prosecutor said there was, but if he was allowed to exercise his discretion he would withdraw the case, as he thought it useless to proceed with such evidence as the girl had given them.</p>
<p>Dr Mayne said he had examined the girl on 28 January and found her appearance like that of a married woman who had had children. He found no evidence of violence and he felt confident she had not been a virgin six days previously.</p>
<p>His Honour asked if, after hearing the medical evidence, they could believe the prosecutrix. They said they could not.</p>
<p>His Honour said they had taken a most reasonable view of the matter.</p>
<p>The prisoners were liberated. The prosecutrix was not allowed her expenses.</p>

<p>SA Mines (From the Mining Journal of 12 December 1857.)</p>
<p>After reports from the Strathalbyn Mining and Smelting Company and the Worthing Mines (SA) the article goes on the English &amp; Australian Copper Co.:</p>
<p>Advices to 7 October say that carting of both coal and ore had fairly commenced, under very favourable auspices. The carting for the year ending 30 June had exceeded 28,000 tons. The Company’s wharf is now connected with Gawler (26 miles north of Adelaide) by rail, and the coal and ore traffic was about to commence. About 2,000 tons of ore were in course of, or ready for shipment. The mob of horses had arrived from NSW and the mules were engaged in carting from the Murray Scrubs and were looking very well. The works continued in full operation and labour was generally more abundant.</p>

<p>Government Grant to Mechanics’ Institutes</p>
<p>The Government has recently made the offer of a grant to Societies whose last annual subscription list amounted to £100. We initially said that the Burra Burra and the East Torrens Institutes were likely to be the only ones able to avail themselves of this offer. We are glad to correct this by adding Magill Institute to the list. Magill has applied and received it; becoming the first country institution to turn the offer to practical account.</p>
<p>10 March 1858, page 3</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mechanics’ Institute</p>
<p>[This article takes the form of a long letter from Rev. Ibbetson.]</p>
<p>Last Saturday you pointed out the conditions attached to the Government grant to Institutes before it could be applied for; specifically that the last annual subscription list must have amounted to £100. Since the Burra Burra Institute has only been going for six months, it cannot literally comply. Moreover, it is true that subscriptions of over £50 in six months do not guarantee there will be more than £100 in a year. Nevertheless there are circumstances which would justify Burra’s receiving a £50 share of the money available.</p>
<p>These facts include that there are now 16 life members who have each subscribed £10 and upwards, five 10-year members subscribing £5 each, and since the opening 68 ordinary members at £1 each per annum, though it would not do to assume that those who are backward with their second quarter subscriptions will all be bona fide members. An additional £30 has been contributed towards the first year expenses.</p>
<p>The first preliminary meeting held with a view to establishing an Institute took place on 7 April 1856. Whilst all present were agreed on the value and desirability of such an institution, it was decided that the cost was too great to proceed with the project. I then sought and obtained an interview with the H.E. Sir Richard MacDonnell who expressed his approval of such efforts and who gave me to understand the Government was likely to support such efforts to the extent that the people themselves were able and willing to assist it.</p>
<p>At the first public meeting on the subject, held at the Burra Hotel on 6 June, I mentioned the Governor’s interest and the prospect of Government aid and the promise of support from the SA Mining Association and the English &amp; Australian Copper Company. About 120 people attended and created a most promising impression. £93 was subscribed at its close. A committee was set up and on 22 July I was able to tell the then Colonial Secretary that the funds of the Institute amounted to £525 plus £25 promised toward the first year’s operating costs and to ask His Excellency for a sufficient sum to begin the building, which was estimated to cost £1,000.</p>
<p>The reply was that the Government was prepared to place on the Estimates one third of the cost of a suitable building if it were certified that the remaining two thirds had been paid into a bank to the credit of the Institute.</p>
<p>Some more funds were raised and it was possible to send in a certificate that rather more than £700 stood to the account of the Institute, together with a request that the Government contribution be transferred to the account.</p>
<p>Before the Estimates were brought forward I called on the Colonial Treasurer of the day (Mr Torrens) and was delighted to learn that the sum proposed was equal to that raised locally. (A sum, I believe of £703 and some shillings.) I was pleased to communicate this fact to the public on the opening of the building on 27 August 1857.</p>
<p>The Committee, acting on the good faith of the Government entered into contracts for the building and when it was completed a balance remained of about £400. This balance was far below the sum placed on the Estimates, but a little above that officially promised.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to describe the disappointment felt by the Committee and the public, when, upon Mr Finniss retiring from the office of Chief Secretary, his successor, Mr Torrens, reduced the amount on the Estimates from £700 to £50, although he had spoken to me in the highest terms of our project, and had expressed himself in no doubt that the amount would be passed by the Legislature.</p>
<p>The general interest in the Institute began to flag after this. On the day of the opening the building was crammed with people, but the hopes of the expectation of the £700 were soon dashed bay the appearance in the papers of the sum of £50 opposite the Burra Institute in the Estimates and the sum of £700 opposite that of a certain artillery battery.</p>
<p>I had taken the precaution of furnishing one of the Members for Burra with all the financial details, requesting him to take up the matter in the House, but this was not done, perhaps because he was not in the House at the time it came up.</p>
<p>I feel it is necessary to lay rhe full story before the public, as otherwise people who have had unfulfilled promises of support brought under their notice, may feel, without a connected statement of the facts, that I am open to the charge of misleading them.</p>
<p>The committee have individually contributed nobly to the Institute, but cannot but feel aggrieved at being compelled to make arrangements for meeting their creditors to the extent of about £300, even after taking credit for the £50 voted for the Institute and the £50 just applied for.</p>

There are also rumours that the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. have struck a good lode on the Royal Mining Association’s property, and were raising ore worth £45 per ton. Some of the shareholders here went down yesterday to visit it, and the result is that one of them has gone to Adelaide with samples for assay.</p>

<p>Persons holding shares in the Royal Mining Co. at Black Springs are in great spirits. A few months ago the Patent Copper Co. made arrangements with the Royal to work an iron lode on one of their sections for use as a smelting flux. On going down they found the lode gradually changed to copper and now a solid lode of copper three feet wide is presented. It is hoped that better things will develop as work proceeds. It is already known that in the Karkulto Mine, belonging to the Burra Burra Co. and lying adjacent to the Royal, a fine lode has been cut.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mine present a scene of activity almost unsurpassed in its history. The company is now regularly paying quarterly returns of 100% upon the original shares. The immense quantity of ore being brought to grass suggests this will continue for some time to come.</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Mine has commenced operations on land adjacent to the Burra Burra, where some suppose large lodes will be found.</p>
<p>The Karkulto Mine, about 15 miles south of Kooringa and owned by the Burra Burra Co., is also producing some good ore.</p>
<p>The Royal Mining Co.’s property adjoining the Karkulto Mine has also recently exposed a lode of rich copper said to be 3 feet wide.</p>
<p>Messrs Chambers &amp; Co. &amp; Messrs Parker &amp; Co. have opened mines with some promise in the far north.</p>
<p>The Kapunda Mine is also working well and smelting its ore to fine copper.</p>
<p>Mining is going on favourably in the Mt Barker and Strathalbyn areas where large deposits of copper, lead and silver are indicated. At Wheal Ellen the ore being raised is jack, yielding from 30 to 35% lead and 30 oz silver to the ton. About 2,000 tons of this ore are laid open.</p>

<p>Royal Mining Co.</p>
<p>The lease by the Patent Copper Co. on the Royal Company’s property expired on 7 April. Royal Company Directors: C.S. Hare, I.D. Henry and His Worship the Mayor of Adelaide, visited the site on Thursday last. It is understood that the Patent Copper Co. managed to remove some 60-70 tons of copper ore before their lease expired. The Directors took specimens and it is believed the property will be worked, if the extent of the lode justifies that. It is located about 14 miles south of Kooringa, 11⁄4 miles from the Black Springs and 2 miles from Karkulto Mine.</p>
<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School Children and their teachers walked in procession though the town on Easter Monday before partaking of tea, cake and fruit at the chapel. Addresses on the benefits of attending Sunday school were delivered by Rev Messrs Flockart, Colwell, J.G Wright and others. A meeting in the evening celebrated the anniversary of the founding of the chapel. A collection for the Sunday School amounted to £66.</p>
<p>The Edouin Family has been in Kooringa for the last week, playing to middling houses. Their reputation suggests a better turnout, but perhaps this was affected by Easter sports and the knowledge that Burton’s Circus is coming soon.</p>
<p>The Usual Easter Wrestling took place among miners at Kooringa on Saturday and Monday. The first prize of £10-10-0 went to James White and the second, £6-6-0 to John Paull. The whole passed off very quietly.</p>

<p>The 13th AGM of the SA Mining Association was held last Wednesday at the Company’s office in Adelaide. One of the largest shareholders, J.B. Graham was in attendance. He is presently visiting the colony from Frankfurt, where he has taken up residence. The report gives a glowing account of prospects and of the increased production over the last six months. In the sic months to 31 March 6,304 tons was raised. This is an increase of 940 tons on the same period a year earlier and 580 tons more than for the immediately previous six months. The average produce has been 23-24%. For the year ending 31 March 1857 the ore raised was 10,961 tons. This was raised at a cost of £128,780-6-3 or £11-15-0 per ton. It realised £171,403-3-8 or £15-12-9 per ton. This yielded a profit of £42,622-17-5 or £3-17-9 per ton. The total nett profit for the year was £44,226-9-4. The balance for credit in the profits and loss account to 30 September last was £40,894-12-1 however; out of this the last two dividends were paid, amounting to £24,640. The residue, with the profits of the year brings the balance of profit to £60,481-1-5. The estimated value of produce on hand is based on the latest figures from England, which show a fall in copper prices to £9-10-0 per ton. The Directors expect that copper prices will rally and estimate the profit will therefore rise by £20,937-19-4, making altogether a divisible balance of £81,419-0-9.</p>
<p>[Note: The Register printed a correction to this last sentence on 23 April, page 2:</p>
<p>‘We ought to have said the sum of £20,937-19-4 was the expected profit receivable on the realization of the ore and copper on hand, if sold at the present reduced prices, which, with the £60,481-1-5 of profit already obtained, make a divisible balance of £81,419-0-9. But should the Directors’ anticipations prove correct, and the price of copper return to the former rate, then £15,000 additional would be obtained for the produce now unsold; and the balance of £81,419-0-9 would be increased to £96,419-0-9.]</p>
<p>It is intended to pay the usual dividends of £5 per share (i.e. 100%) on 2 June and 1 September.</p>
<p>Ore raised and on hand totalled 12,056 tons. Of this 7,336 tons have been delivered to the English &amp; Australian Copper Co., 5 tons have been exported and 4,715 tons remain on hand. Copper on hand and delivered from the Copper Co. amounts to 1,180 tons 5 cwt and of this 505 tons have been exported for sale, 499 tons 9 cwt have been sold in the colony and 175 tons 16 cwt remain on hand.</p>
<p>Expenditure for the year, including wages, cartage etc. has amounted to 147,193-12-5. Employed at the Mine are:</p>
<p>Tributers 253</p>
<p>Tutworkmen 96</p>
<p>Timbermen, weighers &amp; others 253</p>

<p>A new arrangement has been made with the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. on terms proposed some time ago and submitted to the Directors of the Copper Co. in England.</p>
<p>The report of the Chief Mine Captain speaks in very favourable terms of the prospects. Another large pumping engine is expected daily. This is expected to permit a large extent of new tribute ground to be opened up. The cost of operations has increased in the last few months because of the necessity of repairing old sections and the employment of more tutworkers in exploring operations.</p>
<p>The high profit figure for 1856 relates to the high price of copper at that time.</p>
<p>‘We wish the Directors of the Burra Burra could see it right to offer such terms to persons settling on their property at Kooringa as might induce them to improve the appearance and condition of the township, as it presents a most abject and forbidding aspect to a stranger visiting it. The town ought to be under municipal regulations, that the accumulation of rubbish in the various thoroughfares might be cleared away. It is also desirable that the dilapidated buildings should be removed or renovated.’</p>
<p>23 April 1858, page 3</p>
<p>Henry Ayers Secretary of the SA Mining Association writes to the Editor in response to the suggestion that the Directors should induce residents to improve the appearance of Kooringa:</p>
<p>The leases are granted on generous terms for 21 years at the nominal rent of from £1 to £5 per half acre for town lands. Persons applying for extensions to leases have always been liberally treated. From time to time the Company has spent large sums of money on improving Kooringa, including cleaning the streets, but it can scarcely be expected that a company that laid out the township some 12 or 13 years ago, should be expected to continue to make bridges, repair streets, and act as scavenger.</p>
<p>‘It is time that the inhabitants made some effort to remedy what I most willingly admit to be a very serious evil.’</p>
<p>[The editor urges the residents to at once petition the Government for the extension of the Corporation Act to the town.]</p>
<p>Royal Mining Co. shareholders, living in Kooringa, went down to see the mine today and to look at the property they personally bought, adjacent to it. They report great alterations at the Royal following the employment of a number of men by Mr Hare. The lode has been exposed. They have decided to ‘set’ their property. They have consequently set men to work to costeen over their property, which they call by the native name of Pinyonga. It is believed there are many offering to work at either property.</p>

<p>Obituary. News came in last week that the remains of a man were found on Mr Young’s station of Caroona. Mr Macdonald went out to investigate. He has every reason to believe that the remains are those of Mr Jack Whittingham, known as Jack the Baker who has been missing for some time and who was in a state of delirium when he left the hut. A search at the time failed to find any trace. The body had been dismembered by wild dogs, but a jumper found on it has been identified as Whittingham’s.</p>
<p>[SA Deaths CD offers no help in this matter.]</p>
<p>The SA Mining Association Directors left Burra on Friday 30 April to travel to Clare. They intended looking at their property at the Emu Flats, the Pompurne Estate. It is said they intend to set to work to prove it. It is a success it will cause a big stir at Clare.</p>
<p>Mr Burton and his circus have left Burra for Clare.</p>

<p>SA Mining [Editorial]</p>
<p>[The editor begins by saying how important the mining interest has been in SA and how good it is that it is again doing so well. The agricultural interest is also important, but an expanded mining interest would provide the population to be the market for that and that market would be even more rewarding than selling the wheat and flour to diggers in other colonies, just as a larger population would enable some of our wool to be manufactured locally to the advantage of all. Mining was doing better in SA than it had at any time in the previous six years. In that period only Burra Burra and Kapunda Mines have made a profit and even those two were closed for some of the period due to shortage of labour. At the start of 1858 there were about 20 mines at work in SA.]</p>
<p>Since then Mr Chambers has begun to develop the copper discoveries at Mt Searle. A new lode has been discovered on the royal Mining Co.’s property. There is renewed activity in the Mt Barker, Strathalbyn and Bremer mining areas. Now there is news from the SA Mining Association’s Pompurne Estate some 4 miles northwest of Clare. Two men have been prospecting there for some time and we hear the results have prompted the Directors to take more energetic measures to exploit the property. The English mails brings news of a rise in the copper price of £9-10-0 per ton. This increases the value of produce on hand at the Burra Burra Co. by some £15,000. News also comes of the migration of more miners from the west of England. In short nothing can be more promising than the prospects at present before SA mining interests.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held last week on the body of a lad named Roach, who was found drowned in a waterhole at Baldina. He was out bullock-hunting with his father, another man and a boy. The boys and men had separated and on going round the edge of a waterhole, the boy stood on an overhanging section of bank and fell in. The other lad tried to help, but when he was unable to save the boy it was almost two hours before assistance could be obtained. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>
<p>[Thomas Roach died 4 May 1858 Baldina, residence Kooringa aged 11. He seems to have been the son of Thomas Roach 1817-82 who arrived in SA with his family in 1848. (BISA)]</p>

<p>The Royal Mining Co.</p>
<p>[The report of the Directors to the half-yearly meeting is printed. They report the activities at their Karkulto property as already noted and then go into much more detail on the prospects of the discovery made by the E. &amp; A. Copper Co. while leasing the site. They also report extensively on samples taken from the site. The reported having £2,386 immediately available to develop the mine and have called for tenders from miners to operate the site. They prefer this to operating the mine on their own account. If this process fails, they then propose to spend £1,000 in sinking a good trial shaft on the most promising ground.</p>

<p>A Dangerous Waterhole</p>
<p>One of Mr Rounsevell’s men was driving a horse in a gig from Adelaide to Kooringa when he turned aside to let the horse drink at a waterhole near the road in the neighbourhood of the Dirty Light. After stepping in about a yard the horse slipped forward and disappeared with the gig, leaving the driver to swim for his life. Several similar accidents are reported from the same place. People told the driver it was useless to try to extricate the gig. Mr John Rounsevell has decided to try his had at recovering it nevertheless. So far we have no news of the outcome.</p>

<p>Obituary. Last week in Kooringa Mrs Collins was at her usual household work when seized with an apoplectic fit and died within half an hour. [Elizabeth Collins died 19 May 1858 at Kooringa aged 47.]</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held on the body of Joseph Jones aged about 25. He had been laughing and joking with others before going to bed and was dead within 20 minutes. He had just returned from the diggings, where he had been working for several years. He was employed at the Copper Works as a smelter. He had been in SA about 10 years, being among the first group of smelters sent out. It is said his father had died suddenly on the diggings. The jury returned a verdict of death by the visitation of God.</p>
<p>[Despite the above this is almost certainly Joseph James who died 20 May 1858 aged 25 at Kooringa. The only registration of a Jones dying in May 1858 is of a one-day-old child at Gawler West.]</p>
<p>Weather. There has been very little rain in the district of Burra and it ahs been very cold, with maxima of c. 54°F. Many lambs have been dying from the cold and the absence of fresh feed.</p>
<p>The Kooringa Court has been very quiet, though Thomas Viant was fined £5 for drunkenness, the heavy fine reflecting his third offence.</p>

<p>Whit Monday in Kooringa was kept at a holiday in Kooringa, it being the Queen’s birthday and also a traditional holiday amongst the miners. The Bible Christian Sunday School held its Anniversary. Sermons were preached by Rev. Keen in the morning and evening and by Rev. J.G. Wright in the afternoon. On Monday 24th Rev. Hillman and the teachers led a procession of 158 pupils around the principal streets, attended by a band. Afterwards they enjoyed tea, cake, fruit etc. There was also a public tea for about 400, though half as many again would have been glad to gain admittance. A public meeting followed.</p>
<p>The annual races at Mr Oram’s Cross Roads Hotel were also held, some three miles from Kooringa. Some good racing occurred. Six races are reported with results printed.</p>

<p>Kooringa storekeepers are grumbling at the cost of cartage, which at present is £5-£6 per ton. Some of the goods are two months on the road and get spoiled. Small parcel costs are outrageous. One small parcel not over six inches long cost 5/- and one man refused to take delivery of a small parcel because of the cost. A railway is sorely needed.</p>

Finlay Mackay admitted breaking Mr Gubbins’s window by accident and was fined £1 plus costs; it not being the first time he had annoyed Mr Gubbins. Prangley and Schofield were found guilty of the offence at Corey’s and each was fined £1 plus costs. There was insufficient evidence to connect Barclay with the offences and that case was dismissed.</p>

<p>Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel. The second anniversary of this chapel was held on 25 &amp; 26 July. Morning and evening sermons were held by Rev. J. Standrin of Salisbury and in the afternoon the Bible Christian minister Rev. T. Hillman preached the sermon. Despite very unpropitious weather, the church was filled for each service. On Monday there was a sumptuous tea. The weather continued bad with boisterous winds and heavy showers. Between 300 and 400 people were fed despite the almost impassable roads through which those attending had literally to wade. At the public meeting the costs of the church were reported for the year.</p>
<p>[The figures are indistinct and don’t appear to add up. The debt from last year on the chapel and ministers house seems to be £181-9-0, but would need to be £191-9-0 to reach the total cited: this year’s costs being; enlarging the chapel £286-18-0, lighting and cleaning £21-16-3, new lamp £1; for a total of £501-3-3.]</p>
<p>During the year they had collected £255-1-8, including £100 at the anniversary. This left a debt of £244-12-7, which was considered very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Rain has fallen plentifully for the past eight days rendering the township a mass of mud and stopping most transport. Foot traffic is almost impossible and but few drays are venturing forth. It has also been bitterly cold, keeping most people indoors and presenting a miserable aspect to visitors, such as the two gentlemen from Mr Gregory’s overland party, who visited last Sunday.</p>
<p>[Gregory’s party had come south from Queensland along the Strzelecki Creek in search of the missing explorer, Ludwig Leichhardt, passing along the eastern edge of Lake Blanche and the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges.]</p>
<p>The township of Warrapoota was offered for sale at the Burra Hotel last Thursday in blocks of one, two, three and five acres, but there were no purchasers. It was offered again on Saturday with a similar result. There is much land on offer at present, viz., Millerton, Clonmel, Copperhouse, Hampton, Roach Town, Nelson, Yarwood and Warrapoota; beside land in the townships of Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen.</p>
<p>[Note that of these, the locations of Clonmel and Warrapoota are unknown.]</p>
<p>A meeting of the creditors of Messrs Liston &amp; McFarlane, tanners and curriers, was held at the Burra Hotel on Saturday. A committee was appointed to go into their affairs and report on Monday. This found their assets exceeded their liabilities by about £300. Whether they are forced into bankruptcy will largely depend on creditors in the city. It is to be hoped they are not hard pressed as they are hard-working men and have recently made improvements that have cost more than they would now get back.</p>
<p>A kangaroo hunt was held last week by a group of locals with others from Clare and Adelaide. They set out on Tuesday for the scrub and camped out that night. On Wednesday they scored seven kangaroos.</p>

<p>On Tuesday 30 July Mr Townsend of the firm of Wicksteed, Bitting, Townsend &amp; Co. conducted an auction of land for Mr Nelson. The Township of Nelson was offered. After spirited bidding all but five allotments were sold and we hear that the proprietor has since had offers for those that are higher than on the day.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. the same day allotments in the Town of Yarwood, some three miles south of Kooringa on the Adelaide Road, were offered and a great number of allotments were purchased. Altogether it has been the most successful land sale held at Burra and has astonished the local tradesmen, who have been complaining of the dullness of trade.</p>
<p>A new footbridge has been erected in Chapel Street, chiefly owing to the exertions of Mr William Vercoe, who gathered subscriptions for it. It is well built and a credit to its builder, Mr John Stevens. It will be of great service to those attending either church or chapel as well as to school children.</p>
<p>The Redruth and County of Burra Building Society held its AGM at Redruth on Wednesday evening 3 August. The accounts showed a credit balance of £159. Three shares were sold. The first two brought £14 and the third £12-15-0.</p>

<p>A Primitive Methodist Chapel has been opened near the source of the Dirty Light, about nine miles south of Black Springs. Services have been held near here for about two years in a cottage. An acre of land was given by Mr Joseph Kinsey of Salisbury and building commenced. On Sunday 1 August the building was opened with three services by Rev. H.B. Thomas in the morning and afternoon and Rev. J.G. Wright in the evening. A tea meeting was held on Monday and the opening services brought in £77-1-0. The stone building is in the Gothic style. It is planned to start a day school as soon as a teacher can be found, as there is no school within six miles.</p>

<p>Burra Institute</p>
<p>A member writes complaining that this is a miserable excuse for an Institute:</p>
<p>There are few books and those there are of a cheap and inferior kind. I believe there is now twice the number of books as there are members.</p>
<p>The want of accommodation for persons wishing to pass a quiet evening reading is shocking. The seats are unplanned planks and the tables unplanned boards. The fire is often out and the light always poor and often out when a solitary person wishes to enter and read.</p>
<p>There have been but three or four lectures in the past year instead of one a month, as there ought to be. Some of the lectures have been more like missionary meetings than popular lectures to miners and mechanics. Few honour religion more than the writer, but still, he does not like to see it dragged into what professes to be an entirely secular institute.</p>
<p>What the cause may be the writer does not know, but he hopes they may soon be addressed by a meeting of members.</p>

<p>The Burra Creek. ‘Viator’ writes that accidents at the creek are a frequent occurrence due to the stoppage of flow caused by the silting of the creek from the workings of the Mine. The bed of the creek has been raised 12 to 14 feet in the last ten years due to sand from the workings. Last Friday a boy with a four-wheeled carriage and horse was nearly drowned opposite Mr Woollacott’s and that at a place supposed to be a ford. Every week some incident arises at this place. What is the use of petitions if no notice is taken of them? Mr Peake’s petition has seen no action.</p>

<p>Burra Institute: The Secretary responds to the complaint of 16 August.</p>
<p>There are as many books as £35 could purchase in England and nearly 100 that have been donated by friends. A donation of £20 worth is daily expected from England. This is all that the Committee has been able to expend. An equal amount has been spent on periodicals.</p>
<p>The seating and tables may indeed be ‘shocking,’ but I cannot see how the Committee can remedy this until there is money in hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the member’s letter will call the attention of the Legislature to the need to assist the Institute to engage someone, at least for a year or two, to organise the objects that it was originally designed to achieve.</p>
<p>The person residing in the Institute says that the fire has often been out because in the wet weather so few came to the Institute that he decided for a while to defer lighting it until a reader arrived. This will not occur again.</p>
<p>If the complainant wishes to have lectures that are less missionary in tone, perhaps he will volunteer his services or be willing to donate greater funds. Placing limits on what speakers may say would only further diminish the number of lectures.</p>
<p>At the approaching annual meeting no doubt the complainant will attend and express himself plainly and will be able to introduce more books, planed tables and chairs, a salaried librarian and will himself take up the thankless office of Secretary.</p>

<p>On 1 September a public meeting of members and friends of the Church of England took place in the Redruth Court House to consider the desirability of building a church at Redruth. Mr Joseph Genders occupied the chair. Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson opened the meeting with a prayer. Various proposed sites were discussed, but the unanimous conclusion was that the one secured to them through the kindness of William Paxton was the best; that is allotments 82 &amp; 92 in Redruth. A committee was formed to advance the project. Advertisements are to be placed in the Register, the Observer and the Chronicle newspapers to call for funds, along with 300 circulars. The next committee meeting will be on 22 September Rev. Ibbetson said an account had been opened at the Union Bank in Adelaide and £140 had already been promised, including £50 by the Lord Bishop of Adelaide from funds at his disposal. A large number of circulars had been distributed in Adelaide and some sent to England. The meeting was characterised by a zeal, unanimity and fixedness of purpose not easily surpassed.</p>

<p>An Election Meeting was held on Saturday 4 September to hear the political views of Mr McEllister. The meeting had not been widely advertised and it was 8 p.m. before about 40 people assembled and proceedings could begin. Mr G. Leon was elected to the chair in the absence of any person who had been long in the town.</p>
<p>Mr McEllister’s main points:</p>
<p>He would resign at any time if requested to do so by one third of the electors.</p>
<p>He favoured law reform.</p>
<p>Supported Mr Torrens’ Real Property Act.</p>
<p>Was for free distillation.</p>
<p>Opposed large scale emigration and thought the present one ship a month was too much.</p>
<p>Supported railway expansion, favouring the route through the Gilbert Valley and liked the ides of an extension to Mount Remarkable.</p>
<p>Would support a rate to maintain roads beyond the District Councils.</p>
<p>Did not like land speculators, but thought it hard to prevent their operations.</p>
<p>He favoured the extension of education.</p>
<p>A motion declaring him a fit and proper person to be elected was carried without dissent and the quietest election meeting ever held in Burra was all over in about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Obituary. John Benjamin, died [in Kooringa] on 1 September aged 39. Despite the stormy day the shops were closed on the 2 September and everyone turned out as a mark of respect to follow the deceased’s remains to the cemetery. He was a member of both the Freemasons and the Oddfellows, and members of these lodges turned out to form one of the largest funerals seen in Burra.</p>
<p>On Saturday Mr McEllister addressed electors in the large room of the Burra Hotel. His answer to the question whether he would support the extension of the railway was memorable: ‘Yes, by J _____ s, I will, through thick and thin, to Mount Remarkable, if it’s wanted.’ As yet there is no opposition in the field.</p>
<p>[Note that a letter to the editor from McEllister in the paper of 14 September page 3 denied that this vulgar and impious sentence had been uttered and ascribed it to the animus of the local correspondent. He notes that their correspondent who reported the actual meeting did not attribute any such statement to him.]</p>
<p>The talented Nelson Family gave three of their popular musical entertainments here in the last week. The poor weather did not prevent a good house on Monday and a fresh program on Tuesday drew the biggest house yet seen here. The Wednesday performance also drew a full house.</p>
<p>[How a report dated 9 September got printed in Adelaide in the paper of 10 September is rather hard to fathom.]</p>

<p>A New Oddfellows’ Lodge was opened at Bro. Lamb’s Aberdeen Hotel, Aberdeen on Thursday 9 September. The officers of the Adelaide District assisted by brethren of the Burra Lodge walked in procession with the Kooringa Band, from their lodge room to the new lodge room, where the new lodge was constituted and opened. At 7 p.m. more than 100 of the brethren sat down to a sumptuous dinner prepared by Brother Lamb. Bro. T.W. Powell occupied the chair. [The toasts are reported and in the process the following brethren are named: Wells, John Kent, James Prongley, Forder, J. Genders, H. Genders, B. Opie, Gibbs and Ryan.]</p>

<p>Bon Accord Mine. At Messrs Hall &amp; Co. store in Grenfell Street there can be seen specimens of copper ore from the Bon Accord Mine. They are to be sent on to the London Office. They are fine examples and offer a favourable indication of the shaft from which they were taken. Work there has stopped at present for want of means to drain the shaft. The engine, we are told, is in the course of erection.</p>

<p>Kooringa News</p>
<p>A mineral lese has been taken out by Messrs Bath &amp; Bosance of Kooringa for a section at Bundaleer, about 30 miles away. A picked sample gave 411⁄2% copper and rough stone on the surface 28 and 32%, so there is some chance of another Burra starting there. The first stone was assayed by Mr Richard Davey of Adelaide. It is not known whether it will be worked by private enterprise of if a company will be formed.</p>
<p>At the Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute on 20 August a lecture was delivered by Mr T.P. Hill of Adelaide on Public Speaking. Mr Hill said this skill needed more attention. It was not a gift, but could be acquired. The lecture occupied two hours.</p>

<p>The German Choral Society gave a concert in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Monday last, to which they invited the principal residents. A strong following attended. They were assisted by Messrs Chapman &amp; Ware, who sang a duet, and by Messrs Siekemann &amp; Chapman who sang several songs. A ball followed the concert.</p>
<p>There was a Wesleyan Bazaar in the schoolroom on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to aid trust funds. There was a great variety of fancy work, engravings, clothing and every type of farm produce. The first day raised almost £200 and the three days £382, since when several lots have been sold to bring the total to over £400.</p>
<p>On Thursday night there was a lecture in the chapel by Rev. Colwell on The Intellectual Progress of Our Race. About 400 attended. The lecture lasted for about three hours.</p>
<p>Today there was excitement at the arrival of several specimens from the section recently leased by Messrs Bath and Bosance. They are splendid examples of copper ore. A stone seven feet from the surface was broken by Captain Killicoat and assayed by Mr A. Thomas of Kooringa. It gave a produce of 55%.</p>
<p>Mr Thomas Rosewall has been appointed Captain at the Royal Mining Co.’s mine at Karkulto. This is a wise appointment as he has been working on the ground for a long time and knows the place better than anyone.</p>

<p>Proposed Redruth Church of England</p>
<p>A public meeting of members of the congregation of St Mary’s, Kooringa was held in the church last Wednesday evening to co-operate with the inhabitants of Redruth in their efforts to build a church there. Mr John Winnall chaired a well-attended meeting. Rev. Ibbetson opened the meeting with prayer and outlined the need for the building. The secretary of the committee [Mr Ewbank] read the minutes and letters from sundry gentlemen in Adelaide who had offered to furnish plans for the building. The meeting then passed a motion of wholehearted support for the project.</p>

<p>The Wheal Sarah Mine. The beautiful specimens of copper ore described by our Kooringa correspondent [8 October] are now to be seen at Green’s Exchange. Judging from these specimens and from verbal accounts of the mine, there is every likelihood the discovery will turn out to be highly valuable.</p>

<p>St Mary’s Kooringa. On Saturday the Sunday school scholars had their half-yearly tea. A band led the children as they marched to a large booth erected on the Company’s Paddock. At about 4 p.m. the Lord Bishop accompanied by Rev. Reid arrived from Gum Creek. After about 100 children had taken their refreshments some 200 adults enjoyed an excellent tea. The Bishop distributed prizes. While the actual number of pupils, at around 140, is not increasing, the Bishop was glad to note that attendance had been rising. The day raised £24-2-6.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]</p>
<p>The half-yearly report of the SA Mining Association covers the period to 30 September last. In that period 6,183 tons of ore was raised with an average of about 23% copper. This is within 121 tons of the quantity raised in the previous half-year and 459 tons more than the corresponding period of the preceding year. On 31 March there were 4,715 tons of ore on hand. This with the ore raised in the last half-year totals 10,899 tons. [Well 10,898 tons!]</p>
<p>Of this 4,227 tons have been delivered to the English &amp; Australian Copper Company, leaving a balance on hand of 6,672 tons. Smelted copper on hand at the end of September was 176 tons. Since then the Copper Co. has delivered 546 tons to make a total of 722 tons. Of this 551 tons has been sold in the colony and 80 tons have been exported, leaving 90 tons on hand. The price of copper sold in the colony has ranged from £95 to £105 per ton, with an average of £98-12-3. The cost of raising 5,724 tons of ore referred to in the first financial statement of the report was £12-4-4 per ton and the proceeds averaged £15-6-1 per ton, leaving a profit of £3-1-9 per ton. This is a smaller average profit than previously due to the large expenditure in exploratory work, the increasing depth of the Mine and a slight fall in the price of copper. The nett profit on the sale of this ore amounted to £17,678, which added to the balance at the date of the last report, say £60,481, together with £614 from rents etc. makes a total to the end of March last, divisible among the shareholders, of £78,773. Out of this the 34th and 35th dividends have been paid, leaving a nett ascertained balance of divisible profits of £54,133. This it is expected will be augmented to at least £77,778, but more probably to £92,133 when the ore and copper now on hand is sold and the nett return on copper now in transit has been ascertained. The values of the produce on hand and in transit have been estimated upon the last quoted price of copper in London. The August mail advised this was £107-10-0 per ton. This is the lowest price for some time and the Directors have every reason to hope that the larger sum mentioned above will be available for distribution. The Directors have declared a dividend of £5 per share [100%] will be paid on 1 December and 2 March next.</p>
<p>Captain Roach reported that a great deal of new ore ground has been opened in the last few months and the pitches are generally looking well. In driving the fifty fathom east from Waterhouse’s Shaft a lode of malachite of the richest sort and eight feet wide has been encountered. Other shafts are being sunk and efforts made to prosecute the work more vigorously. In the last two months 2,070 tons of ore were raised. Another large pumping engine has arrived at Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>Although promising, the mines at Karkulto, near Black Springs and at Pompurne near Clare, are not yet producing much ore. The company is employing 1,064 people: 1,026 at Burra, 26 at Karkulto and at Pompurne and Adelaide, 12. At the last half-yearly meeting we noted that J.B. Graham, who was visiting the colony from Frankfurt, had been made a Director. On leaving for Europe he resigned that position and at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders Mr J. Hector was elected in his place.</p>

<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel held the second Anniversary Services of the new chapel on 17 &amp; 18 October. In the morning and evening on Sunday the sermons were delivered by the President of the Conference, Rev. William Butters. In the afternoon Rev. C. Colwell preached. At the evening service 600 crowded the building, with several hundred turned away. During the evening service an Aboriginal convert called William was baptised by Rev. Butters. The collection for the day amounted to £25-1-6.</p>
<p>A very successful tea meeting was held on the Monday at which Rev. C. Colwell read the financial report showing a debt on the whole property (church, school and manse) of £1,225. The nett returns from the bazaar had been £325 and the anniversary services had raised £100, making up the noble sum of £523 [sic!]. This reduced the debt to £700.</p>

<p>News from the north is rather depressing. It is reported that Mr McDonald is returning from the new country with his sheep, having lost one horse from lack of water and another has gone astray. Mr Gregory and the men sent in quest of Mr Babbage have returned, unable to track him. It is said he went on his expedition without providing his party with horseshoes, it territory where a set of shoes lasts about ten days and horses are unable to travel without them.</p>

<p>Some of the Directors [of the Royal Mining Co.] visited their property at Karkulto last Saturday. They were well satisfied to find 10 tons of ore at grass, supposed to average more than 30%, plus about 20 tons of inferior ore. There are about 20 men at work. A party of local shareholders visited the mine on Tuesday. They report a 35% sample from the eastern side and others at 20-25%.</p>

<p>While attempting to stop a fight in Kooringa on Saturday night a policeman was badly beaten, having several teeth broken or lost and an ugly wound on the side of his head from being kicked. Rows also broke out from the arrests that followed and several of the offenders attended the court with many witnesses. Unluckily for the prisoners and the witnesses the latter so far overreached themselves that two of them have been committed for trial for perjury. There is much sympathy for the policeman, who is widely said to be the best they have had in Kooringa for a long time.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mines [Editorial]</p>
<p>[The article is a review of a general report on 12 years of the Burra Mine’s operations.]</p>
<p>The aggregate value of the ore raised in that time is stated to be £1,712,370-11-11 and the cost of production is put at £1,017,757-4-3. This means the nett profit has been £694,613-7-8 or 681⁄4%. This is an almost unparalleled return for a mining operation and has earned the Burra Mine a world-wide reputation. Of course all mines head either towards the exhaustion of the resource or at least to the point where the cost of production matches the value of the produce. From September 1850 to September 1851 24,867 tons were raised, which realised £ 242,781-15-10 and which cost in production £127,528-8-0, leaving a nett profit of £115,253-7-10. Against this in the last whole year available, March 1856 – March 1857 the ore produced was 10,961 tons, the price realised was £171,403 and the cost was £128,780, leaving a nett profit of £42, 622. The average annual nett profit for the 12 years is £57,884. The nett profit for the last whole year is thus £15,262 below that average and the last half year profit available, from March-September 1857, is £17,678, which if doubled for the year would give a nett annual profit of £35,356 or £22,528 below the 12 year average. Profit has been falling over the last 18 months despite increased amount of ore being raised. While some of this decrease is due to a fall in the price of copper, which in 1856 was £17-6-6 per ton and in the last period to £15-6-1. But more significantly the cost of production has risen from £8-13-8 per ton to £12-4-4 per ton; an increase of £3-10-8. The return shows that the nett profit over the last six months is lower than at any time in the past 12 years.</p>
<p>[The past 12 years’ results are then presented in a table.]</p>
<p>It is notable, however, that while the nett profit for the last 31⁄2 years has not equalled that of the first five years, it has exceeded that of the intermediate 31⁄2 years and it is possible that the results of the next 18 months, completing a five year period might keep up with the average.</p>

<p>Schneider’s Engine [From the Gawler correspondent.]</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of 21 December an extraordinary wain passed through Gawler on its way to the Burra Mine. It was drawn by 36 oxen and carried part of an enormous cast-iron cylinder, the weight of which is 15 tons. The wagon itself weighs 9 tons and fears were held for the timber bridge at Willaston. Estimating the weight of the bullocks at 500 lb each, the total load was 32 tons. After it came another heavy load of 170 ft of cable weighing 51⁄2 tons and this was followed by a casting similar to the first one. The bridge was not perceptibly deflected, to the relief of all parties. It is understood that the contract for fetching the enormous appliances from the ship to the Mine was £1,000. The wagons had passed the correspondent at Saddleworth on their downward journey on 9 December.</p>

<p>Burra Benevolent Board</p>
<p>On 24 December the first public meeting of the Board since its inception was held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Kooringa. The secretary reported dispensing charity to many needy individuals, among them widows and miners who had recently arrived and so did not qualify for sick pay and many others. The Board had expended £47-5-6 and still had 7/- in hand. Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson moved the adoption of the report. He expressed his satisfaction with the Board’s operation and hoped that in future charitable people would make their donations to the Board rather than see the continuation of begging lists, which were open to abuse. Mr W. Dale seconded and endorsed the remarks about begging lists being abused.</p>
<p>Elected: President, J.W. Macdonald; Treasurer, D.J.H. Ibbetson; Secretary, J.A. Stephens; Board Members, Rev. Flockart, Rev. Hillman, Rev. J.D. Whittaker &amp; Messrs Robinson, Pascal, S. Drew, J. Sleep, W.H. Challoner, Hampton T. Pryor, William Dale and Richards.</p>
<p>W. Pearce moved a vote of thanks to those who had operated the Board and also endorsed it as an improvement on the begging list system.</p>
<p>Rev. W. Flockart seconded and hoped that in the next year they would have £100 to distribute instead of the £47, [which he clearly saw as inadequate.]</p>

<p>The Christmas period passed with pleasantly cool weather and threatening thunderstorms on Christmas Day passed on. Messrs Ware and Chapman of the [Burra] Hotel had a bullock roasted near the hotel and games were played. There were wrestling, blindfolded races with wheelbarrows, jingling the bell (a variety of blind-man’s-buff), climbing a greasy pole and quoits. Mostly the games were confined to juveniles. Everything passed of quietly till the evening, when beer got the better of some, but despite a large amount of noise the interference of the police was not required.</p>

<p>There is something of a mining mania here at present, with any new discovery attracting great interest. A meeting was held at the Court House Hotel last week, to form a company to work a section taken out on a mineral lease by Messrs Fry &amp; Smith, not far from Bundaleer. 300 shares were reserved for the discoverers and 1,000 offered for sale at £2 each. All were immediately sold. A call of 5/- per share was made on Monday night and all but 130 were paid up. It is situated about three miles from the Wheal Sarah of Messrs Bath &amp; Bosance. [The correspondent thought that from personal observation it had few prospects.] Wheal Sarah had 30 tons of good ore at grass and three dray loads had been brought in to the Smelting Works. Presently it employs about 12 men. The land near the Wheal Sarah and the River Broughton Mining Company’s section is well worth exploring and if not successful for mining a large area will be opened up for agriculture.</p>

<p>Kooringa Flood. Last night (25 January) the greatest flood that has yet occurred struck Kooringa. Little rain fell before 11 p.m., but the mail driver reported passing through a heavy shower just south of the town on the Adelaide road. Shortly before 11 p.m. it began to rain heavily with thunder and lightning. The creeks coped with the run-off till near midnight, when the water began rushing down the main street. Two bullock drays, which had been left near the road, were carried through the street to the bottom. Large logs were also carried along and an immense volume of water rushed down the street to the creek. The storm reached its height at about 4 a.m. Damage has been considerable. Part of the Hotel Garden’s fence was swept away. Dr Mayne’s house was flooded to a considerable depth and valuable furniture was damaged. His stable was under water and the Shetland pony had to swim for it. Fencing and two tons of firewood were lost. Losses are put at about £200. Nearby the house of the miner named Godden was completely carried away, except for two walls. All clothing, furniture and a considerable sum of money was swept along with the water. The bridge near the Catholic Chapel was carried away and nearby houses flooded so their chairs and tables were afloat. Fred Gurney, the mail driver, rescued his wife and children and then had to leave with the mail. One side of Mr Gubbins’ house was carried away along with some of his stock. The footbridge in Kangaroo Street went next and Mr Roberts’ store was then engulfed. The waters carried away the wall around the property and one side wall of the shop, filling the cellar and inflicting about £500 damage on stores of sugar and other groceries. Mr Pearce’s fence went next, but a large stone behind one of the posts supporting the Queen Street footbridge, saved that structure. Debris from the flooded houses piled up here, diverting more water down the street. Towards the bottom of the street the shops of Stephens the carpenter and Lane the saddler bore the full force of the torrent. The side of Stephens’ shop was swept away and Lane’s shop was lifted bodily and carried 40 yards with its contents intact. Mr Lane awoke to find the house moving and leapt out of bed to be up to his body in water. In the middle of the street the depth must have been six feet. Along the Burra Creek all the bridges were carried away except the Company’s stone bridge. Many huts in the bank were flooded and the occupants were glad to have made their escape. Many will not return to them. Although the destruction of property was great, no lives were lost.</p>

On Tuesday 8 February 38 appeared in court where 35 were fined; the cutters and carters £2 each plus costs and the squatters 5/- each plus costs. This action under the Waste Lands Act offers the sheep farmers great protection, especially in a place like Burra where fuel is so in demand.</p>
<p>Wheal Sarah proprietors have taken up two more sections close to their mine, which is busy and turning out some good ore.</p>
<p>The River Broughton Mining Co. also has men at work and some nice specimens from the bottom of their shaft have been sent in.</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held today on the body of a child found in ploughing up a field in the neighbourhood. It seemed to have been there some considerable time and no clues were obtained concerning it.</p>

<p>Bush Fires</p>
<p>A public meeting, not largely attended, was held at Burra Institute on 15 February to consider ways of aiding the fund recently set up to aid sufferers from the late bush fires in the south and southeast. Mr M. Marks was voted into the chair.</p>
<p>Rev. Whittaker moved that they render every possible assistance and urge the Government to take action with as little delay as possible. He felt that as Burra was second only to Adelaide great things should be done here. Rev. Flockart seconded. He knew many of those who had suffered loss, having visited many of the homes now destroyed. The motion was carried.</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson moved that a group of collectors be established and named those collectors. G.R. Stephens seconded and the motion was carried. A sub-committee was also established to superintend the arrangements.</p>

<p>Weather. There was a dreadful dust storm at the end of last week, after which the weather has been cool and pleasant.</p>
<p>Burra Institute saw a preliminary gathering of people on Saturday evening to arrange a public meeting on Tuesday to consider ways of assisting those suffering the effects of the recent bush fires.</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson delivered the second part of his lecture on engineering, at the Institute on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Mining mania continues, though no new discoveries of significance have been reported. The visiting Directors of the River Broughton Mining Co. reported to their shareholders at the [Burra] Hotel last Friday and it was resolved to continue development.</p>
<p>Fry &amp; Smith’s new discovery has not yielded anything that has been tested, despite some reports and nothing likely to yield significantly has been seen. The only stone seen here that are likely to yield highly came from the Appealina Mine, from which some nice specimens of copper oxide were sent by the last mail.</p>

<p>Obituary. A young man called Monro, at Mt Bryan Station, cut his femoral artery while cutting up a sheep and bled to death before help could be obtained.</p>
<p>[This death seems not to have been registered unless it appears as John Munro aged 21, but his other details do not accord with the above report. His death is said to have occurred at Burra Mine on 21 February and his place of residence was Adelaide, so neither the date nor the place fit the report.]</p>
<p>Some River Broughton Mining Co. shares have changed hands at an advance and some good specimens of ore have been brought in.</p>

<p>The Governor, accompanied by Mr Blackmore, returned to Adelaide yesterday, having left last Wednesday for Gawler. From there he drove to Mr James Masters’ Saddleworth Lodge. From there he drove to auburn and thence to Mintaro, where he visited the annual exhibition of the Northern Agricultural Society and a bazaar to aid the Wesleyan Minister’s residence. He spent the afternoon at Mr Edward Bowman’s Martindale Hall. After spending the night there, he left at noon on Friday for Mr E.B. Gleeson’s at Clare. On the way he called in at Seven Hills College, where he was welcomed by Rev. Joseph Tappeiner and Rev. Pallhuber as well as one of the classes. There are at present about 22 boarders and it is intended to increase the accommodation. He also visited the chapel, garden, winehouse and cellars, managed by Mr John Schreiner. On Saturday he returned to Saddleworth Lodge. He attended Riverton Church on Sunday, where Rev. Mr Strickland conducted the service. He later drove to Gawler, where he stayed at Martin’s Railway Hotel and returned to Adelaide in time to hold an Executive Council at noon, at which Hon. E.C. Gwynne was sworn in as Third Judge of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Rev. Colwell delivered a lecture in the Wesleyan Chapel on Monday night on the Celtic Race. After the lecture a series of phantasmagorical views were exhibited by the same gentleman in the adjoining schoolroom, for the benefit of the Mission-house at Mintaro.</p>
<p>A meeting at the Burra Hotel on Monday night was held to form a company to work a mine on a section adjoining the Royal Mining Co. at Karkulto. A company was formed with 1,000 shares of £2 each, payable in instalments of 5/-, the shares were taken up that evening and another meeting will now be held to decide on how the work is to proceed. The lease is on the toll of one-twentieth for 21 years and the mine is to be called the Pinyonga.</p>
<p>A sample of ore from Wheal Sarah last week was assayed by Mr Hampton of the Copper Works at 633⁄4%.</p>

<p>A strong muster of Oddfellows was held at the Burra Hotel at 2 p.m. today to celebrate the anniversary of the foundation of the Lodge. They marched in procession to the Mine and thence through Aberdeen to Kooringa and Mr Whittaker’s Chapel where that gentleman preached a fine sermon. Dinner followed at the hotel. The procession was the largest seen in Burra. The unprecedented number of about 150 sat down to dinner. The services of Pearce’s Brass Band were in requisition all day. Though a recent band, it has improved much of late.</p>

<p>Tonight a meeting is to be held at the Aberdeen Hotel to hear the prospectus of a company to work what is to be called the North Burra Mine, located at Hallett’s Hill some 12 miles from Burra. A great many miners have invested in these two prospects.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 30 March</p>
<p>Since Signor Cutolo’s departure we have had Mr Creswick &amp; Co., who played for several nights to thin houses. Mr Gome delivered three lectures, and exhibited magic lantern views, including dissolving views, chromotropes etc.</p>
<p>The first lecture was in the Institute, the next at Mr Lamb’s [Aberdeen Hotel] and the third at the [Burra] Hotel. They were very fairly attended.</p>
<p>On Friday Mr Burton &amp; his Equestrian Troupe entered the township from Clare, and though it was 6 p.m. when the drays arrived with the tent, all was ready for a show at 8 p.m. before a crowded audience. A repetition on Saturday took place before the largest audience seen in Burra and was highly applauded.</p>
<p>The North Burra Mine is to be worked initially by a party of four. A rough sample assayed at 20% copper and a washed sample gave 45%.</p>
<p>The River Broughton Company has engaged four more miners making eight now at work and Mr John Snell has been appointed Captain.</p>
<p>A meeting of Wheal Sarah shareholders saw a further call made and the mine is being worked with vigour. The first pile of ore has been crushed and sampled and will likely be sold in a few days. A number of drays are on the road with ore from this mine.</p>

<p>On Friday the 8 April a dinner was given Mr Samuel Drew at the Burra Hotel at which 40-50 sat down. It was rather hurriedly arranged before Mr Drew’s departure on a visit to England by the mail. Festivities continued till about 2 a.m.</p>
<p>21 April 1859, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association. [Editorial]</p>
<p>The Directors affirm that this report ‘will bear favourable comparison with its predecessors. The yield of the Mine continues undiminished. The 7,423 tons of ore raised in the past six months is 1,119 tons more than the quantity raised in any six month period in the last seven years. The quality has been equal to the usual average, being from 23-24%. During the last half year the Directors have sold 604 tons of copper in the colony at an average of £98-7-0 per ton. They have sent a further 540 tons to Britain and India for sale. The cost of producing 6,304 tons of ore realised was £10-11-0 per ton. This ore sold at £13-18-4 per ton, leaving a profit of £3-7-8 per ton or 5/11 per ton more than for the preceding six months. The ascertained undivided profits of the company on 31 March last were £51,436-12-11 and the estimated profits of produced undisposed of amount to £49,494-5-11, making a total profit for division of £93,930-18-9. The Directors purpose setting apart £24,640 of the ascertained profits of the company for the payment of two dividends of £5 [100%] per share each on 1 June and 3 September next.</p>
<p>The Captain’s report is most favourable and leads to the hope that large quantities of ore will be opened in the lower levels when the new pumping engine, now in the course of erection, is got to work. The projected profits on the operations to the year ended 30 September last exceeded the best hopes of the Directors. They hoped for £38,000 and got £43,000.</p>
<p>The Company now employs 1,125 men and boys, representing a population of at least 3,000 persons, or one-fortieth of the population of the colony. This number does not include the wood-cutters and carters, or the ore carters, or those engaged by the Smelting Company. The influence of this enterprise spreads far beyond those persons mentioned above; it stimulates mercantile activity in towns and districts across the colony. The rate of wages paid by the Company ranges from £1-7-0 to £4-16-0 per week. Common labourers get the lowest figure and some of the engineers the highest. Miners obtain from 35/- to 45/- per week.</p>
<p>Mr Archibald Jaffrey was elected a Director in place of Mr Thomas Waterhouse, who has resigned his position. The four other retiring Directors, Messrs Arthur Blyth, William Peacock (Chairman), Thomas Graves and John Charles Boord, were all re-elected.</p>

<p>Business is very quiet.</p>
<p>The mining mania has subsided somewhat. Although good specimens have come in, only the Wheal Sarah has produced an appreciable amount of ore; about 30 tons of good ore coming from there.</p>
<p>A meeting of shareholders of the River Broughton Mining Co. is scheduled for tonight, when the first report of the agent will be presented.</p>
<p>A meeting of shareholders in a mining sett on the southwest boundary of the Burra Survey is to take place tonight. Parties have been sinking there for some time, in soft ground, but so far there are no signs of ore.</p>
<p>A meeting of the creditors of Mr A. Motley was held at the Burra Hotel on 18 April to hear a statement of his affairs. It is feared the estate will realize little, if anything.</p>
<p>The weather continues fine and the lack of rain has meant no visible grass on local stations and lambing has commenced. Losses are expected to be very high from lack of feed and rain. Only odd showers have fallen since the January flood.</p>

<p>Easter Holidays passed with more than the usual amusements. A game of cricket was played on Friday and also on Monday, when a cricket club was started. This could be second to none in the colony, as many of the hard-fisted miners who have become members are well used to the game.</p>
<p>On Friday there was also a hunt when C. Ware and a party of friends went out in a spring cart (tandem) on a turkey hunt on the Gum Creek Run. A flock of seven emus were surrounded and one shot and picked up. The party then got into the cart and pursued them helter-skelter over rocks, wombat holes and stones for several miles. One eventually dropped, tired. This was shot and picked up. This was repeated till five had been captured, the last one alive. Not wishing to tire the horses further, they them went to the Cross Roads Inn. Here two horsemen went off to capture the last two; one of which was taken alive. The two live ones are now at the Burra Hotel, where Mr Ware is attempting to tame them.</p>
<p>On Monday the annual races took place at the Dry Hill, or Cross Roads, when all who were not engaged at cricket or at the Wesleyan Sunday School tea meeting, were assembled. There was a good turnout. There was also a procession of the Redruth Tradesmen and Miners’ Club, who afterwards took part in a dinner at the Court House Hotel.</p>
<p>A branch of the National Bank of Australasia was opened here this week in premises lately occupied by Mr Leon. It is likely to do well, as they are very willing to accommodate the tradespeople here, who in turn, once they become accustomed to it, will do all their business there. A number of accounts have already been opened.</p>

<p>On 30 May Mr Selwyn, the Government Geologist for Victoria, and Mr Goyder, the Assistant Surveyor General, visited the Burra. After an inspection of the surface of the Mine they applied for permission to go below, but were refused because they brought no order from the Directors, although one had been promised. The next day they continued for the Eastern Plains to Noorkongoree or Hell’s Gates (Mr Chewings’). After examining the country they came down by Hallett’s Hill, Mt Bryan and thence to Canowie to the Broughton and Messrs Bath &amp; Bosance’s mine, and also where a recent claim for a gold discovery has been made. They will then proceed north to mines there.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held today before J.W. Macdonald at the Miners’ Arms on the body of Alex. McDonald. W. Pearce was foreman. The body had been found in the creek leading from Queen Street to Chapel Street. John Chirgwin said he had found the body at about 6.15 a.m. Sunday. He called to Mr Drake, who was passing at the time, and together they turned the body over before one went for a doctor and the other for the police. The deceased was lying on his face with his mouth and nostrils full of sand. Henry Drake gave corroborative evidence. There were no signs of a struggle.</p>
<p>Martin Banin had been arrested on the information of James Rule. Both Banin and the deceased had been in Rule’s company early on the morning of McDonald’s death. Henry Anderson said he had seen the deceased at about 1 or 2 a.m. at Anderson’s home. Banin and the deceased had not quarrelled. Banin lodged with Anderson and did not leave when the deceased did. Rule left about ten minutes later.</p>
<p>Dr L.J. Maurau said there were no marks of violence on the body, such as might be caused by a fall into the creek, which where the body was found was about 15 feet deep. He believed death was caused by a broken neck.</p>
<p>James Rule was called, but was so intoxicated that he was locked up. Other witnesses agreed that Banin and the deceased were on good terms and that Banin had not left his lodgings that night. Rules suspicions seem to be based only on the fact that upon seeing the body Banin had said that, ‘he had not done that’.</p>
<p>The verdict was of accidental death caused by falling over the bank of the creek while under the influence of liquor.</p>
<p>[The death is registered as Alexander McDonnell, died 5 June 1859, Kooringa Creek aged 28.]</p>

<p>On 13 June, Whit Monday, two elevens of the Burra Cricket Club played a game. The Tradesmen batted first in bad weather. A heavy drizzle was right in their faces and as a result they managed only 26, including byes. The Miners then batted in fine conditions and scored 76. The Tradesmen scored 73 in their second innings; mainly due to James Wilson’s 47. The Miners got the 26 [sic] to win with 5 or six wickets in hand. Stephen Thomas was the highest scorer on the winning side, with 44 n.o.</p>

<p>Having had occasion to travel lately, I must call attention to the abominable state of the Main North Road, about two miles on the Adelaide side of the Light Bridge and also another section of a few hundred yards, two miles closer to Adelaide. Both are between fences, and cut up to a depth of about two feet, so that it is only with difficulty that any vehicle can be dragged through. I saw two of the Copper Company’s drays stuck there last week, though with light loads and double teams. ‘It is strange that while the Willunga, Mount Barker and other roads are metalled throughout, this one should have patches left in a state of nature, although five times more wealth passes over it than is conveyed on the above mentioned roads.’</p>

<p>The Anti-Butchers Society seems to be working well. The managers have so much business that they need three carts to convey the meat to the customers, but not at 3d per pound as some Adelaide people believe, but at 1d per pound less than the butchers. The present scarcity of cattle and their high price does not allow for then to sell lower. None of the stockholders will imitate the conduct of Captain R. Goldsworthy, who sold them their first cattle and then made them a handsome donation out of the money paid.</p>

But he reports more copper will be made this year than in the past. The present stock of fuel guarantees this barring some extraordinary accident. Cartage has remained brisk for the past four weeks. Shipments of ore had been about 1,000 tons and might reach 1,800 tons before the season closes.

<p>A Shareholder of Kooringa writes condemning recent mining regulations, which seem based on the assumption that all mines are as profitable as the great Burra Burra. In fact that ignores the great expenditure in the colony on mines that have failed to be productive. Mining needs to be encouraged as the export of ores is the principal stay of the colony. That it has recently been declared by some MPs that certain leases granted eight or nine months ago are illegal, is also a concern that will create unease and lead to a halt in investment. Wheal Sarah proprietors will certainly refrain from further investment and if the Government demands the surrender of the lease, they will sue the original proprietors for compensation and they in turn will sue the Government for issuing an incorrect lease.</p>

<p>A young child has been lost at Baldina. A child of a wood cutter named Campbell was sent to its father about 300 yards away where he was cutting wood. It never arrived and has not been found despite intensive searches from Thursday to Sunday. It cannot be doubted that it has perished in the bitterly cold and frosty nights.</p>
<p>[No corresponding death was registered. John Stuart Campbell born to Charles Campbell and Mary Ann nee Wilson 6 December 1856 at Redruth is a possibility. There is no registration of his death, but the same couple had another John Stuart Campbell born 6 September 1869 at Allens Creek, suggesting that the first child was dead by then. This is also confirmed by a letter on the subject by the child’s father; see 29 July 1859 page 3]</p>
<p>On Friday a meeting of leaseholders of Kooringa took place in the Mechanics’ Institute to consider a circular sent to a number of them by the Board of Directors of the SA Mining Association calling upon leaseholders to consider the propriety of forming a Corporation to take on the management of the streets and roads of the township under their care, as they sadly wanted repair. The circular also stated that the Board was prepared to renew leases upon liberal terms. Dr Mayne was called to the chair and read the circular to the meeting. A committee was formed to learn what the liberal terms were and to communicate them to a meeting.</p>

<p>The township better known to old colonists as the ‘Stone Hut’ is beginning to show signs of enterprise and improvement. If the contemplated trunk railway is built along the Gilbert, a consummation devoutly to be wished by the inhabitants of the township and district, an impetus will be given to develop the resources of the beautiful agricultural country surrounding it. Among improvements are the stores built by Messrs Sanderson and Campion. The former is a handsome stone structure fronting the main road to the Burra. The latter is also substantial and though not presenting so neat an appearance to the eye as Mr Sanderson’s, is equally well fitted for its purpose.</p>

<p>Charles Campbell writes to correct some details in the report of his child’s disappearance at Baldina. The child was in the habit of leaving the tent between 9 and 10 a.m. and coming 300 yards to where his father was cutting wood. On Thursday he left as usual and when he failed to return as quickly as usual his mother came looking for him. Campbell and his friend working with him searched till evening and then let the neighbours know. A search was kept up all night. On Friday the police were notified and the search continued through the night. On Saturday and Sunday 25 to 30 of the Company’s men searched all day. On Saturday evening one of the police came as far as the mule camp 10-12 miles from Burra and about 4 miles from where the child was lost. He was told a large party was searching and then returned to Burra.</p>

<p>The Burra Benevolent Board called a meeting at the Institute to consider the destitution existing in Burra and the means of addressing it, but so few attended that the meeting was abandoned.

<p>Mr Hudson gave two entertainments at the Burra Hotel last Saturday and Monday, which were but thinly attended considering the superior nature of the treat offered.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a meeting of the inhabitants was held at the Burra Hotel to consider the answer received from the Directors of the SA Mining Association relative to forming a Corporation to improve their township. The ‘liberal terms’ were that leases would be renewed for 31 years from the expiration of the current leases at an annual rental of half the annual value of the land with the improvements thereon. It was resolved that they could not entertain the idea of forming a Corporation to tax themselves in order to improve what is the Mining Company’s property, unless far more liberal terms were offered. A committee was appointed to correspond with the Directors in an attempt to get more liberal terms. Everyone seems convinced that there is no hope of getting a Corporation formed and are preparing themselves by getting allotments at Redruth and Aberdeen, especially as the railway terminus is expected to be there and consequently all the trade that it will generate.</p>

<p>A meeting was held at the [Burra] Hotel on Monday to hear the response of the Directors to the proposition sent to them from a former meeting relative to forming a Corporation in the township. The Directors replied that they could not see their way clear to valuing the allotments according to their position rather than according to the improvements thereon. Neither could they do away with the restriction on the number of public houses in the township. They would negotiate with individual tenants on the renewal of leases on the terms proposed in the former letter. There being no basis for any negotiation, the meeting decided to take no action and the question of a Corporation is taken as settled.</p>

The members met at the lodge room in Lamb’s Aberdeen hotel at 3 o’clock and preceded by the Kooringa Band marched through Kooringa to the Bible Christian Chapel, where Rev. Way gave a fine address on ‘Brotherly Love’. A fine dinner followed at the Aberdeen Hotel. [The toasts are reported.] The lodge had spent six months getting organised and in the second six months 60 members had joined to bring the total to 100. More than £77 had been paid to the District Office, sick brethren and other expenses and now they had £150 in hand. No other lodge in the colony had made such progress and much was due to V.G. Corey, who had proposed by far the greatest number of members.</p>

<p>Last Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday a grand bazaar was held in the Institute in aid of the proposed Anglican Church at Redruth. Monday was very well attended, but unpropitious weather reduced attendance on the other two days. About £300 was raised, from which about £42 must be deducted for expenses. This result was far better than expected given the dull state of trade in the town. Many had predicted failure.</p>
<p>On Thursday the foundation stone of the church was laid by the Lord Bishop, assisted by Dean Farrell before a large crowd despite inclement weather. A large tea-party was held in St Mary’s Schoolroom in the evening.</p>

Five miles north of Hamilton the horse stumbled and Colley was thrown, breaking an arm. He was unable to move and remained there until a dray, coming from Kapunda, picked him up. It returned with him and the mail to Hamilton, from which the mail was eventually forwarded. Meanwhile the cart was repaired, but suffered four further breakdowns before finally getting away.</p>

<p>The second AGM was held on Friday 30 September Mr Morris Marks took the chair and Secretary Rev. Ibbetson read the report. The average attendance of boys for instruction was 15. There were 153 members, comprising 20 life members, 5 ten-year members and 128 ordinary members and of these 43 have joined in the last year. There are 470 books in the library and £70 has been sent to England to purchase more. The average attendance in the reading room has been 93 per month. The accounts show a balance in hand of £52-3-0, but as yet the Institute is not self-supporting. Members’ subscriptions pay only the costs of lighting and heating. Elected were: Trustees, Mr Elphick &amp; Dr Maurau (replacing Rev. T. Wright and Rev. T. Hillman); and for the committee Messrs J.A. Bruce, Andrew Thomas, Captain Bryant, William Batchelor &amp; William Dale, J. Lynne &amp; J.R. Stephens as auditors and N. Oldham as Treasurer.

<p>Accident/Obituary. On Thursday last a young man named Henry Marks lost his life at the Burra Mine. He was employed in raising a pass in one of the pitches at the 30 fathom level, where a quantity of addle had been put to fill up some of the pitches that had been worked out. While so engaged the earth gave way and completely buried him. It took from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. to recover the body. An inquest was held. He was a steady sober young man, unmarried and a class-leader in the Primitive Methodist Chapel.</p>

<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel held its Anniversary Services on Sunday. Sermons were preached by Rev. Harcourt of Norwood and Rev. James Lyall (Presbyterian) of Adelaide. Congregations were large. The collections were made to aid the trust fund and also to build a gallery in the chapel to increase its seating. The Monday tea meeting was most numerously attended. The public meeting was also largely attended and the balance sheet showed a great increase in the amount collected. An appeal was made for funds to erect a gallery. Mr Colton headed it with a donation of £5-5-0, as also did Mr Padman, with Messrs Ballantyne, Young and Bray contributing in proportion.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association Half-Yearly Report [Editorial]</p>
<p>The report was issued at the meeting on 19 October. The yield of ore for the last six months has been large and the average price has been good. The expected profit will be less than in previous years because the extended workings of the mine require expenditure on improvements of a permanent nature. This should in the near future be balance by increased output. The deeper workings require the employment of more men, thus increasing the wages bill. Extra men have had to be employed in repairs, exploring new ground, sinking a new engine shaft and other works of a permanent nature, which though necessary do not yield ore. There has also been large expenditure on a new and powerful pumping engine. Though this statement applies to the year ending 30 September 1859, the financial report does not come down to a later date than 30 September 1858.</p>
<p>Comparison of two half-years:</p>
<p>The report for the half-year ending 30 September 1858 showed a balance of £57,435-14-11 applicable to dividends, to which must be added the profits arising from operations of 1859.</p>
<p>In the last six months 6,591 tons of ore were raised; 832 tons less than for the previous six months. The estimated yield was 22-23%. 743 tons of copper sold in Adelaide realised an average of over £100 per ton. The general quoted price in London was £107-10-0. Unsold produce is equal to 1,358 tons of fine copper, which if sold at present rates would produce a profit of £23,531-18-11 to add to the balance from 1858 to make a gross profit of £80,967-13-10. From this the Directors have set apart a sum of £24,640 for two dividends of 100% (£5 per £5 share) to be paid on 3 December and 3 March next.</p>
<p>The Captain’s reports show continued discoveries of rich ore.</p>

<p>The recent revivals among the three Methodist groups in Burra seem to have influenced others as well. The Germans have resolved upon finishing their chapel, the foundation stone of which was laid with Masonic honours some eight or nine years ago and which could not be completed when the Victorian gold diggings drew away the population. It promises to be a handsome structure near the Redruth Court House.</p>

Edwards and the Chairman. Mr Dale spoke for over an hour on the immigration question and urged the necessity of getting written pledges from candidates not to vote any money for that purpose. A motion to that effect was passed unanimously. The other speakers spoke in support of the same matter. The meeting was numerously attended.</p>

<p>A.H. Forder of Redruth wrote thanking the Board for an increased stipend. In another letter he applied for a renewal of his teacher’s licence for the current year. He says a new school is to be opened by Mr Motley.</p>
<p>A decrease in his own school was therefore expected, but he hoped to retain his pupils by a diligent attention to his duties and he did not think any great permanent injury would result.</p>
<p>Mr Arthur Motley wrote seeking a form to apply for a teacher’s licence for himself and his wife. He intended to use the Primitive Methodist Chapel at Redruth and his application was incidental to Mr Forder’s probable resignation. He was able to produce testimonials.

<p>Political Meeting</p>
<p>A meeting was held at the Burra Hotel on Monday evening to allow Mr Kingston to address the electors. Mr E.B. Gleeson was voted into the chair. Mr Kingston said he was pleased to be a candidate for the fourth time. He thanked the 300 electors who had signed a requisition asking him to stand. He recounted for newcomers to the colony his role in the passage of the Constitution Act for SA and the establishment of a liberal form of Government in place of the old nominee system. He claimed a role in getting the vote for all over 21 instead of the previous £10 franchise and for the introduction of the secret ballot, free from intimidation, though to his knowledge no such intimidation had ever been practised. Indeed men had voted against him and continued to be employed at the Mine until they left of their own accord. He also claimed credit for the system of mineral leases now in operation to the benefit of the miners. Now discoverers of mines could obtain a lease, whereas before they had to compete with anyone else at an auction to buy the land. The advantage was clear from the recent sale of one of their leases by Messrs Chambers &amp; Finke for £40,000. He then turned to a discussion of the sale of agricultural land. He advocated a deposit of 50% at auctions; this would do much to eliminate land sharks who, having paid a small deposit, immediately went out and sold at a premium before they had to meet the rest of the payment. He also spoke in support of Mr Torrens’ Real Property Act as being a great benefit to those purchasing real estate. Mr Dale asked if he was in favour of payment of Members of Parliament. He was not.</p>
<p>He was also opposed to Government aid for schools where doctrinal teaching was given, having helped to abolish state aid to religion.</p>
<p>A motion declaring Kingston a fit and proper candidate for election was proposed by Mr T. Bath and was negatived by a large majority.</p>
<p>Mr Dale was called upon to address the meeting. After some hesitation he did so. He questioned Mr Kingston’s success in serving the community. Where was the Redruth Bridge? Having received £1,900 during the last three years as payment in the House, his opposition to payment for Members seemed inconsistent. Kingston now said he opposed immigration, but this conversion had only happened when it was clear the electors would support it no longer. What had he done for the District? He had opposed railway extension. True he had supported the new constitution, manhood suffrage and the ballot, but he also supported the gagging clause and the obnoxious Militia Act. Dale also complained of Kingston’s support for the Mineral Leases, which had detrimental effects as well as advantages for some, for unfair impounding regulations and unfair taxation. Mr Dale said great partiality had been shown to the squatter.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting Mr Barnden proposed that Messrs Dale, Lennon and Cole were each fit and proper candidates and each proposition was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Political Meeting at Kooringa</p>
<p>On Friday 16 March a public meeting at Kooringa to hear of the views of Messrs Dale, Lennon &amp; Cole; candidates in the forthcoming election. Mr James Wright of Clare was the Chairman. He referred to a dispute between Mr Lennon and Mr Gleeson in which Mr Lennon had said people in Clare had applied in vain for land to be surveyed and put up for auction. Mr Wright said he knew that none had been put up in the last 12 months that any middle-class man might bid for.</p>
<p>Mr Lennon repeated this. In 12 months not an acre had been put up for sale west or north of Clare fit for either agriculture of mining.</p>
<p>Mr Dale said the dispute had arisen because Mr Kingston had said anyone could claim to have any portion of Crown Lands surveyed and put up for sale. Mr Lennon had so applied without result. Mr Gleeson had said land had been offered, but had not been taken up.</p>
<p>No questions came from the meeting and so Mr Cole was called to speak.</p>
<p>He advocated the cessation of immigration; his long term position and not a response to popular opinion lately arising. He questioned the running of the Public Works Department and also asked why one of the judges did not visit Redruth for Circuit Sessions. He sought action to reduce the operations of land sharks. He supported free trade and free ports and direct taxation. He supported education, thinking the Government should assist remote areas. He favoured the payment of members.</p>
<p>The motion that Messrs Coles, Lennon &amp; Dale were fit and proper candidates was passed without dissension.</p>
<p>An attempt to declare Dr Browne a fit and proper candidate was met with interruptions of contempt and derision and failed to gain support.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 28 March</p>
<p>Election Day at Kooringa saw a contest between the champions of the Political Association, Messrs Dale, Cole and Lennon and their opponents Messrs Kingston, Browne and Cullen. The Burra Hotel was the chief polling place and was much frequented throughout the day. Polling closed at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>All Saturday the chief topic of conversation was the result. On Monday the scrutineers came and plied their task for hour after hour, while outside numbers of people waited for the result. This eventually revealed that the Political Association had won an overwhelming majority. Yesterday there was a goodly gathering when the returning officer declared Messrs Dale, Cole and Lennon duly elected members for the District of Burra and Clare.</p>
<p>‘The result is regarded with much regret by the more sober-minded and thinking portion of the community, who cannot but see the evil of sending men to Parliament merely because they happen to possess a popular species of oratory which wins the public ear, or because they profess political opinions in accordance with the views of the majority.’</p>

<p>‘A Burra Elector’ writes from Kooringa 2 April re the election.</p>
<p>A recent communication from your Kooringa correspondent contains the following extraordinary statement:</p>
<p>‘The result [i.e. the return by an overwhelming majority of Messrs Dale, Cole and Lennon] is regarded with much regret by the more sober-minded and thinking portion of the community, who cannot but see the evil of sending men to Parliament merely because they happen to possess a popular species of oratory which wins the public ear, or because they profess political opinions in accordance with the views of the majority.’</p>
<p>May I ask on what authority he asserts ‘the more sober-minded and thinking portion of the community’ regards the results with regret and sees the evil of sending men into Parliament who possess the qualification acknowledged by your correspondent? The paragraph I have quoted is an insult to the electors of Kooringa in inferring that three-fourths of them are not sober-minded or thinking men.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association 15th Annual Report [Editorial]</p>
<p>The 15th annual report will be presented to shareholders next Wednesday. Despite the title of the Association, its activities are virtually confined to the Burra Burra Mines. The operations at the Pompurne Mine have been discontinued and a loss of upwards of £1,230 written of in the company’s ledger on account of that venture. At the Karkulto Mine, from which so much was expected, and into which so much investment has been made, work continues, but we understand that here too the Directors are likely soon to advise that it is to the company’s advantage to cease operations. After 15 years then the Association is virtually left solely to rely upon the Burra Burra Mine. The Directors do not seemed disheartened however, and have secured leases of mineral lands in the north adjoining the sections of the Great Northern Mining Company and apparently they intend in the near future to test the value of their property there.</p>
<p>The quantity of ore raised in the last six months was 6,924 tons of about 22-23% copper. Nearly 1,000 tons of copper have been sold in Adelaide at £100 per ton. A still higher price is now being realised. The cost of producing the ore has been £12-5-8 per ton in the last half-year. The nett amount realised was £14-14-0, leaving a profit of £2-8-4 per ton. This is not as favourable as 12 months ago, when the profit per ton was £3-7-8. The cost of raising ore has risen due to deeper workings, more machinery, greater timbering and various other factors. The Directors are investigating ways of reducing the costs associated with ore dressing. They are looking at further machinery to cut costs.</p>
<p>The entire expenditure in the last half-year was £80,881-6-9 and the nett proceeds of ore raised were £96,796-3-7. The entire amount to credit in the profit and loss accounts is £74,259-13-6. Against this must be placed the aggregate amount for the 40th and 41st dividends of £24,640 and a further sum of equal amount, which the Directors have deemed it necessary to transfer to stock account to represent the additional inconvertible property of the Association. These sums, together with the losses on working the Pompurne Mine, reduce the balance available for dividends to 31 March to £23,748-15-1. As a result the Directors have proposed to declare one dividend of 100% in the current half year. It is necessary to note that a further profit of £22,158-15-7 will be realised on copper and ore raised, but not yet sold. Thus the shareholders have no great reason to feel dissatisfied, despite there being only one dividend and that of only 200% per annum on their original investment.</p>

<p>Fire at the Burra Mine</p>
<p>On Saturday 14 April there was much excitement in the town as the news spread that there was a fire at the Mine and lives had been lost. Unfortunately this proved to be all too true. Although the fire was speedily brought under control two miners lost their lives. ‘The cause of the fire was the accidental leaving of a lighted candle close to the timber-work in the 25 fathom level of the mine, which is perfectly dry, no water having risen so high for a considerable period.’</p>
<p>The telegrams sent between Captain Roach and Henry Ayers are printed.</p>
<p>The first at 9.40 from Roach says Roach discovered the fire in Stocks’ and Graham’s Shafts when he rose at 6 a.m. He sent a captain and men below and they discovered fire at the 25 fathom level. He advises they were doing their best to extinguish the fire and he hopes no lives are lost.</p>
<p>At 9.50 a.m. he advises ‘Two men dead; two nearly suffocated, but hope they will recover.’</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. Ayers asked to be kept informed.</p>
<p>At 11.19 a.m. Roach advised: ‘The fire fast abating. Mine in great excitement. Crowds witnessing the scene.’</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. ‘The fire is nearly extinct. I hope the worst is over, but exceedingly regret the loss of the two poor men who were killed. I think the fire must have arisen from the men having left a lighted candle next to the timber in the level last night by accident and not intentionally.’</p>
<p>At 3.20 p.m. he is able to give a little more detail, to name the deceased and mention Captain Goldsworthy’s narrow escape, as well as report that the inquest has been held and adjourned to Tuesday.</p>
<p>At 4.50 p.m. Roach sent the telegram:</p>
<p>‘Impossible to say what is the underground damage. Five shafts are stopped up and less smoke is issuing. Two men, Pryor and Johns are dead. An inquest has been held and adjourned till Tuesday. The fire is not general, being confined to the old workings near Stock’s [sic] Shaft.’</p>
<p>On 16 April at 10.20 a.m. Roach sends: ‘Hope the fire is nearly extinguished. Only steam and gas coming from where the fire was. Most of the men have taken their place this morning, but a little timid.</p>
<p>Ayers replied seeking clarification of the extent of the workings damaged.</p>
<p>At 1.40 p.m. Roach replied: ‘The injury done to the mine is not worth mentioning – only stopping two or three pitches for a few days until they get cold.’</p>
<p>While the event is much to be regretted, it should at the same time be remembered that the Burra has hitherto enjoyed an immunity from accidents of any kind to an extent which has perhaps never characterised equally large mines in other countries.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>On Saturday 14 April the town was thrown into alarm by the news that the Mine was on fire and some of the miners were burnt and suffocated. Soon many people flocked to the scene of the disaster. The scene bore a very serious aspect, though some of the reports had been rather exaggerated. A great number had gathered around one of the shafts where two men named Thomas Pryor and Peter Johns had been brought to the surface, dead. Nearby two dense columns of smoke ascended from Stocks’ and Graham’s Shafts. Several other men had very narrow escapes. Mark Mitchell was quite delirious when rescued and Captain Goldsworthy, who went down with some men to try to extinguish the fire, nearly suffered the same fate. Men were then sent in search of others who might be in danger, but so far no more have been found.</p>
<p>At about noon the same day an inquest was held at the Mine Hospital on the bodies of the two deceased miners before Mr Macdonald SM with Captain Killicoat as foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>William Dunstan identified the men.</p>
<p>About 9 a.m. was at work in the mine when it became known some men were missing. Went in search of them in the 20 fathom and found two, Mark Mitchell and John Tresona, who were much exhausted and unable to speak. Went to another level to seek the other pair, but did not find them. Returned to the plat and found them there dead. They had been found by others while I was away. Knew nothing of the origin of the fire.</p>
<p>John Allen:</p>
<p>I and several others were sent to search for any men that might be underground. At the 20 fathoms I went aside from Graham’s Shaft and found Mitchell &amp; Tresona. Mitchell was alive and I brought him to the plat. Returned for Tresona who was lying down unable to speak. Then met a man called Bucket and we went in search of others. We found Pryor with whom I remained on the plat. Don’t know who found Johns. There was much smoke in the place and I consider that the cause of their death. There was smoke coming up the shaft in quantity. I believe the deceased went down to try to extinguish the fire, not to their regular work. Do not know the origin of the fire. Smoking was common in the Mine, but that would not set fire to it. The fire was in Stocks’ Shaft and the men were in Graham’s about 40 fathoms distant. Did not see smoke below the 20 fathom level. When I took Pryor up he only gasped once. Johns was dead when I saw him.</p>
<p>William Mitchell</p>
<p>At about 6.30 a.m. came from underground when my attention was attracted by smoke coming out of a whip-shaft and a whim-shaft. Went to see what it was. It seemed to be burning timber below. I had again to go down Graham’s Shaft to the 30. When I and others were sitting on the plat I said if smoke came down to the 30 we would work in the 50 to escape it. Just as we were about to start work the order was given to leave off work. Took the ladder to the 20, but the smoke was too thick and so I went around another way. I was then sent to search for the men supposed to be down there. When I reached below some men were bringing Mitchell to the plat. John Jenkins then came for help to recover Peter Johns. The fire began in the pitch belonging to Richard Glanvill, John Tenby and William Snell. Saw them on the surface at 7 o’clock.</p>
<p>Thomas Hosking</p>
<p>Saw smoke ascending from a ship and whim shaft. Went to change my clothes and while doing so Thomas Mitchell came for me to go down with him. Went to Stocks’ 25 and saw a body of fire. Commenced to build a dam to cut off the grass from the fire, but we were soon driven from the place by smoke and had to run for our lives. Several went with me then to the 30 and thence to the 20, Graham’s. There we heard the cries of Captain Goldsworthy and a man named Hodge. Caught Captain Goldsworthy’s hand and brought him out to the ladder road and returned for Hodge. Went looking for more but was forded to the surface by smoke. Five of us were ordered down again to search for men. About two or three fathoms beyond Graham’s I saw Mark Mitchell and John Tresona. Mitchell was sitting on the plat. Took him back to the first man I saw and returned for Tresona who was lying on his face. I carried him to the shaft and went in search of any others. Searched all the levels in the 20 and found none, before going to Graham’s Shaft where the two deceased had been brought to the plat. We bound them up as well as we could and sent them up in the gig. I am a timberman and have no idea how the fire started. Was not in that part of the mine yesterday and never saw fires below in the Mine. The fire began in Glanvill’s pitch. There was a body of fire. I was near it. I never knew a mine so well ventilated as the Burra Mine. Believe the deceased were suffocated by the smoke.</p>
<p>Dr Maurau:</p>
<p>Was called to the mine about 9 o’clock. Saw John Tresona who was sitting in the Captain’s office. He was recovering from the effects of partial suffocation. Ordered him home in a cart. (Produced a certificate from Dr Mayne that Tresona was unable to attend.) Saw Captain Goldsworthy who was recovering. Saw Mark Mitchell who had just been brought up and was recovering. Went to Graham’s Shaft and saw the bodies of Pryor and Johns who must have been dead for some time. The cause of death in each instance was suffocation by smoke.</p>
<p>Richard Glanvill:</p>
<p>Worked the 25 fathom level in Stocks’ Shaft and left at 7 o’clock yesterday evening. William Blackney was with me below. Was employed wheeling stuff for Blackney, to fill in the bucket. I took care to clear away anything that might cause fire and left no candle burning. There was no one in the pitch when we left. The fire will be a loss to us by damaging the pitch and preventing our working. The pitch was not a good one; we were making wages and that was all. There were some men working below our pitch. The fire occurred nine fathoms from the shaft. Neither of us used tobacco. I do not know where the deceased were working or where they were found.</p>
<p>William Blackney [Gave corroborative evidence] and then: I am certain we brought up our candles. The other candles used were extinguished. I did not keep any matches below. The candle we used in working was stuck up against the timber, but there was no fire when we left.</p>
<p>James Pryor:</p>
<p>I was with my brother, the deceased, at the time of the accident this morning. I left my brother and five men in the level while I went to help stop the smoke. [After about five minutes they were forced to crawl out on hands and knees.]</p>
<p>The coroner then ruled that although the cause of death had been determined for the two deceased, it was highly desirable that the cause of the fire be established and so he adjourned the inquiry until noon on Tuesday 17 April.</p>
<p>[Thomas Prior died 21 April 1860 at Burra Mine residence Redruth aged 24.</p>
<p>Peter Johns died 21 April 1860 at Burra Mine residence Kooringa aged 37.]</p>

<p>Resumed Inquest at Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Captain Roach:</p>
<p>At about 6 a.m. Saturday he saw smoke coming from one of the shafts, which he thought was Stocks’. Went to see the problem. Soon after Captain Mitchell and a man named Lewis went down and subsequently Captains Bryant and Goldsmith and a number of men went down to try to extinguish the fire. Soon afterwards Captain Mitchell returned to say there was a dire at the 25 fathom level in Stocks’ Shaft. He believed the fire to be accidental. In his experience there he had known of one fire in a copper mine in Columbia. Its origin was unknown. The timber was very dry in Stocks’ Shaft and though he believed the fire to be out, he was afraid to open the shafts yet. He did not think they could examine the locality of the fire for several days. A candle left carelessly might be a cause. He had found timber burning from a candle more than once and had even found a candle on a powder can. He had every confidence in the miners whose pitch had been the source. The two deceased had gone from their place of work to help extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>Captain Mitchell:</p>
<p>[Gave a similar account to Captain Roach with variations on his underground activities.]</p>
<p>He thought a candle left behind the most likely cause. Some months before he and Captain Bryant had found a candle burning against timber and it had taken them some time to extinguish it. The fire was where the men had been working. He had been in Stocks’ Shaft about 8 p.m. the night before and there was no sign of fire then, though there might have been a fire in Glanvill’s pitch without his perceiving it. Potter and others were working in the 20 fathom level about 30 fathoms distant from Glanvill’s pitch. They left work about 9 p.m. and passed over Glanvill’s pitch without smelling fire. A man called Penno and others were working in the 30 fathom level and left work at 7 a.m. Saturday. As they passed over Glanvill’s pitch they heard a roaring noise. Captain Roach had discovered the fire before they got to the surface.</p>
<p>Robert Penno:</p>
<p>When he heard the roaring at the plat he went towards it and saw the fire. He had observed nothing when he went down.</p>
<p>Dr Maurau was recalled:</p>
<p>Though the cause of death of Pryor and Johns was commonly called suffocation, it was more properly asphyxiation. The former suggests some physical obstruction to the lungs and the latter the breathing of poisoned air. He believed they were dead for at least an hour before they reached the surface. They had been taken to the hospital and washed with warm water that would have helped to revive them. Their pupils were dilated and suggested the inhalation of carbonic acid gas.</p>
<p>The jury found death was due to the effects of a fire in the Burra Mine, which originated from some unknown cause. They also praised the men who risked their lives endeavouring to save their fellow-miners and in extinguishing the fire.</p>
<p>20 April 1860, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 18 April</p>
<p>The recent fatal accident at the Mine has been the principal interest and theme of discussion here. When the news reached the town on Saturday morning many went to the Mine and many anxious wives and mothers waited for news of those below. At length two were brought up death and others in a precarious state; one delirious and another insensible, with others affected by smoke and noxious fumes to varying degrees. An inquest was held on the bodies of the deceased at noon on Saturday, but then adjourned to yesterday (Tuesday). The jury returned a verdict of accidental death and expressed admiration for the courage of those who risked their lives endeavouring to rescue the deceased and to extinguish the fire.</p>

<p>Kooringa Local Court, Monday</p>
<p>On Saturday a pair of inebriated Aborigines went to Mr Custerphon’s house near Kooringa and demanded money, drink and ‘tuck-out’. Mrs Custerphon was alone at the time and refused to comply. The Aborigines than tried to force the door and broke a window, as the same time uttering threats. Mrs Custerphon escaped through a back door to her husband who was working in an outbuilding some distance away. As she fled one threw a spear at her, but missed. Mr Custerphon ordered them off, but they refused to leave, so he got out a gun and fired into the ground near them. They still stood their ground so he wounded on in the posterior with a slight charge of shot. The police then arrived and took them into custody. The police are endeavouring to find where the offenders obtained the means of intoxication. The trial has been adjourned to Saturday to allow the attendance of the wounded native.</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Mine Engine is again pumping its stream of water into the huge reservoir in the creek between Redruth and Aberdeen. The dam across the creek, which was swept away by the last flood, is again being banked up. We may expect that in a few weeks the ford will be impassable and travellers between Aberdeen and Redruth will have to detour around by the smelting works and across the bridge. Why has the bridge so long talked of not been erected?</p>

<p>The people who supplied the natives with liquor (as mentioned in the Register 27 April) were discovered and upon it being proved were fined £5 plus costs.</p>
<p>The case against the two Aborigines was adjourned to Monday, when ‘Jim Crack’, the one who was wounded and who had thrown the spear, was sentenced to three months in gaol and the other was sentenced to one week’s incarceration.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra Company is digging a trench to carry off the water from the Bon Accord engine, so that the ford will remain operational at least until the winter rains bring floods.</p>
<p>Despite warnings from the Snowy River diggings that winter there is severe, several miners have left for there recently and many more are preparing to follow in spring.</p>

<p>‘North’ writes, 3 May 1860,</p>
<p>Why does the Northern Railway carry goods for the Burra Company as far as Section 112 when it will not take other freights? There is much produce that has to go from here to Adelaide, but on account of high freight charges and the scarcity of cattle, the settlers are unable to get it to Gawler. If the railways can take copper and coals from section 112, it ought to take other goods.</p>

<p>A Woodcarters’ Meeting was held on Saturday 12 May to petition the Government to repeal the obnoxious clauses of the mew timber-licence regulations.</p>
<p>Mr A. Motley was elected to the chair. He said the imposition of a £5 licence for woodcarters would drive many off the road. Consumers would certainly feel the impact.</p>
<p>Mr Nankervis moved that the imposition of a £5 licence was tantamount to a stoppage of their trade. Carried.</p>
<p>The chairman then commented on other oppressive clauses of the Act: special permission to cut wood on any particular portion of Crown Lands and the restriction of cutters to a specified locality. They needed various localities to suit the wood to customers’ needs.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgerald moved that these restrictions were oppressive.</p>
<p>A discussion followed involving Mr James, Mr Dale MP, &amp; Mr Tigganz.</p>
<p>Mr Stapleton James proposed the organising of a memorial to the Government. Carried.</p>
<p>The chairman read the draft of a memorial and Mr J. Bull proposed its adoption, seconded by Mr Briar and carried. [The text of the memorial is printed.]</p>
<p>Mr S. James proposed and Mr Evans seconded that a 1/- subscription be established to defray costs. Carried.</p>
<p>Other motions were passed enabling the above to be implemented.</p>

<p>Public Meeting at Kooringa</p>
<p>On Monday a meeting was held to discuss the memorial lately presented to Parliament by Mr Dale on the subject of the repeal of the tax on wood cutting. Mr Arthur Motley was voted into the chair.</p>
<p>The object of the meeting was to dispose of any funds remaining and to hear from Mr Dale MP.</p>
<p>Mr Dale said he had presented the memorial and it had been agreed to have it printed. He gave notice that he intended to take action on it and consulted others on the nest way to proceed. The Commissioner of Crown Lands had asked him to postpone action for a week to allow the Government time to consider the matter. On 30 May he had moved that the memorial be taken into consideration with a view to complying with the request. He had spoken in support. The chairmen then read the Hansard report of his speech. He had then withdrawn the motion when the Government assured him they would be introducing even more liberal measures without delay and the Government had communicated with interested parties who had been satisfied with the Government’s promises.</p>
<p>It was resolved that Mr Bryar [or Briar?] be paid the balance in hand for arranging the meeting.</p>
<p>This concluded the meeting, but Mr Motley was voted into the chair to continue a discussion on the new tariff.</p>
<p>Mr Hervey asked why there were increased taxes on tea and tobacco and not on real property where absentee landlords would be paying. Mr Dale said he preferred the latter taxes, but they could not immediately be introduced as they required a valuation of the whole colony. It was true that some necessities of life had been taxed more heavily, but ad valorem taxes had been abolished and on the whole it was a good result. The duty had been removed from many articles in exchange for an increase on spirits etc. He agreed that sugar was a necessity, but thought the result overall of taxing just 15 goods was an improvement. He went on to praise the Governments actions in abolishing immigration and in retrenchment. It had also placed a liberal sum on the estimates for a bridge across the creek [at Redruth].</p>
<p>One voice suggested they could do without the bridge, but did not like the tax on tobacco.</p>

<p>Copper Mines. [The article begins with references to copper discoveries in the far north of SA.]</p>
<p>While speaking of copper mines we may refer to that of Captain Walter Hughes on Yorke’s Peninsula within about four miles of Port Riley. It has been rather quarried than properly worked. The first shipment was made by the schooner Daphne, which brought 50 tons to Port Adelaide this week, but there are nearly 1,000 tons at grass. It is said three times that amount could be raised in a short time. The ore is supposed to be 26-28% copper and contains sufficient iron to work as a flux with the ore of the Burra Burra Mine. We understand arrangements are likely with the Patent Copper Co. [i.e. the English &amp; Australian Copper Co.] who have sometimes used Karkulto ore for the same purpose. The location of the new mine is most favourable, with ore capable of being carted to the seaboard for 8/- per ton compared with the Burra to Port Adelaide cost of 50/- to £3 per ton.</p>

<p>The Census Returns.</p>
<p>The latest census returns give the population of the colony on 1 April as 117,967. The Government allows an additional 1,033 for omissions and overnight travellers, to make a total of 119,000. Since then it is known that immigration and returning colonists have exceeded outgoing movements, so that the present population is estimated to be about 120,000.</p>

<p>Last week a committee of the Broughton River Mining Company visited the mine. They reported very favourably on its prospects and on the recently discovered lode. Shareholders are encouraged and several experienced miners have urged the full development of its resources. The lode has widened to 12 or 15 ft and experienced men say that with sufficient capital the enterprise would be well rewarded.</p>
<p>The discovery of the new mine on Yorke’s Peninsula has caused no little sensation here and I have heard of several parties who contemplate travelling there.</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson of St Mary’s has preached two sermons in aid of the cemetery funds here. Other ministers are likely to emulate him. It is time some such effort was made, as the walls surrounding the burial ground are yet to be paid for and efforts to interest the public have so far failed.</p>
<p>The weather has continued fine with only a little rain and some frosty mornings. The sunshiny days have seen the continued growth of pasture.</p>

<p>Obituary. Last Sunday a young girl living at Redruth found the body of a man lying in an old level belonging to the Bon Accord Mine. The body was identified as that of an old man named Arthur Quinn; an old colonist well known in the Burra. A vein in an arm had been severed and a knife with blood on it lay nearby. An inquest before Mr MacDermott returned a verdict of felo de se [i.e. suicide]. The deceased was a shoemaker of intemperate habits and it is thought that the failure to arrive of his usual remittance from Ireland and his intemperate habits led to this sad outcome. [Arthur Quinn died 22 July 1860 at Aberdeen, residence Kooringa age estimated at 50.]</p>

<p>I wish to comment on the inconvenience of sending parcels per rail to Gawler. I despatched a parcel from Adelaide Station on 17 July, intending to pass through Kooringa on my way north and call there for my parcel. It is now 25 July, but it has not arrived and until it arrives I am compelled to remain in Kooringa. Who will pay the expenses incurred? Will the Railway Company or the Royal Mail Company?</p>

<p>We are again threatened with another exodus in the form of a somewhat extensive migration to the recently discovered mine on Yorke’s Peninsula. While it may not at present be of so alarming a character as that associated with the Snowy River Rush, it is likely to prove more lasting and inevitable. This has been caused by the arrival here of Captain Hughes, who has engaged a number of miners to proceed to Yorke’s Peninsula to test the richness of that locality. If the undertaking turns out well doubtless many more will follow and there will be a partial desertion of the miners here, unless equal inducements be offered.</p>
<p>The streets here have been busy with the number of drays engaged in carting firewood to the Smelting Works and those conveying stocks of stores to the sheep stations. Roads are in a passable state due to the recent fine weather.</p>

<p>Advertisement. For Sale, the Caroona Mine, located about 30 miles north of the Burra, on a section leased from the Government for 14 years, the full years’ rent of which has been paid up. About £300 has been expended on the property. There is abundant wood on the property and water at one mile. Our operations are principally confined to sinking on three lodes. One shaft is down 10 fathoms on the course of lode, which contains a most promising lode from 11⁄2 to 4 ft wide. The lode is a beautiful gozzan, iron and very rich stones of copper ore of various kinds. There is another lode of a similar nature to the west going down nearly perpendicular. There are several other lodes on which we have done but little. The present proprietors feel quite confident in recommending the property. It has been inspected by several experienced men, who all agree that a moderate amount of money laid out under experienced men would make the mine payable in a short time.</p>

<p>The Karkulto Mine. The persistence of the SA Mining Association Directors in working this mine is likely to be rewarded. Captain Roach in his report of 8 September says a splendid lode has been found in the 25 fathom level going north from the diagonal shaft. Samples of red oxide obtained have shown 30% copper. In a subsequent report the Captain continues to speak favourably. A large sum of money has been spent on the mine; not less than ________. [The sum is unclear, being printed as £30,00 , but the report of the company printed in the Register 18 October 1860, page 2 gives the figure as £31,407 so the above estimate must have been £30,000.] We are glad it may now be reckoned among the prosperous mines in the colony.</p>

<p>Return of Mr Stuart</p>
<p>Mr Stuart has returned from his epic trip to the northern interior, as stated by us yesterday. We received news of this from a correspondent in the north on Wednesday evening and on Thursday the following extract of a letter from Mr Goyder, the Assistant Surveyor-General was read in both Houses of the Legislature:</p>
<p>‘Chamber’s Creek, September 13, 1860,</p>
<p>Mr Stuart left here today for the south. He and his party are ill with scurvy. They have been to lat. 18°47’, long. 134°, when they were compelled to return, the party being unable to cope with natives who attacked them.’</p>
<p>The point reached was about 1,100 miles beyond the settled districts and more than 500 miles beyond the western boundary of the colony. It nearly completes the track across the continent to the point reached by Mr Gregory from the northern side, down the course of the Victoria River. Mr Stuart was not prepared to contend with a strong body of natives, as his party consisted only of himself and two men. Mr Stuart may be expected in Adelaide in a few days.</p>

<p>Kooringa Institute</p>
<p>The AGM of the Kooringa Institute was held on 23 September. Rev. Ibbetson was called to the chair and the secretary read the 3rd annual report. There has been a steady increase in membership and this has been chiefly from the class of persons for whom the Institute was intended. Unfortunately the Government has seen fit to cease the annual grant to the Institute when it was well known that in the faith that such grants would continue a number of people have contributed to the Institute. Expenditure in the last year upon the building has been £78-13-5, for newspapers and periodicals £20 for a total of £98-13-5. Two items are not likely to occur again; £20-3-10 for Mr Smelt’s salary, and the expense of finishing a room for the librarian to live in £15-2-1, amounting to £35-5-11. The income from subscriptions and the Government grant has been £39-11-0. The treasurer Mr Oldham is not at hand to say whether the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. has paid it annual donation of £10 or not. Mr Henry Ayers has advised that he has placed £20 to the credit of the Institute, to be regarded not as an annual gift, but as a donation. Income from members’ tickets and Mr Smelt’s tuition in the 1st quarter was £9-2-6, in the second quarter £11-14-6 from members’ tickets, for the third quarter £12-17-6 and for the present quarter £14. Total income has been therefore £87-5-6 without the English &amp; Australian Copper Co.’s £10. Lighting cost £16-2-2 and firewood £17-10-0 (totalling £33-12-2).</p>
<p>There are 747 books in the library and 1,546 have attended the reading room from 1 January to 31 August.</p>

<p>The past week has been very wet. It started with a sharp shower on Saturday night, but on Sunday it fell in torrents accompanied by fearful lightning and thunder. The creeks and streets were deluged. Commercial Street and others became navigable rivers. Subsequently the creek rose, broke its banks and swept all before it. Fortunately it did not rise as far as anticipated and the main damage was to some ore washing machines near the Mine. Although the streets were left in a deplorable state, the warm dry weather since has allowed them to dry considerably.</p>
<p>The little chapel, Paxton Square, belonging to the Congregationalists and latterly used for divine service by the Welsh Church has been thoroughly repaired and renovated and on Sunday was re-opened by the United Presbyterians; Rev. W. Davidson of that body intending to settle here. Services were conducted in the morning by the Rev. Davidson, in the afternoon by Rev. Whittaker and in the evening by Rev. Lloyd. It was exactly ten years since the chapel first opened for public worship.</p>

<p>The German Lutheran Church at Redruth has been in the course of erection for some years and at length is drawing towards completion. The site where it stands was presented by Mr Graham and nine years ago the foundation stone was laid by the Freemasons. Before long, however, when the walls were about four feet high, progress was halted by the discovery of gold in Victoria. The building stayed in this state until building was resumed last year. The walls, roof, floors and windows are now completed and it just required flooring, plastering and ceiling to make it usable. It is about 60 ft x 30 ft with 18 ft walls. It has no architectural pretensions and is built of plain rubble. The door is between two windows in the middle of one side, three windows at the rear and one at each end. Great credit is due to the small number of subscribers who have persevered (about 80). They still require some £300 to complete the work and it will be long ere they will be able to raise that if left to their own unaided efforts.</p>
<p>There has not been much talk of late of the Wallaroo Mines, the general view being that there is enough labour there at present.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association [Editorial]</p>
<p>The half-yearly report of the Directors was forwarded to shareholders a few days ago and the half-yearly meeting was held last Wednesday. The operations of the Association have, it appears, been more successful during the past 6 months than those of the two preceding years. The quantity of ore raised amounted to 6,940 tons. A portion of this was obtained from dressing refuse ores from former periods. A t the close of the half-year ending 31 March there was on hand at the Mine 4396 tons of ore. This, added to yield of the last six months brings the quantity to 11,336 tons. Of this 5,807 tons have been delivered to the Copper Co. for smelting and 5,528 tons remain at the Mine. About 600 tons of copper have been sold in Adelaide since the last report, at an average of £101-13-10 per ton, but the declining price of copper in London has meant the Directors have had to reduce the price here to £95 per ton. There are about 70 tons of copper presently on hand. To the end of September 1859 the cost of producing 6,979 tons of ore was £81,134-17-4. This ore realised £93,239-4-8, leaving a nett profit of £12,104-XX-X. The cost of raising the ore referred to was £11-12-6 per ton and the nett proceeds were £13-7-2 per ton; making the profit £1-14-8 per ton. This is not as favourable a result as previously.</p>
<p>For the last half-year and for the previous half-year the amounts realised per ton have been considerably lower than for previous sales. The Directors do not indicate whether this is due to a lower quality of ore or to a fall in the price of copper. It is probably the former, resulting from the admixture of ores recently raised with ores from a previous period. The Directors do not expect the results of the next report to be as good as the present, though they do say the half year just finished shows an improvement. In estimating profits the Directors have to deal with three half-year periods; namely the half-year profits that have been attained by actual returns, and the two succeeding half-year profits, which can only be approximately estimated. For the first of these periods to 30 September 1859, the profits ascertained are £12,104-7-4, for the second, to 31 March 1860, the profits are estimated to be £11,000 and for the period to 29 September 1860 the profits estimated are £13,231-7-1. The absolute balance in the hands of Directors is £24,444-12-5. Out of this they intend to pay a dividend of £5 per share [100%] before the end of next March. In addition to the balance on hand, the value of ore and copper not yet realised is estimated at £24,231-7-1, making the total profit balance £48,675-19-6.</p>
<p>The Captain’s reports of the Mine continue to be very favourable both with respect to the present ground and future prospects. The expenditure in connection with the Karkulto Mine appears to have been £31,407. Captain Roach’s account of this mine is also favourable and the Directors hope to make it produce a profit in the future to counter the heavy expenses already incurred. The Directors have one of their captains in the far north examining and reporting on the mineral nature of the country there. We do not infer from their report that they entertain great hopes of important mineral discoveries. With respect to three of the four mining claims near Mt McKinlay that Captain Bryant was sent to test, he has recommended abandoning three of them.</p>
<p>The number of persons employed by the company is 953, being a reduction of 125. Doubtless this is due to the large demand for miners in other parts of the colony rather than a decline in the demand at the Burra Burra Mine.</p>

<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel celebrated its Anniversary Services on Sunday when sermons were preached by Rev. T. Lloyd and Rev. W. Davidson. Both Monday’s tea meeting and the following public meeting were numerously attended. Mr MacDermott SM was one of the speakers and he said that he believed the chapel was in debt. This did not greatly worry him when the debt was incurred by the necessity of enlarging their place of worship. The debt was £1,000 and Rev. Whittaker appealed for funds to reduce that amount. Mr Wilkinson reminded them that it was not so long ago that there were no such buildings as that in which they were assembled and the preachers proclaimed the gospel under stately gum trees. The colony was very young, but there was not a country in the world possessing as many places of worship in proportion to the population; a point with which Rev. Davidson agreed. He said chapels here were actually built in anticipation of congregations. Recently he had opened one at a place where there were only 60 inhabitants; and what was more, the chapel was not in debt. He did not agree that the debt did not require attention. The future generations would have quite enough of their own problems to contend with and he urged them to spare no time in removing the £1,000 debt. Rev. T. Lloyd also spoke at considerable length on the debt; of how it had been incurred and their prospects of paying it. He appealed for the assistance of the public in this matter.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held by Dr Ward JP on the body of John Clark last night. Yesterday Clark, in the company of his friend and, I believe, partner, was engaged in cutting timber for the Burra Mine. His wife was also present. They were cutting a live tree from which some time ago a branch had fallen. This branch was still attached to the tree, with the other end embedded in the ground and offering some support to the tree. The tree fell as intended, but in doing so the dead branch turned around with great force and jammed Clark against the stump, killing him instantly, thrusting his head and chest against the stump. He died instantly and his body presented a frightful appearance. The skull was entirely laid open, the whole brain knocked out, an ear cut off and teeth knocked out. The chest was also crushed and the body bruised all over. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The deceased leaves a wife and three children.</p>

<p>Royal Mining Co. held its half-yearly general meeting last Wednesday morning, 8 November at the Gresham Hotel in King William Street. Mr H. Mildred MP took the chair. Mr Tomkinson asked what had reduced the assets from £300 to £90 in the last six months and was told it was due to £37 to the secretary’s salary, £78 for Directors’ fees and the rest was advertising, stationery and travelling expenses. He said operations at Karkulto had not gone well and the lease with the man in charge had terminated. 272 tons of iron ore at grass had not been sold. The Directors still thought there were remunerative quantities of copper there, but they would leave any decision to the shareholders. Mr Wilkinson moved that the Directors take the necessary steps to wind up the company. He said the only persons getting a regular return from the company were the Directors and the £94 in hand would not keep the company going for another six months. No progress seems to have been made since 1857. [Further discussion is then reported.] Eventually the motion was put and carried 15 to 8.</p>

<p>A local sensation occurred in the past week when a local man named Davey eloped with another man’s wife. He deserted his own wife and children and neglected to pay his creditors. This caused a telegram to be sent to Kapunda where he was detained. On his return to Kooringa he was greeted by a large crowd and escorted to the Police station amid the scorn and derision of the multitude. After a trial in the local court he was discharged on legal and technical grounds. His disgrace and punishment continued. Yesterday evening his paramour, who incidentally is a grandmother, returned and provoked another display of popular indignation. The crowd accompanied her to her residence and to a late hour provided every species of insult, annoyance and abuse.</p>

<p>Was driving a wagon loaded with coal last Wednesday at 5 or 6 o’clock near the Mule Camp at Logan’s Gap. The deceased and another boy were riding on the load. About a mile from the camp the boy Cock took up the keg for a drink and then got off behind. When putting the keg right, I heard a screech and looking back saw the deceased getting up from the ground. Stopped the wagon immediately, but did not know the wheel had passed over him. Saw that his hands were wounded, but did not think him seriously hurt, as he got up without assistance and walked away with the other boy, getting through the fence into the paddock. Cannot say whether deceased was getting down or fell from the front of the wagon.</p>
<p>Isaac Cock aged about 14 confirmed the above and added that the deceased was getting down from the front of the wagon when he slipped and fell. Was unaware of the seriousness of the injury except to his hands. Went with deceased through the paddock to within about half a mile of where his mother lives and then went to tend cattle. The wheel went across the stomach of the deceased, but he did not then complain of any pain.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Williams said that about 4 a.m. on Thursday morning she and other women were crossing the paddock to Mrs Rankine’s when they found James Rankine lying apparently dead. His mother came soon afterwards and they had asked him where it hurt and he had said his belly. He at first denied the wheel had gone over him because his mother had forbidden him to go on the road, but afterwards said Sherwood had asked him to help with the horses and he had fallen from the wagon and the wheel passed over him. Got some men to carry him home, where he died at 2 or 3 p.m. His mother had heard of the accident and they had been searching for him all the evening. The night had been very cold and dark.</p>
<p>[Mrs Rankine’s evidence essentially confirmed the above. She added deceased had left home after dinner on Wednesday and she did not know where he was going, but someone had told her the Mule Camp. A small girl had told her of the accident.]</p>
<p>Dr T.H. Mayne said the wheel would have caused rupture of the intestines and this would inevitably have proved fatal. The actions described by the others were quite consistent with this. Deceased may well have not been in immediate pain, but inflammation would have soon set in with ultimately fatal consequences.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of accidental death with no blame attached to the driver of the wagon.</p>
<p>[This death does not appear in SA Death Registrations CD.]</p>
<p>‘A Shepherd’ writes concerning the news he recently received, apparently rather delayed due to his remoteness, of the tax on shepherds’ dogs. This he believes is set at 10/- p.a. for each dog over six months of age, but with additional fees will effectively be 14/-. This is an outrageous imposition on shepherds for whom a dog or dogs are as much an essential tool of trade as is a needle for a tailor. He estimates that there must be 10,000 sheep and cattle dogs in the colony. He asks the editor to confirm the truth of the rumour about this tax. If true it is a very serious imposition on ‘a shepherd, with family of five, and rations for two, with £40 per year.’</p>

<p>On Thursday and Friday last the scholars of Mr Miller of St Mary’s School were examined by Rev. Ibbetson in the presence of a number of parents and friends. The program included scripture, history, grammar, natural philosophy, arithmetic, reading, etc. Prizes were distributed to the most proficient on Friday and tea and cakes were provided.</p>
<p>At Redruth the school run by Mr Bennett has been going for about 10 months. There are 87 pupils; 52 boys and 35 girls. The smaller students being in a separate room with Mrs Bennetts. The scholars here were somewhat severely tested in mental arithmetic, geography, grammar, spelling, reading and history, but they proved themselves equal to the ordeal, with prompt answers and general intelligence. Mr MacDermott, in retiring, expressed his pleasure and complimented the teacher and scholars on the efficiency of the school. There was a vigorous onslaught on the tea and cake before the school broke up for the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>On Friday Mr &amp; Mrs Stephens held their examinations. The infant school is conducted by Mrs Stephens, assisted by an intelligent monitor. Here there are 40 boys and 26 girls. The pupils displayed quietness and decorum and a proficiency that is testimony to the superiority of the Lancastrian over the old-dame-school system in the management and instruction of the young. In the evening the upper school was examined by Messrs R.G. Wilkinson, Forder and Stephens and Rev. Davidson in geography, reading, spelling, history, mental arithmetic, etc. The whole result was most creditable to both teacher and students. Four of the most advanced pupils assist Mr Stephens as monitors and they were examined separately. They competed for a prize, but were so evenly matched that it was only with difficulty that the decision was finally in favour of a boy named Williams. After this Mr Stephens entertained the students with a series of dissolving views. He also revealed that unknown to him, a group of gentlemen who took an interest in the school, had sent a parcel of books to be distributed as prizes. The Magistrate Mr McDermott is to be commended for his interest shown in visiting all the examinations of schools in the district, even at some inconvenience to himself.</p>
<p>A public temperance meeting was held on Wednesday in the Primitive Methodist Chapel. For various reasons the attendance was small. Mr J. Skews Sen. took the chair and addresses were given by Revs Davidson and Whittaker. Several people signed the pledge after the meeting.</p>

<p>Burleeyung Cave near Kooringa</p>
<p>This is located about 16 miles south of Kooringa between Mr McDonald’s Cave and the Adelaide Road. The entrance is on top of a hill and, being insignificant in appearance, might easily be passed by unnoticed. The mouth is a hole about 5 ft long and 21⁄2 ft wide and some 20 feet deep. On descending we found ourselves in a tolerable chamber extending about 20 ft to the northwest, the sides and top being of jagged stone and the floor strewn with loose rocks. At the end of the chamber was a steep slope to the westward. The roof sloped similarly and was very low, obliging us to lie close to the rock and edge our way some 10 or 12 ft. We then encountered a passage running north some 20 yards. In some places we could stand, but in others we had to crawl; an unpleasant experience given the jagged rocks above and below. This led to a small chamber, which allowed us to stretch out rather more. Here the top and sides were covered in beautiful white stalactites. We procured some beautiful examples and proceeded to look into various other chambers via small apertures. As we proceeded the chambers seemed more beautiful, but the progress grew increasingly difficult and eventually we found the apertures too small to allow further progress. In all our explorations took an hour and we were glad then to breathe the purer atmosphere and regain the light of heaven. Every part we visited was perfectly dry; there was no trace of water anywhere.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon Mr McDermott held an inquest at the Pig &amp; Whistle into the death of a young man named Joseph Rowe who had died the previous day as the result of an accident sustained last week at the racecourse.</p>
<p>Dr T.H. Mayne:</p>
<p>Was called to see the deceased on 1 January at the racecourse. He was suffering from a severe concussion of the brain. Believed then it could proved fatal and attended him up to his death yesterday. The concussion was caused from a fall from a horse. Deceased was not sober at the time. The external signs of injury were slight, but the concussion was the immediate cause of death. Deceased had not regained consciousness since the accident.</p>
<p>John Edwards:</p>
<p>Had been drinking with friends at the Racecourse Inn [Lostwithiel] and was returning across the course when the deceased and some friends on horses intersected their path. The two groups narrowly avoided a collision and when I looked back deceased and his horse were lying on the ground together. The horse was on top of the man. Stopped to render assistance. Thought the man was drunk and unable to control his horse. Had earlier seen him nearly run over a woman and child. When the doctor came the body was removed in a cart and had not seen it since.</p>
<p>William Killicoat:</p>
<p>Had been with deceased until 10 minutes before the accident. At the time of the accident was near the winning post and seeing the crowd, went and found the deceased lying on the ground with the horse on top of him. There was no one then within 50 yards. Got the horse off deceased and Mr Edwards arrived and assisted. They got deceased into a sitting position, but he was quite insensible. The doctor soon arrived and deceased was taken away in a cart. Deceased was not drunk, having had only a glass or two of ale.</p>
<p>Edwards was recalled and satisfactorily explained discrepancies in the evidence. He had tried to move the horse before Killicoat’s arrival.</p>
<p>William Teague, who had been with Edwards, gave corroborative evidence.</p>
<p>Edwards explained that Rowe’s own party did not immediately know he had fallen as he was riding last in their group.</p>
<p>The coroner was satisfied that there seemed no doubt as to the cause of death and the jury returned a verdict ‘That the deceased died from the effects of a fall from a horse, producing concussion of the brain, on the racecourse.’</p>

<p>‘Resident’ writes to the editor from Kooringa 11 January re the proposal to relocate the post office at Kooringa:</p>
<p>It is desirable to amalgamate the office of Postmaster with the Telegraph Office. The rent and a portion of the Postmaster’s salary would be saved. The Telegraph Office is centrally located for the surrounding townships and is convenient for miners, the majority of whom pass it going to and from work.</p>
<p>‘Pro Bono Publico’ writes to the editor also on the Kooringa Post Office question:</p>
<p>It is rumoured that there is a proposal to move the Post Office to a kind of ‘hole-in-the-wall’ position, totally unfit for such a purpose and most in a most inconvenient part of town for public benefit. It would also be beneficial to amalgamate the telegraph and postmastership. This office is far better situated for public convenience and sited to allow the majority of inhabitants to see the arrival of the mail and so know when it is time to apply for our letters.</p>

<p>The solar eclipse on Friday was of general interest. I first noticed the contact at 11 hours 16 minutes, from which time the thermometer fell rapidly. The sky at that time was perfectly clear, but at about the time of greatest obscuration clouds came in and covered the sun so that the moon’s exit from the solar disc could not be observed. The temperature in the sun was 115°F at 11 a.m. At 11.16 it was 104°F. By noon it had fallen to 90°F and at 1.40 p.m. was only 80°F. Clouds thickened from 2 p.m. and a few drops of rain fell. The evening was much cooler.</p>
<p>Prayer meetings have continued throughout the week, with united meetings for devotional exercises daily at the Primitive Methodist Church. There was a special gathering at St Mary’s on Friday evening.</p>
<p>Herr Kohler, the musical celebrity, has been performing here at the Burra Hotel on Monday and Tuesday evenings. There was a good attendance on Monday, but a smaller one on Tuesday. Kohler gave performances on the cornopean, flageolet, concertina, tin whistle and bush piano. [The first two named are a cornet and a type of recorder respectively.]</p>

<p>‘Veritas’ writes to the editor from Kooringa 18 January re Kooringa Post Office in response to two letter on the same subject appearing in the paper of the previous Wednesday:</p>
<p>The telegraph office is not central; rather the reverse, being on the outskirts of the township. It is the last house at the end of town opposite from where the mail cart enters. It is also perched on a hill so high and inaccessible as to prevent the near approach of the mail cart.</p>
<p>On the other hand the proposed so-called ‘hole-in-the-wall’ location in Commercial Street is central and accessible to both miners and tradesmen, of whom the latter group receive fifty times the mail of the former. It is also near the site of the old post office, whose site provoked no adverse comment.</p>
<p>The argument that the new site is more central for Redruth is negated by the fact that Redruth has its own post office. I have been informed by a tradesman that our postmaster has already concluded a contract for enlarging and fitting up the new office in every way worthy of the central position it is to occupy in our principal business street.</p>
<p>‘Uninterested’ also writes to the editor on the same topic. He makes five points in response to the previously published correspondence.</p>
<p>The post office at present is far from central.</p>
<p>Only one building is in its neighbourhood and that is in ruins.</p>
<p>The proposed location in Commercial Street is only 10 yards from the old post office site, which was then considered central and remains so.</p>
<p>With a population of 4,000 the post office must engross the whole attention of the postmaster, without interruption with other matters.</p>
<p>Redruth has its own post office.</p>
<p>25 January 1861, page 3</p>
<p>‘Colonist’ writes to the editor to say that the merging of the positions of telegraph master and postmaster deserves consideration. Also it would benefit country settlers if, as a service to the community, the daily shipping news and other public announcements could be transmitted each morning to each telegraph station.</p>
<p>The writer also urges the utmost care in the selection and training of telegraph officers, who must be made to understand that secrecy is indispensable to their tenure of office.</p>

<p>The removal of the Post Office, which has occasioned such newspaper controversy, seems to be of slight importance to most people.

I believe it will rest with the Government as to wether it is to be amalgamated with the telegraph office or not.</p>

<p>‘Accountant’ writes to the editor re the Burra Burra Mines:</p>
<p>The writer who recently put the profits of the SA Mining Association at a very low figure in order to depreciate the value of the mines at Wallaroo must either intend to mislead or be wilfully ignorant. The published accounts of the Burra Burra Mines show there have been 44 dividends:</p>
<p>9 of 200% £221,760</p>
<p>33 of 100% £406,560</p>
<p>2 of 50% £12,320</p>
<p>Total £640,640</p>
<p>To which must be added profit applied to stock to bring the total declared profit to £788,480. The company also owns 16,607 acres of land and if this is taken into account the total nett profit of the company cannot fall far short of £1 million, if indeed it does not exceed that amount.</p>

<p>Redruth Bridge. Mr Macaulay said that when he estimated the cost of the bridge there was a rush to the Snowy River diggings, but this had not affected the labour market as much as anticipated and consequently he had got the contracts taken at a considerable saving.

<p>This seems strange when so much has been made recently about the importance of keeping up the strength of the volunteer force. It has been explained that the cost of sending up instructors would be too great and volunteers here would be unable to attend battalion drill.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 20 February</p>
<p>I understand the Government has settled the question of the location of the Post Office by deciding to amalgamate it with the Telegraph Office. While this decision is to be commended for its economy, it is unfortunate that it will mean the dismissal of our postmaster with the attendant loss of salary and also with losses he has incurred in setting up a new office on the understanding that he would be continuing in his appointment.</p>
<p>The discovery of the new lode at the Burra Mine is likely to prove a welcome boon to the proprietors, besides which it may well lead to further discoveries in a direction hitherto unexplored. It is to be hope that it will have the effect of reviving the state of things here, for all tradesmen complain loudly of the stagnation of trade.</p>

<p>There has of late been a great mortality among the infants in the district lately from some cause or other. There have been many deaths and illness has afflicted many of the adult population as well. While the changeableness of the weather is considered a factor, the poor sanitation of the town, a matter the inhabitants neglect lamentably, is undoubtedly a major cause.</p>
<p>[Note: the following information from the SA Deaths CD lists deaths in the Burra District for the first two months of 1861 and bears out the above statement:</p>
<p>While this figure of 25 infant deaths in two months is an appalling statistic, it should be noted that for the equivalent period in 1860 the figure was 20 and in 1862 was 21.]</p>
<p>A memorial is being prepared asking the Government to reconsider its decision to amalgamate the post and telegraph offices and asking to continue the employment of the present postmaster on his removal to his new premises.

<p>Fire</p>
<p>An inquest was held on Saturday at the Pig &amp; Whistle before Mr MacDermott SM into a fire that had broken out that morning on the premises of J.N. Bennett, consisting of a large shop, three dwelling houses and four cottages. It was thought the fire originated in an old hay shed in the occupation of Mr T. Bath. The fire spread very rapidly and in a short time the shop and attached houses, which were all built of wood, were utterly consumed, as were the roofs of two or three of the cottages. Had it not been for timely assistance the fire might have spread much further and done considerably more damage.</p>
<p>The jury of respectable men was headed by Mr John Winnall.</p>
<p>William Lewis:</p>
<p>Was shaving when someone said there was a fire in the shed where Mr Bath kept hay. First saw the fire in the southwest corner of the shed. Mrs Richards gave him a bucket of water which he threw on the fire. Mr Bath and others came and all worked hard to extinguish the blaze. Some adjoining houses were partially unroofed to prevent the fire from spreading. It took about 21⁄2 hours to put the fire out. The fire originated in a paling place containing hay and some salt. Did not know the origin of the fire. The shed was about 8 or 10 ft from the bakehouse at the back.</p>
<p>Albert Gibbs:</p>
<p>Saw the fire at about 8 a.m. First thought it was a chimney on fire, but then saw flames coming through the palings. Thought then it could have been put out with a few buckets of water, but not thinking clearly, he ran to give the alarm to the neighbours, telling them to get their money and children out. Mr Bath came soon after. The fire was in the front of the building opposite the schoolroom. Besides the wooden buildings there were two houses burnt and one destroyed. He had heard nothing as to the origin of the fire and had no opinion himself.</p>
<p>Charles Oldenschlagel:</p>
<p>Was at work in his shop when he heard the alarm raised. He rushed out and saw Mr Lewis with buckets of water, trying to extinguish the fire. Thought the fire must have started in the shed at the bottom, at the back right hand corner. He had not heard complaints regarding ashes being thrown out, but believed Mrs Langenberger had made complaints. Threw two or three buckets of water on the fire but smoke prevented his entering the shed. Was about to pull down some palings when Dr Mayne forbade him. Had never noticed sparks coming fro m the bakery chimney.</p>
<p>Bertha Langenberger:</p>
<p>Was in my kitchen baking some cakes when I saw the fire and took my pails of water to Mr Moore who threw them on the fire. Mrs Moore did the same. She had never complained of ashes being thrown there.</p>
<p>Thomas Bath:</p>
<p>At 8.30 came to his office and was soon afterwards informed of the fire. Called for water and fetched some wet blankets. When he returned the fire had already spread from the shed. Though it likely the fire originated from ashes thrown out. Neighbours generally threw ashes out near his shed. There was a heap right against the palings. The young man in his employ whose business was to go there did not smoke. He rented the shed from Mr Bennett and his loss would be inconsiderable. All the cottages, some of which were partially destroyed, had back doors and may have thrown ashes near the shed. Had no doubt the fire originated at the back of the building near the ash heap.</p>
<p>The jury concluded that the fire had started accidentally in the ash heap against the building and attached blame to the practice of throwing out ashes without taking sufficient care to extinguish the fire they may contain.</p>

<p>St Mary’s is about to lose Rev. D.H.J. Ibbetson. I believe he is appointed to St John’s Adelaide and will leave here next week. Rev. Mr Fulford is mentioned as his replacement.</p>
<p>The forthcoming election has not so far aroused any interest here.</p>
<p>There is great dissatisfaction with the mail service between here and Kapunda. The accommodation of passengers could be much improved and should be attended to if the contractor wishes to retain his monopoly.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the recent fire will be a salutary lesson to the town. Precautions against such events have habitually been disregarded here, with highly flammable items stored in unsuitable places and fires carelessly suffered to exist so that it is a wonder the whole town has not been consumed long ago.</p>
<p>12 March 1861, page 3</p>
<p>Fire</p>
<p>On Saturday at about 4 a.m. Messrs Warren Bros. Store at Redruth was found to be alight. A servant who slept with a child in a room next to the shop heard a noise in the store and saw that the corner of her room was alight. She snatched up the child and raised the alarm. Mr Warren and Mr Forder and others had also been aroused by the explosion and soon found the store full of flames and smoke. It was already too late to save the store and efforts were directed to saving the neighbouring tenements, among which Mr Forder’s was in imminent danger. Fortunately they were successful, though the store was utterly consumed.</p>
<p>A coroner’s inquest was held in the afternoon at the Court House before J.H. Howell JP.</p>
<p>Ann Hall:</p>
<p>About 3.55 a.m. was asleep in a room at the back of Warren’s store when awoken by a noise and saw flames bursting through the roof. Snatched up the child and fled the room, crying ‘Fire’. Mr Warren tried to save some contents of the store. Did not go round to the front of the store, but re-entered my room to save a bundle of clothing and then a box of clothes of Mr Warren’s daughter. Did not again return. The store had been closed since before 7 p.m. the previous night. Did not know how the fire had started. Never went into the store after it was closed. Was certain she had extinguished her candle last night and had not been reading in bed that night.</p>
<p>Pearce Rogers Warren:</p>
<p>Was awakened by a tremendous crash in the shop, at the back of which he slept in a detached cottage. Immediately entered the shop by the back door in an attempt to save the books, but the store was a sheet of flame and he was knocked down by the violence of the flame and smoke. He had to crawl on his hands and knees and saved neither the books nor any of the stock. The stock in trade was drapery and groceries. Kept only a few matches and they were in a tin box made for the purpose. He had gone to the box the night before and the matches were then safe. There was nothing in the store that might ignite spontaneously. The door had been well fastened. Stock had been insured for £1,000, but their books showed the value to be about £1,500. The premises were rented with right of purchase and were not insured. They had only insured lately on account of the danger from the blacksmith’s fires. Had no idea of the possible cause. In answer to a question from the jury he said there had been a threat held out to him, but he had not attached much importance to it. There were debts on the books amounting to about £800, but they had no means of recovering them except from memory.</p>
<p>Police Trooper Hunter lived at the police barracks opposite the scene of the fire, he was present, but could not assist, having a broken arm. The rest of his evidence is corroborative.</p>

<p>Yesterday the anniversary of the Burra Burra Lodge MUIOOF was celebrated with a dinner at the Burra Hotel. A company of about 80 sat down to an excellent repast at about 6 p.m. Mr MacDermott SM occupied the chair, with P.G. Corey in the Vice-Chair. Toasts are reported involving, Mr Beale, P.G. Dawson, P.G. Pearce, V.G. Snell, P.S. Dennis, Mr Ledan, N.G. Sampson, Bro. James Pearce, Bro. Baker, P.G. Kent, Bro Drake &amp; Mr Lee. The Burra Burra Lodge had 275 members on the books.</p>

<p>The mail remains unsatisfactory. On Monday it broke down on the road about 25 miles from Kooringa and the mail had to be brought in on horseback. Today the mail-driver was fined for working horses with sore shoulders.</p>
<p>Today a young boy employed at the mine was sentenced to seven days solitary confinement for throwing a stone at an old German who was a fellow employee, occasioning severe injury.</p>
<p>The recent fires have hopefully taught people here to exercise greater care in the storage of combustibles.</p>
<p>An enterprising tradesman here has lately started a cab in the neighbourhood. While it is a great convenience, it remains to be seen if it will be profitable.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest was held on Wednesday afternoon on the suicide of a German named Christopher Bollmann at Hampton. He had been greatly distressed by the illness and death if a child and took strychnine on the previous day, dying in great agony after lingering for the whole of the afternoon.</p>
<p>F.B. Howell JP conducted the inquest.</p>
<p>Thomas Watkins:</p>
<p>Came home last night about 6.30 and my wife told me Bollmann’s child was dying. Went in and found Bollmann himself in convulsions. Bollmann said he was glad to see him as he was very ill and had no one to give him water. Gave him water and then returned home to eat. Later returned to Bollmann who then told him he had taken strychnine that he had got from Mr Parker, chemist, for his dog. Mrs Bollmann did not believe her husband had taken poison as she believed all the poison in the house was locked in her workbox. Stayed with Bollmann, who died about 7.30 p.m. Mrs Bollmann, being recently confined, was unable to nurse her husband. Medical assistance had been sent for before witness had come home. Believed deceased had taken the poison at about 2.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Watkins:</p>
<p>Was in Bollmann’s house yesterday when the child died about 2.30 p.m. Deceased had then taken a nobbler of brandy. Deceased then went into the next house, and lying on the ground, went into hysterics. Gave him a drink of water and deceased then said he had taken poison. Asked Mrs Bollmann if they had any poison. She had said they had arsenic, but it was locked in her workbox and she did not believe her husband had taken poison. Sent for the doctor as she feared it was something serious. Did not send for the police, as there was no one to send.</p>
<p>Robert Bevan:</p>
<p>Last night at about 7.30 went to see deceased after Mrs Watkins said he was dying. Found him lying on the floor on his face and took his hand and turned him onto his back. He neither moved nor spoke afterwards. Mrs Bollmann came in and shook him, but believe he was then dead.</p>
<p>Henry Snooks:</p>
<p>Had known deceased two or three years. He was a very quiet and steady man and worked with him on Marchant’s Station. About three weeks ago he left and had since been driving a mule team. He was not destitute. Deceased had said if the child died he would leave his wife. Went to see him between 2 &amp; 3 o’clock and found him lying as though he had fainted. Got him onto the bed. He told the witness he had taken arsenic. Witness then went next door and told them to send for a doctor, as Bollmann had taken poison. Had to leave then, as he was very poorly himself.</p>
<p>Joseph Parker, chemist:</p>
<p>Deceased had come in with another and asked for poison to destroy his dog, which he said was howling and disturbing the child. Gave him 10 grains. Deceased was sober and he and his companion were talking about the dog all the time they were in the shop. Also made up medicine for the child.</p>
<p>James Symonds gave evidence of seeing deceased at about 2 p.m. the day before. Deceased had gone to Nankervis’s for some wine and witness had gone on to work at the Mine.</p>
<p>Dr L.J. Maurau:</p>
<p>Got home at about 6 p.m. from visiting patients. Was told a little girl had been for him to see Mr Bollmann who was very ill. Nothing was said about poison. Had a number of patients waiting and saw them as quickly as possible. Was hurrying with his dinner when a boy came to say a man was dying at Mrs Watkins’ at Hampton. Went immediately, but found the deceased had been dead about half an hour. Knew deceased. Was satisfied from what he had seen and been told that the deceased had died from strychnine. Had visited the dying child about 1 p.m. Deceased was then much troubled about the child. He did not think he could possibly have saved the deceased even had he been home when sent for.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of suicide and expressed their opinion that the neighbours had been grossly negligent in not taking more energetic actions to get medical help. They also thought the Government should take actions to restrict the sale of poisons.</p>
<p>[Charles Bollman died 19 March 1861 at Hampton aged 1.</p>
<p>Christopher Bollman died 19 March 1861 at Hampton aged 35.</p>
<p>The newly born baby was Christopher Bollman born 14 March 1861, Hampton.</p>
<p>Mrs Emma Bollman married Walter Way 21 July 1861 and had 8 children with him. He died at Wallaroo in 1901, but she survived until 6 February 1931 at Wallaroo, when she died aged 96.]</p>

<p>A bazaar in aid of the new Anglican Church at Redruth was opened yesterday in St Mary’s Church. The weather had been most unpropitious and the late arrival of some of the ‘needful’ items put organisers to greater inconvenience. There were five stalls plus a plentifully furnished supply of eatables. The influx of visitors during the day was rather limited, but in the evening the room was considerably crowded.</p>
<p>The return cricket match between Burra Burra and Hamilton is expected to take place here on Easter Monday.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 27 March</p>
<p>The bazaar in aid of the proposed Redruth Anglican Church continued on Wednesday &amp; Thursday. The people continued to patronise it and be the end of Thursday the proceeds were upwards of £200. It was then decoded to continue the sale on the following Monday &amp; Tuesday. As a result Sunday’s service was transferred to the Redruth Court House. Remaining stock was auctioned on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>A group of serenaders gave performances at the Burra Hotel on Friday &amp; Saturday, but in these dull times few people evidently felt like parting with their money. The group performed at Aberdeen last night.</p>
<p>There has been no interest here in the general election.</p>
<p>Wallaroo continues to attract numbers of miners. Several families have left here in the past week and if its promise continues more can be expected to follow.</p>

<p>This has been a week of enjoyments; picnics, excursion parties, tea parties, shooting parties and cricket. The weather has been very good.</p>
<p>On Sunday the Anniversary of the Wesleyan Sunday School was celebrated with special services. The guest preacher was Rev. Spencer Williams of Norwood. On Monday the teachers and students went in procession through the town and then gathered for tea and cakes. The tea meeting that followed was very successful and the whole affair was the most interesting and successful Anniversary held in Kooringa. The public meeting in the chapel was crowded. Mr J. Paul chaired the meeting and the secretary J. Skews reported that there were 257 scholars and 50 teachers on the books and the school was flourishing. On Monday morning Rev. Williams preached a sermon in Welsh for the benefit of the Welsh community here.</p>
<p>The election last Thursday was so quiet an affair that many here did not know of it until it was all over. Only 72 exercised the franchise at the polling station at Kooringa, and coming one by one, they passed unobserved. No one seemed to take the slightest interest in the matter. Had the election been more local in character more interest might have been taken. We may soon see if that is the case, as the involuntary resignation of Mr Lennon has created a vacancy in the representation of this district. Already a requisition has called for Mr G.S. Kingston to stand and if Mr J.B. Neales is unsuccessful in the Upper House he is likely to be asked to stand in the Lower House for this district.</p>
<p>The return cricket match between Burra Burra &amp; Hamilton came off on Easter Monday and drew a good crowd. In the end Burra men were victorious by 144 runs:</p>
<p>Burra Burra 96 &amp; 130 defeated Hamilton 47 &amp; 35.</p>
<p>Rev. Ibbetson preached his farewell sermon last Sunday at St Mary’s. At the formal farewell the following Monday he was presented with a purse of 50 sovereigns and the pupils of the Sunday school gave him a silver pencil case.</p>

<p>Election Notice</p>
<p>J. Bentham Neales announces his intention of running for the House of Assembly to represent the Burra and Clare District. He outlines his views on several subjects:</p>
<p>Supports the Real Property Act, while wishing to improve certain working details.</p>
<p>Will not vote for grants to education that excludes the Bible from the instruction. The outer districts must be supported in education, ‘carefully avoiding the introduction of proselytism where the scholars are necessarily of different denominations’.</p>
<p>Will support the leasing of Crown Lands for mineral purposes. Will support claims for changes based on the good old West of England experiences.</p>
<p>On emigration: SA with only 120,000 people needs more population. The last scheme has run its course, but Parliament no doubt has the wit to find means of stimulating migration.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association [Editorial]</p>
<p>The AGM of the Association was held in the company’s office on 17 April. The report of the Directors was submitted and adopted. The retiring Directors: Messrs Arthur Blyth, John Beck, Thomas Graves, John Charles Boord and John Hector, were all re-elected. A vote of thanks was passed to Captain Roach.</p>
<p>Despite the loss of miners to the new Wallaroo Mines, activity at the Burra Burra Mine has been pursued with undiminished vigour. The ore raised in the last half-year has been described as equal in quantity and quality to ‘the production of similar periods’. 6,406 tons were raised compared with 6,940 tons in the previous six months. The total number of hands employed has decreased by 65 in the half-year; there now being 888. In the last six months 1,231 tons of fine copper have been received from the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. More than 860 tons of copper have been sold in Adelaide for an average price of £95-11-3 per ton. 170 tons has been sent to London for sale. At the start of this month the ore on hand was 3,843 tons and the copper on hand was 266 tons.</p>
<p>The cost of producing 7,243 tons of ore raised from September 1859 to March 1860 was £78,135-14-5 or £10-15-9 per ton. The nett profit was £18,018-17-5 or £2-9-9 per ton. This is a considerable improvement on the two preceding half years and results in a much larger profit than the Directors had anticipated. While the price of copper fell, the costs of production decreased considerably. The Directors have announced their intention of paying a dividend of 100% on 1 June next and, if accruing profits justify it, another of 100% on the profits of the current half-year. The first of these dividends will be paid out of the balance of £17,799-9-11 which remained to the credit of the profit and loss account on 31 March 1860. If estimates of the profits on copper yet unsold prove correct there will be a further sum of £24,277-2-0 to be added to profits already ascertained, making a gross undivided profit of £42,076-11-11 on transactions to 11 March 1861.</p>

<p>Election Meeting at Kooringa</p>
<p>On Tuesday there was a very full meeting of electors at the Burra Hotel. Dr Mayne was voted into the chair.</p>
<p>Candidates were limited to half an hour to express their opinions.</p>
<p>Mr Clark:</p>
<p>On local concerns he thought the sanitary arrangements and state of the roads were most pressing. He opposed further immigration at the public expense. He said Mr Kingston was substantially to blame for spending money on immigration in the past ten years. Much of this money had been wasted; many had felt compelled to go to Victoria to get work and many roamed the streets of Adelaide in search of employment, while at Gawler and Kooringa there were many who had not earned 20/- per week for many a long day. The district was lamentably lacking in good roads and adequate bridges. He favoured changing the regulations to prevent land jobbers. He though absentees landowners did not contribute their fair share to the Treasury. Education grants were needed for country and suburban schools, but he would not support the withdrawal of the Bible from schools. He favoured the payment of Members of the House of Assembly. He favoured the establishment of circuit courts.</p>
<p>Mr Kingston:</p>
<p>While immigration was presently undesirable, it had in the past been beneficial. Many in Kooringa had benefited from assisted immigration. As for many not being well paid; that may be true, but they were better off than they had been when they accepted the free passage from England. The Burra Directors did not wish to lower wages or to oppose railways or good roads; indeed that had, at their own expense, improved the road between Kooringa and the Light. He believed he deserved some credit for helping to frame the Constitution Act.</p>
<p>[There was a disagreement between Clark &amp; Kingston over whether the latter had purchased land in the Hundred of Clare.]</p>
<p>He did not support payment of Members. Country schools required more assistance than town schools. He favoured reading the Bible in schools. He had supported the erection of the Redruth Court House. Though it needed amendment, the Real Property Act was a great boon.</p>
<p>A letter from J.B. Neales was read to electors by the chairman, essentially restating his positions published on 12 April. He thinks that since Mr Clark has come forward his own chances are diminished, but if the voters continue to wish him to stand he will do so and will attend a meeting at Kooringa if it is desired, but important matters prevent his appearance at this meeting.</p>
<p>[There was then a series of questions from the floor.]</p>
<p>When it was put to the vote it was doubtful whether Mr Kingston or Mr Clark had the majority, but it was eventually decided in favour of Mr Kingston.</p>

<p>Advertisement. To blacksmiths, wheelwrights and others. For sale the lease on the oldest smithy and best business situation in Kooringa. The house and out buildings stand on two allotments with a frontage of 223 ft to Market Square and will be sold in one or two parts to suit purchasers.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 17 April</p>
<p>Master Abernethy the ‘fattest of all fat boys’ appeared at Kooringa on Saturday and Monday.</p>
<p>Professor Kohler will attempt to astonish with experiments in the occult sciences on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>Interest in the coming election has been thoroughly roused after the recent meeting here. It is a pity such meetings are not conducted more quietly and in a more orderly manner. Last night’s was particularly turbulent. After the meeting the police ware needed at a fracas to part the belligerents.</p>
<p>24 April 1861, page 3</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Mine</p>
<p>We understand operations are proceeding in a satisfactory manner. Specimens from the lodes have been sent to Adelaide in the last few days and the captain reports the prospect of an abundance of copper at the 50 fathom level.</p>
<p>26 April 1861, page 2</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 24 April</p>
<p>Professor Kohler’s performances at the Burra Hotel drew large audiences and he managed to delude their faculties into accepting things utterly antagonistic to the laws of nature. His tricks were executed remarkably well. The music of Mons. Linden added greatly to the enjoyment of the performances, despite being provided with a very indifferent instrument.</p>
<p>A week ago Police Trooper O’Brien found the body of a man on the North Eastern Plains. The death occurred some time ago, as the body had been baked by the heat of the sun to a mummy. Hanging on a nearby tree was a glass bottle, on which was scratched the message: ‘No friend – lost in the bush – dying for want of water – November – met dogs ate – Pat Duguller – no more.’</p>
<p>Thus is added one more to those who have perished from time to time in the inhospitable wilds of the interior.</p>
<p>[This death does not appear in SA Deaths CD.]</p>
<p>Two accidents have occurred at the Burra Mine; last week a youth’s arm was broken by a fall of earth and yesterday a man’s leg was fractured when a large stone fell against it.</p>
<p>27 April 1861, page 2</p>
<p>‘Burra’ writes in reference to the death of Pat Duguller suggesting that the hard to read message scratched on the bottle may have read ‘met dogs fate’.</p>
<p>27 April 1861, page 3</p>
<p>Election Meeting at Kooringa</p>
<p>Mr T.S. Porter JP was voted into the chair and introduced Mr Neales, who said:</p>
<p>He supported the continuation of Bible reading in schools.</p>
<p>Supported the Real Property Act.</p>
<p>Wanted land placed on the market where it was wanted.</p>
<p>Was not opposed to taxation on land.</p>
<p>Wished to see sensible economy and a fair day’s work, for which he thought there should be fair wages.</p>
<p>He commented on the inconsistencies in Government expenditure in the district; £130 on roads, £177 on the Court House and £3,000 on the Gaol.</p>
<p>The amount of land sold suggested much more should have been spent in the district.</p>
<p>The Government must support schools in country areas.</p>
<p>While not wishing to see the total end to immigration, he thought it was not required at present when many were unemployed. It should bring people when labour was needed.</p>
<p>Many miners had gone to the gold diggings in Victoria, but he felt they would return to the discoveries of copper at Wallaroo.</p>
<p>He favoured some protective duties for colonial goods.</p>
<p>Personally he would rather be independent than be paid as a Member of Parliament, but he conceded that country members had greater expenses and should be recompensed for travelling etc., consequently he would not oppose a bill for payment of members, though personally he did not require it.</p>
<p>He did not think that at present an expensive railway to Burra was required.</p>
<p>He favoured District Courts and the payment of jurors.</p>
<p>As a buyer of shares he had been connected with the Burra Mine since 1845.</p>
<p>Mr Dale then tried to speak, but there was much confusion and difficulty in making himself heard over it. He sought to prove that Mr Kingston had said that 7/- a day was too much for a working man. He then proposed Mr Neales as a fit and proper candidate. Mr Kingston was also proposed and when put to the meeting a show of hands favoured Mr Neales.</p>
<p>30 April 1861, page 2</p>
<p>The late death in the bush.</p>
<p>A careful interpretation of the inscription scratched on the brandy bottle suggests the message: ‘No friends – lost in the bush, November – dying for water – meat dogs ate - Pat Dugall or Dugalley.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. A shepherd came in from Mr Vickery’s station on Friday and asked Mr Wilkinson, chemist, for some medicine for his wife. Mr Wilkinson offered to go and see the wife, but the man said that was not necessary and Mr Wilkinson prescribed according to the symptoms. When the man arrived home he found his wife was dead. Mr MacDermott sat as coroner and Mr H. Corey was elected foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>John Paynter:</p>
<p>Was the husband of the deceased who had been ill for about ten years. She had last seen a doctor when they were living at the Sturt. About eight days ago she had complained of a very bad cold. He had fetched some medicine and afterwards she had seemed better. His duties took him away all day and when he returned yesterday his wife was much worse again. She did not want the doctor, but in the evening he went in for some medicine and when he returned she was dead. Deceased had complained of a pain in her side ever since one of her confinements in England, when the doctor had said the child had grown to her side.</p>
<p>Sarah Elizabeth Paynter:</p>
<p>The deceased was her mother and had complained of great pain and weakness in her back since Tuesday week. She was taken worse last night and witness had gone to Vickery’s for medicine. Deceased had gone into a cold sweat and was still. She went to Vickery’s and Miss Vickery and Hallett’s servant returned with her. She had been alone with her mother when she died. [Other symptoms are given.]</p>
<p>Dr Mayne:</p>
<p>Had seen the body, but it was not easy to conclude the caused of death. It was possible dysentery was the immediate cause. He thought death was from natural causes and the jury found that deceased had died from visitation of God, from natural causes.</p>
<p>[Hannah Paynter died 26 April 1861 at Wildoto aged 34.]</p>
<p>Election meeting at Kooringa</p>
<p>Dr Maurau chaired a meeting on Saturday evening for Mr G.S. Kingston, but the room was filled with partisans for both candidates.</p>
<p>Mr Kingston:</p>
<p>Was in favour of continuing grants in aid – at least for country schools.</p>
<p>They could perhaps be discontinued in the city and suburbs where schools could be self supporting.</p>
<p>Teachers would not be allowed to inculcate sectarian opinions, but the Bible might be read without comment.</p>
<p>He supported the principle of immigration, but would not bring out migrants when the labour market was already oversupplied.</p>
<p>In the Register Mr Dale was reported as saying that Mr Neales had insisted that workers be paid 16/- a day when he had big building works underway and the master builders threatened to stop work in order to lower wages. This was not true. Mr Neales had no building contracts under way at that time and like most men built when wages were affordable and stopped when they rose to 16/- a day.</p>
<p>Mr Kingston endeavoured to explain that he had reduced the expenditure on the Redruth Bridge in order that the £300 saved might be expended on the approaches.</p>
<p>Mr Neales had said that he (Kingston) had absented himself from the House when the mineral leases were being discussed. This was a disgraceful accusation, as Neales knew that on that day his wife had died. He disapproved of the present mineral leasing arrangements, which favoured the capitalist over the working man.</p>
<p>Mr Dale then mounted the platform and the meeting became a scene of confusion and disorder. A question and Kingston’s answer could not be heard.</p>
<p>Mr Dale accused Kingston of having told certain tradesmen that Dale had been paid by Dr Browne for supporting the Land Bill. Kingston said he did not recall doing so, but he was in the House when Dr Browne admitted having spent £10 in expenses to Gawler and Hindmarsh, when he had been accompanied by Mr Dale as supporter of this measure.</p>
<p>Dale then read a letter from Dr Browne denying any payment to Dale for his support.</p>
<p>Kingston’s response could not be heard in the confusion that followed. After a period of personal recriminations and so much noise that no coherent understanding of proceedings was possible, Mr Dale moved a want of confidence in Mr Kingston and this was carried. After cheers for Neales and groans for his opponent the meeting abruptly ended without even a vote of thanks to the chairman for his services.</p>

<p>Election Notice</p>
<p>M. MacDermott SM as Returning Officer for the district of the Burra and Clare, gives notice that he will, at the Burra Hotel on 2 May, declare the names of those persons duly proposed and seconded for election to the vacant seat in the House of Assembly.</p>
<p>Election Notice. John Clark thanks his supporters for election to the House of Assembly, but advises that he has decided to retire from the contest following consultation between his supporters and those of Mr Neales. It has been decided that Mr Neales should go to the poll and consequently his withdrawal will increase the likelihood that Mr Kingston will not be returned.</p>

<p>Election meetings at Mintaro are reported.</p>
<p>Mr J.B. Neales and Mr G.S. Kingston had meetings at different venues.</p>
<p>Mr Dale chaired Mr Neales’ meeting.</p>
<p>J.B. Neales:</p>
<p>Control of expenditure must reside in the Lower House.</p>
<p>Did not support the Real Property Act because of its imperfections, but in principle it is an excellent idea and would support amendments to perfect it.</p>
<p>Squatters must give way to more productive agriculture, but they should not be forced to buy land and do not approve of sale of land by auction.</p>
<p>Approves of assisted immigration especially to bring out relatives of colonists when of a suitable class, but only when the employment conditions in the colony warrant it.</p>
<p>Prefers indirect taxation.</p>
<p>In favour of good roads.</p>
<p>Have sunk upwards of £14,000 in mining.</p>
<p>Would like to see mineral lands available almost free to working men and smelting houses dotted around like flour mills so they could make good returns.</p>
<p>Not in favour of secular education. The Bible must be used in schools – the Catholic version in theirs and the other sects theirs.</p>
<p>Was for free distillation.</p>
<p>Favoured the American system of payment of members’ travelling expenses.</p>
<p>Dr Webb proposed Mr Neales and this was carried.</p>

<p>Special services were held last Sunday for the Sunday school of the United Presbyterian Church. Rev. W. Davidson preached and 40 students were examined. Rev. T. Lloyd conducted the evening service. Tea and public meetings were conducted the following day.</p>
<p>The election is creating considerable interest and there have been public meetings, together with electioneering placards, canvassing and other manoeuvrings. At an open air meeting on Saturday afternoon Mr Dale was the principal speaker and on Monday evening there was a meeting of Mr Kingston’s supporters, composed chiefly of Germans.</p>
<p>6 May 1861, page 3</p>
<p>William Dale writes denying the report in the Register that he disturbed the Kingston meeting at Mintaro. An elector asked him a question and some commotion broke out when he refused to answer, eventually doing so through the chair as a necessity. [He also says about eight voted against Mr Kingston, rather than two as reported. He can name most of them if required.]</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 8 May</p>
<p>From nomination day on Thursday to the election on Monday the town was busy with electioneering. Throughout the day there was a throng at the Burra Hotel where voting took place. At the close of polling at 5 p.m. 597 voters had exercised their franchise. Yesterday at 10 a.m. the returning officer began overhauling the boxes. By 1 p.m. it was determined that the Kooringa box had given Mr Kingston a majority of 29 votes. By 4 p.m. all but the Mudla Wirra box had been counted and Mr Kingston was 36 ahead. The last box arrived by the evening mail and resulted in a victory for Mr Kingston by 61 votes. The result was declared today.</p>
<p>Numbers of people are still leaving the town for Wallaroo and elsewhere. Today a large party left for the Northern Mines and another lot for Wallaroo. If this continues much longer it will soon make a large impact on population here.</p>

<p>Port Adelaide Smelting Works</p>
<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Company has begun the erection of its smelting works at Port Adelaide. The first timber was laid on Wednesday by Mr G.W. Hawkes SM. The building will initially consist of a single house 276 ft long by 50 ft wide with six smelting furnaces and two refineries for handling copper from the Burra Burra Mine. It has been ascertained that a considerable savings will be made by bringing the ore to the port instead of taking the fuel to Burra. It is also intended to then increase the size of the works to handle ore from Wallaroo and from other parts of the colony. The smelting house will then be doubled in width with two other double houses of equal dimensions to be erected as required. The structure is a simple galvanised iron roof set upon wooden pillars twelve inches square with iron principals; the side partially enclosed with galvanised iron. A tramway will bring coal from the wharf and another will be carried above the furnaces to deliver the ore. It is expected to complete the present stage by 1 September. The cost is expected to be between £7,000 and £8,000.</p>
<p>30-40 smelters will be employed and the number of coal ships employed by the company is expected to double. The annual wages bill of more than £5,000 will benefit the community as ‘Cousin Jacks’ spend their money liberally. During the next twelve months it is expected the expenditure of the company will not fall short of £100,000. I have been told the expenditure on traffic alone to the company in one year was £60,000. Mr Hamilton’s sound judgement in building at the port will provide a great saving. Wallaroo will doubtless send much ore and enable the company to further extend its operations. After the ceremony at the site there was a luncheon at the company’s offices provided by the host of the Port Hotel. There were the usual toasts. Many had asked why the smelter was not at the port. The company had originally formed its contract with the Burra Company, but for some time the manager, Mr Hamilton, had argued that the difficulties of land transfers and the expense of carriage made it more profitable to locate at the port. With the discoveries at Wallaroo they would be able to purchase ores from the various companies and sent refined copper home instead of ore. The iron content of ores from Wallaroo would make it advantageous to smelt them together with ores from the Burra.</p>
<p>[The toasts and accompanying comments are printed.]</p>

<p>On Friday evening a meeting was called to take steps for collecting money for the Indian Relief Fund, but due to the short notice it was only thinly attended. It was adjourned to Monday so that ministers could announce it at church. A tolerably attended meeting was held on Monday in the Kooringa Wesleyan Hall. The town’s ministers attended and W.H. Wilkinson took the chair. He had received a description by the last mail of a devastating famine in India, the very locality of the late war. He outlined the nature of the distress. At least 10 millions were in need and 500,000 tons of rice would be needed over the next three months. A committee was set up to collect funds for Indian Relief. [Members are listed.] Steps are to be taken to canvass the town for support.</p>
<p>The town has recently been visited by thieves who have entered houses of several citizens while the owners were absent. Rev. Lloyd’s house was entered during church hours on Sunday and the thieves took a writing desk and a few shillings in cash. At T.

<p>There is a petition against the new pound that has been created some four miles from Kooringa, on the grounds that most of the cattle impounded belong to Kooringa people and it is both a nuisance to have to collect them from four miles away and unnecessary, as there was already a pound at Kooringa.</p>

<p>The first anniversary of the new Bible Christian Chapel was celebrated last Sunday. Sermons were preached by Mrs Roberts and in the afternoon by Rev. J.D. Whittaker. The building was filled to overflowing on each occasion. On Monday a tea meeting was held in the old chapel, where more than 300 enjoyed ‘the cup that cheers, but not inebriates’.</p>
<p>Monday was a public holiday as mid-summer’s day (or rather mid-winter’s day). There was a dinner commemorating the anniversary of the Miners &amp; Tradesmen’s Club. The Masonic Lodge also held a dinner and the following day saw the opening of the new Redruth Bridge. The work for this was commenced on 25 January and work proceeded steadily except on one occasion when workmen had to wait for the delivery of material. It is constructed on the laminated arch principle and has a span of 68 ft 6 inches, being built askew so that the span on the square is 60 ft. The abutments and wing walls are of coarse hammer-dressed rubble masonry. From these spring four laminated arches or ribs, bearing a framed wooden superstructure, surmounted by the roadway, which is formed of two transverse thicknesses of three-inch gum planking laid diagonally. The side rails are of white painted deal. The whole reflects great credit on the builders; Messrs Burgoyne &amp; Baker for the carpentry and Messrs Tiver and Cole for the masonry. I understand the cost is £1,400. The only drawback is the approaches, the fences of which are but rough post and rail in contrast to the finished workmanship of the bridge itself. The bridge has been available for use by the public since 6 June, though the official opening was not performed till the 25 June. The appointed time for the ceremony was 2 p.m., but a sharp shower delayed it somewhat. Soon, however, ‘two wagons from the Smelting Works, loaded with copper ore from the mine, took up their station on and near the bridge, followed by a train of vehicles and horsemen. A carriage then drove up, containing Mr W.H. Challoner and Mr., Mrs and Miss Barker, who was the lady appointed to perform the ceremony. Mr. Challoner having led up Miss Barker, she was introduced by Mr. Burgoyne, who then handed her a gaily-decked bottle of wine, which she smashed on the rail, naming the bridge “The Redruth Bridge.”’</p>
<p>Cheers were then given and Mr Barker, on behalf of Mr A. Macaulay, District Surveyor, who was unavoidably absent, declared the bridge open to the public.</p>
<p>About 50 attended the following dinner at the Aberdeen Hotel, though the absence of the music usual for such occasions rendered portions of the event somewhat tame and flat. Some excellent songs did enliven the toasts.</p>

<p>Notice. The Directors of the Royal Mining Co. give notice that the requisition calling upon them to call an extraordinary general meeting for the purpose of deciding the propriety of dissolving the company, having been signed by shareholders with only 1,334 shares and not 4,413 shares, being the three fifths of shares provided for by clause 58 in the Deed of Settlement, they are precluded by clause 112 from proceeding to the business proposed, if they call a meeting. They have therefore decided not to do so. Only 28 out of more than 300 shareholders have signed the requisition, which has been lying for signature at the office foe six weeks.</p>

Great loss would be entailed on many who had erected homesteads along this route if it were not so declared. The matter was referred to the Surveyor.</p>

<p>Last Monday a shoemaker named Thomas Murphy was brought before the SM charged with being concerned in the late burglaries in Kooringa. When apprehended he was carrying a skeleton key and at his lodgings were found other tools used in burglaries. The tools match the marks found on Mr Lloyd’s drawer and Mr Hoskin’s cashbox. When Murphy’s alibi for the time of the burglaries was deemed inadequate he was committed for trial in Adelaide.</p>

<p>The season is one of the wettest known here. The creeks continue to flood and the thoroughfares are deplorable. Crops are sheering to behold whether in garden or field. Pasture is abundant and vegetables, fruit and dairy produce is in abundance.</p>
<p>The Central Road Board seems not quite to have forgotten us and I am informed some men are actually employed on the line between Kooringa and Kapunda. It is certainly time.

<p>On Wednesday 17 July a meeting was held at the Burra Hotel on the subject of immigration. About 400 workingmen and tradesmen had assembled by 8 p.m. Mr H. Corey was voted into the chair. J. Jenkins spoke against resuming immigration at the present time with sufficient labour in the colony and nothing in prospect to justify more immigration. He moved a motion in line with this view. Mr Baker seconded and spoke about the prevailing unemployment. Mr Moody supported the motion at some length. Mr Vivian’s motion to prepare a memorial against resuming immigration and the collection of signatures for the same was carried without dissension. A motion by Mr Smith and Mr Dennis setting up a committee to implement this was also passed.</p>
<p>The meeting then went on to discuss the conduct of Mr Justice Boothby in reference to several decisions in the Supreme Court. Several censured His Honour’s antagonism to the Real Property Act as well as his general conduct. It was resolved to petition the House of Assembly on this subject.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 23 July a public meeting at the Burra Hotel was held to consider the state of the town with a view to improving the state of the streets. Attendance was poor and it was therefore decided to consider it a preliminary meeting. It was resolved to form a committee to communicate with the Mining Company and the Smelting Company and the Central Road Board and to report back to a further general meeting. The committee comprised Messrs Drew, Dawson, Pearce, Winnall, Challoner, Killicoat, Bath, Wilkinson (National Bank), Anderson (Australasian Bank) and Dr Mayne.</p>
<p>The road between Kooringa and Adelaide are appalling. There is a paucity of travellers and this with the holes and quagmires has resulted in the mail cart running only two or three days a week, with the mail carried on horseback on other days.</p>

<p>New Mode of Smelting Copper Ore</p>
<p>The Yatala Smelting Works near the Alberton railway station have been idle for a long time. Now a portion of the building is occupied by Mr R.V. Rodda, a son of the late Captain Rodda. He is experimenting with a new way of smelting copper and other ores. The patented method controls the temperature so as to fuse the metal without melting the other minerals contained in the ore. The ore is then crushed and washed; the latter process separates out the copper, which is then sent to the refinery. Mr Rodda is being helped by Mr John David, a practical copper smelter, who expresses himself astonished at the results. The ore being used is from Kapunda and contains 33% copper. Mr Rodda now intends to try some poor ore from Burra at 3 to 9%. Though not yet perfected, he has hopes that the process will make great savings in time and expense.</p>

<p>John Chewings writes from Woorkoongoree 11 July querying the right of bullock drivers to turn out their stock where they think fit and to remain as long as they like. He says he had had 50 to 60 bullocks turned out near his head station in the last three weeks. The drivers claim the right to turn them out where they please. He says sheep farmers customarily like to preserve some feed near their head station for their horses.</p>
<p>He also complains that woodcutters are felling a lot of timber, but then selecting only the best for carting; thus perpetrating a great waste of timber. He feels that within another season all useful timber for 40 miles north of Burra will have been felled. He feels that hose who get the timber should also remove the rubbish.</p>

<p>Kooringa Post &amp; Telegraph</p>
<p>A ‘Kooringa Tradesman’ writes 24 July:</p>
<p>It seems that our Legislature has decided that the Post Office shall be moved to the Telegraph Station despite a memorial to the Postmaster-General and a petition to the House of Assembly. Our objection was not so much against the amalgamation as against the position of the Telegraph Station as a Post-Office. Had there been no Post-Office at Redruth it would have been near the truth to say that the Telegraph Station was in a central position, but there is one at Redruth and it is untrue to say that the Telegraph Station is central to Kooringa. The nearest house is 150 yards away. It has now been said by a competent engineer that it will cost £100 to make a safe road for the mail cart to go and return and the Government proposes to spend a further £200 to provide Post-Office accommodation at the Telegraph Station. The interests of economy might be served by locating both departments in an office in a central part of Kooringa. Let the Station-master keep his suburban residence and attend the office in office hours. For every Redruth resident who would have to come a little further to send a telegram there would be 100 Kooringa residents or more who have to call at the Post-Office.</p>

<p>I cannot let the letter of ‘A Kooringa Tradesman’ pass without attempting to vindicate the truth. The nearest house is 50 yards away, not 150. The road approaching the Telegraph Station is the very best piece of road in the township, and almost everyone expresses his entire satisfaction at the decision come to by our worthy representatives.</p>

<p>I have to announce that the men working on the Adelaide road are making some progress. They are now at the entrance to Kooringa, which was as dangerous a place as anywhere excepting Allendale. It was stony and full of holes and at journey’s end when the horses are jaded and darkness renders progress more perilous. I hope they will not stop at the town’s entrance. Now is the time to continue operations in the main street. The mud has dried and the work would just have time to set before summer turns it to dust.</p>
<p>The ant-Boothby agitation has lost none of its force and seems to be in everyone’s mouth. The prevailing opinion seems to be that something certainly out to be done to decide the question and assert out constitutional rights.</p>

<p>While correcting other ‘Chemicus’ has denied the truthfulness of the petition signed by 250 inhabitants, including most of the tradesmen of the town. The nearest building is the Institute and a measurement to Dr Maurau’s door will find me much closer to truth than ‘Chemicus’. As to the ‘best road’, it may be good for foot traffic, but ask the mail driver if it is safe to turn a coach and four at the Telegraph Station.</p>

<p>Last Sunday the anniversary of the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel was celebrated. Preachers were Rev. H. Cole of Strathalbyn and resident minister Rev. J.D. Whittaker. There was a full attendance on each occasion. On Monday the usual tea meeting drew so many that four sittings were needed. About 400 were catered for. At the public meeting many were compelled to stand. Rev. Whittaker announced that this would be his last anniversary here as he was leaving the colony for New Zealand in about eight weeks. The amount raised during the services was £55-17-111⁄2, reducing the debt to £210.</p>
<p>Last evening a meeting was held to consider the advisability of petitioning the Governor to dissolve the present Parliament on account of their recent decision regarding Mr Justice Boothby.

<p>The new German Lutheran Church at Redruth was opened last Sunday. At about 10.30 a.m. a procession was formed at the home of Mr F. Vollmer and proceeded from there to the church. First came a party of men forming the choir, then 12 young girls dressed in white and bearing the Bible, the key to the church, two wax tapers, a miniature crucifix and the communion service. These were followed by the Prediger [Preacher] who was to officiate; Rev. Fiedler of Hahndorf. A number of Germans brought up the rear. At the church the choir ranged on either side of the door and sang a hymn. A solemn benediction and extempore form of consecration followed, pronounced by the Pastor, who then opened the door and everyone entered to entirely fill the building.</p>
<p>The choir sang a piece and the Pastor offered a prayer. The 415th hymn followed, after which the Pastor chanted the Augsburg Confession and gave a discourse on the Epistle for the day; the 5th Chapter of Galatians. After the singing of the 460th hymn the Pastor delivered an impressive inaugural address, after which there was further singing during which a collection was made. The Pastor then delivered a doctrinal address and an exposition of part of the 6th Chapter of Matthew. The service closed with singing. An evening service was also held with a large congregation. All the proceedings for the day were conducted in the German language. It is understood that it is intended to open a day-school in connection with the church; the master to conduct divine service until the arrival of a minister from the fatherland.</p>

<p>A lost child. Yesterday afternoon at about 4 p.m. a five-year-old boy named Hilton was found to be missing from his home. A search was organised and despite the effort continuing all night no sign of him was found. At midday today a public meeting organised an even more extensive search and every place has been searched and waterholes dragged. So far there has been no sign of the boy and it can hardly be hoped he has survived the fatigue and exposure he must have experienced. [See, however, 21 September, page 3 .]</p>

Whittaker preached in the open air as the chapel was far too small to accommodate the congregation. In the evening there was a full attendance when Mr J. Paull preached. The following day’s tea meeting was also well attended.</p>
<p>The Mechanics’ Institute has begun another series of lectures. On Monday the first in the series was delivered by Mr J. Burnell on James Ferguson; the shepherd boy and the philosopher.</p>
<p>The exodus to Wallaroo continues. I have seen three parties take their departure this week.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. J.B. Anderson JP conducted an inquest on Thursday into the death of William Peters who committed suicide the previous evening.</p>
<p>Susan Peters; wife of the deceased:</p>
<p>He committed suicide at about 5 p.m. He had been in a very low sate after going unsuccessfully to seek work at Black Point about five weeks ago. He had never threatened or attempted suicide before. He had been looking for the lost child. When he came home I asked about the child and he said he was all right. They had got him out of a well and he had seen him carried home. He went into the bedroom and soon afterwards my little girl said there was something wrong with him. I called out to him and then went in and found him on the floor, bleeding. She had not quarrelled with her husband and he was not addicted to drinking. He had been acting strangely since his return from Black Point and she had thought it prudent to conceal his razor and such things, though she did not think he would cut his throat.</p>
<p>John Rowe:</p>
<p>Heard Mrs Peters scream and rushed over there. As I reached the door Mrs Peters rushed out of the bedroom and fell on the floor in front of the chimney. Saw Peters on his back with blood gushing from his throat. Saw him move his foot a little and then came out. Knew Peters quite well for about two years. He had been rather strange since his return from Black Point. Had not spoken to him in the last fortnight. He had never mentioned that he had contemplated suicide.</p>
<p>James Opie gave evidence corroborating Rowe’s.</p>
<p>Dr Mayne gave evidence of examining Peters who was dead when he arrived. Deceased had severed the principal arteries in his neck. The cut had extended from ear to ear down to the spinal column. Deceased was about 37, but did not look so old. Had not previously attended him and so know nothing of his peculiarities.</p>
<p>The jury decided that the deceased had committed suicide whilst under a fit of temporary insanity.</p>
<p>[William Peters died 19 September 1861, Kooringa aged 30. BISA says his wife was born Susanna Bennetts and had previously been married to John Hodge. They arrived in Australia in 1851 and John died 26 November 1858 at Kooringa aged 36. They had a daughter Elizabeth born c. 1851. Susanna (or Susan) married William Peters at Kooringa 18 November 1860 at Kooringa. At the time of Peters’ suicide she was pregnant and Susan Ann Peters was born 12 February 1862 at Kooringa. Mrs Peters married John Bone (30) on 16 August 1862 at Kooringa and they had a son, John Bone born 23 December 1863 at Kooringa.]</p>
<p>The lost boy was found this morning at Princess Royal, about seven miles from home, having been two days and two nights without food or shelter. He was brought in by a man named Martin and was hailed by a vast number of people assembled to witness his happy return.</p>

<p>The Burra Institute held its annual meeting on Friday last. J. Burnell took the chair.</p>
<p>The secretary, Mr J. Lee reported a decline in membership, which he ascribed to the departure of people to Wallaroo and elsewhere, the depressed state of trade generally, the want of new books and the cessation of the lecture series during the winter months. It is expected that a large consignment of book will arrive from England in the next three months. The Governors of the SA Institute recently offered to pay half the travelling expenses of some very talented lecturers and as a result the committee has planned eight and possibly twelve lectures for the coming year. In the last year eight lectures were given and six of them were gratuitously presented. The committee regrets that it has been necessary to expend another large sum in alterations and additions to the Institute. However, the extra windows in the reading room and the erection of a closet are expenses that will not recur, at least for some years. There will be some expense in the coming year because the building is not in as good a condition as they would like it to be. Income for the year:</p>
<p>Telegraph Office rental £16-10-0</p>
<p>E. &amp; A. Copper Co. donation £10-10-0</p>
<p>Government Grant £37-8-0</p>
<p>Proceeds from lectures £17-13-6</p>
<p>Subscriptions £49-9-0</p>
<p>SAMA donation £10-0-0</p>
<p>Catalogues disposed of £1-2-0</p>
<p>Total £142-2-2</p>
<p>[Approximately!]</p>
<p>The expenditure has totalled £185-11-5, of which the additions and alterations accounted for £37.</p>
<p>There are 803 books in the library.</p>
<p>Elected for the coming year’s committee were: Messrs Roach, Corey, Dennis, Hoskins and Burnell. J. Lee continues as Secretary.</p>
<p>It was resolved that a debating society be formed.</p>

<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Chapel held its anniversary services last Sunday. Preachers were Rev. W. Butters of Adelaide in the morning and evening and the Primitive Methodist minister Rev. J.D. Whittaker in the afternoon. The tea and public meetings were largely attended on the following day. Rev. T. Lloyd delivered his report on the financial situation of the church. They had a debt of £980-10-11.</p>
<p>On Monday a large number of men and lads, who were ore dressers at the Mine, struck for higher wages, and on account of the non-allowance of the usual ‘sist,’ which is a sort of advance given weekly for maintenance until the periodical ‘pay-days’.</p>
<p>It is said that operations at Karkulto Mine are about to be discontinued.</p>
<p>Accident. On Saturday night Mr Wearne was driving on of the cabs that run between Kooringa and Redruth, when it collided with another cart and a woman and child were thrown to the ground, where the child sustained serious injuries.</p>

<p>The late lambing season has been very productive with rates as high as 95%. The yield of wool this year has also been very good and cleaner than in former years. Many farmers are already sending off their clip, with many loads going through the town this week.</p>
<p>The new National Bank building is proceeding rapidly. It promises to be one of the finest buildings in Kooringa. The additions and alterations to the Telegraph Station following its amalgamation with the Post Office are almost completed and will soon be ready for occupation.</p>

<p>Mr R.Y. Wilkinson of Kooringa has promised to send a fine collection of Burra specimens.</p>
<p>Mr Ayers said he had received five cases of specimens from the Burra Mines and had addressed circulars to all those likely to have specimens, requesting them to forward them during the month, for transmission to England.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. [Editorial] The half-yearly report of the Directors was read an adopted at the meeting on Wednesday. The Directors regretted that they could not report such an abundant yield of copper as in past similar periods. This is due to a reduction in the number of men employed rather than a decline in the quality of the ores raised. The total raised in the six months to 30 September last was 5,133 tons of the usual average percentage of copper; c. 22%. This is a reduction of about 1,100 tons compared with the previous six months. There has also been a falling off in the value of copper during this period. Six months ago the price was £95 per ton and twelve months ago sales were effected at £105 per ton. In the last two months only £85 had been realised at Adelaide, though this had recently risen to £90 per ton. We may hope that this signals and end to the decline.</p>
<p>The gross quantity of ore raised in the year to 31 March 1861 was 12,237 tons at a cost of £138,299-4-11 or £11-9-0 per ton. This realised £154,897-16-1 or £12-13-2 per ton, leaving a profit of £16,598-12-0 or £1-7-2 per ton. This is the smallest profit hitherto obtained.</p>
<p>The Directors have declared a dividend of 100% for 4 December next and have an estimated undivided profit of £21,493-16-1 based on the prices of copper ruling in England and India at the last mail. With increased prices in prospect the next half-yearly report may be expected to be as favourable as any of its predecessors.</p>
<p>The Captain’s report for the Burra Mine is highly satisfactory. He speaks in promising terms of the Karkulto Mine, though the Directors had expected better of it and are at present not carrying on any extensive operations there. The number of hands employed has decreased by 126 in consequence of the fall in the price of copper making it necessary to restrict operations to those likely to yield profitable returns. At present the total workforce is 762.</p>
<p>During the half-year the Directors have gone to considerable expense in testing Henderson’s process for reducing copper ores. The results are not conclusive, but were so far satisfactory that it was only the large outlay required for setting up a necessary works that made the Directors hesitate in adopting it. It may yet be of benefit in the treating of poorer carbonate ores.</p>

<p>A Bolt. Dr Mayne was visiting a patient last Monday in a light buggy, which was left in the care of a small boy, when the horse took fright and bolted off at a frightful pace, around a corner an up by Paxton Square. The boy was here either jerked out of the vehicle or jumped. The horse turned off the road behind the United Presbyterian Church and passed over several gutters, breaking the breaking the shafts and bending the axle. The horse was then free to run about the town without restraint. Fortunately the boy was not hurt and nor was anybody else. The vehicle sustained surprisingly little damage for so light a buggy.</p>
<p>An Accident. Yesterday a young woman, the daughter of Mr Riggs, one of Captain Killicoat’s shepherds, was out on horseback when slack girths allowed the saddle to slip and she was dragged along the ground some distance before escaping the stirrup. Mr Wilkinson was sent for when she was taken home and he found a dislocated clavicle. There is no news of her progress since.</p>
<p>There is a shortage of shearers for this season and some stations have only just commenced operations.</p>
<p>The striking ore-dressers at Burra Mine have mostly returned to their work.</p>

<p>Kooringa United Presbyterian Church</p>
<p>The first anniversary of this church was celebrated last Sunday and Monday. The morning service was conducted by the Primitive Methodist minister Rev. J.D. Whittaker, but due to the oppressive heat, boisterous wind and dust there was only a very small attendance. In the afternoon Mr W.H. Wilkinson Sen. officiated, but the same conditions resulted in an even smaller congregation. The wind dropped a little in the evening and a somewhat larger congregation attended the service conducted by Rev. W. Davidson. Monday began in a similar fashion, but the conditions improved from about 1 p.m. and so the tea and public meetings were pretty well attended, all things considered. Mr James Burnell read the annual report. The evening’s proceedings were enlivened by items from an amateur choir comprising Messrs B.C. Evans, Herbert, Pearce and Bennett.</p>

<p>Extreme weather. On last Thursday, Friday and Saturday it was very still and warm, but during Saturday night a north wind arose, which continued all Sunday as a violent storm with frightful clouds of dust and oppressive heat. At 2 a.m. on Monday morning the violence increased to such a degree that many roofs and buildings were damaged. This storm continued till noon, when the wind veered to the west, clouds covered the sky and two sharp showers of rain and hail laid the dust, after which the afternoon and evening were very pleasant.</p>
<p>The anniversary of the United Presbyterian Church was held on Sunday with three special services, but due to the inclement weather the attendance was small. The tea and public meetings on the following day were, I believe, more successful.</p>
<p>On Sunday three special sermons were preached in the Bible Christian Chapel by Mr S. Keen of Adelaide on behalf of Home Missions and there is to be a public meeting on the same subject tonight.</p>
<p>Bishop Short preached at St Mary’s last evening and confirmed about a dozen young persons.</p>
<p>A rumour yesterday reported a man had fallen down a shaft at the Bon Accord Mine and been seriously injured, but the event turned out to be trifling.</p>

<p>Treatment of Poor Copper Ores [Reprinted from the Mining Journal, 24 August 1861.]</p>
<p>This subject is receiving as much attention in SA as here. Mr R.V. Rodda of the Burra Burra Mine has discovered a process promising results no less important than those contemplated by Mr Henderson. He does not claim to deal with ores as low as 11⁄2%, which is Mr Henderson’s minimum, but3% ores are certainly not below his treatment. The advantage of his method is that it can deal with higher grade ores as well and is likely to effect a considerable saving in their conversion to copper. Mr F. Sinnett (the inventor’s agent) says in a letter to the SA Register that the process will be tested at the Yatala Smelting Works on a satisfactory scale and the requisite works are now in progress there.</p>
<p>It has also been affirmed by a competent authority that the brick material at Wallaroo is equal to any found in England or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The weather continues very changeable. Most of the past week has been colder and wetter than usual for the time of year. On Sunday there was a violent storm accompanied by thunder and lightning. The rain came just in time to deluge the congregations going home from church. The weather is also unfortunate for the recently shorn sheep.</p>
<p>Various mischievous pranks have been played lately to the annoyance of many. Mr Splane’s ‘golden boot’ was torn from the front of his shop and cast into the yard behind the Police Station. A spring dray of Mr J. Parks was wheeled into the creek, besides a number of other pranks.</p>
<p>Although business is slow, the town appeared busy this week due to the quantity of coal and firewood being delivered to the Mine and the Smelting Works.</p>
<p>Two or three parties left for Wallaroo this week and others are preparing to depart.</p>

<p>Port Adelaide Smelting Works</p>
<p>The furnaces of the new smelting works erected for the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. at Port Adelaide were lit on Saturday 2 November for the first time. At 3 p.m. some 30-40 people were present when Mr Hamilton set fire to the No. 1 furnace and the visitors set light to the other six. Captain John Hart proposed the success of the venture, which was toasted in champagne. Mr Malliphant superintended the erection of the works by Messrs English &amp; Brown. Provisions have been made for the erection of three other buildings of similar dimensions. The smoke from the furnaces is led to an immense chimney stack that rises 161 feet and can be seen from all parts of the plain and from far out to sea. It rests on a concrete foundation 41 feet square atop deep piles driven into the ground. It is 8 ft square at the top. The first 12 feet are stone and the rest in brick. It is estimated that the stack and the connecting tunnel consumed some 300,000 bricks. It has been found that the foundation has not subsided by more than four inches, and that evenly. It is expected that in about a fortnight the furnaces will be charged. In the future coal will be carried by tramway trucks directly from ships to the furnaces.</p>

<p>‘A Warning Voice’ writes to the editor:</p>
<p>He complains that those employed at the Burra Mine are being compelled to share in the loss resulting from the fall in the copper price or a decline in the yield by reduced wages, but should prosperity return and dividends increase they are not to share in them; ‘for the Directors would then do what they have always done, namely avail themselves of every chance to lower wages. I am sure you will think “ ‘It’s werry unekle,’ as my father says, when his grog isn’t half and half, ‘It’s werry unekle, Samivel.’ ” I am, Sir, &amp;c., A WARNING VOICE.’</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held yesterday at Gum Creek Station before Mr M. MacDermott SM to inquire into the sudden death of Donald Ross who had resided there.</p>
<p>Margaret Ross:</p>
<p>Am wife of the deceased. He went to Adelaide last Thursday week and returned last Friday in very poor health. He had spent two nights in Kapunda and took some medicine there. He had great difficulty in breathing, but would not keep to his bed. He had pains in his lower chest and sometimes spat up blood. He died at 1.25 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Alfred James Williams:</p>
<p>Last Sunday I called to see deceased who was up and dressed. He looked very feverish. I asked if he had been drunk in Adelaide. He said not, but from his appearance I thought he had been. He complained of a bad cough and difficulty in breathing and pain in the lower part of his chest. He had medicine from Kapunda. I made him go to bed and applied a mustard poultice to his chest. He did not appear dangerously ill at this time.</p>
<p>Dr T.H. Mayne:</p>
<p>Having seen the body I am of the opinion he died from inflammation of the lungs. There were no marks of violence visible on the body.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of death from natural causes.</p>
<p>[Donald Ross died 4 November 1861 at Gum Creek Sheep Run aged 45.]</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodists this week held their annual conference meetings here. There were special services and a camp meeting. On Sunday morning a large number of people paraded the streets and stopped at street corners for prayers and exhortatory addresses. They then proceeded to the Paddock; a vacant piece of land north of the township, where the rest of the morning was devoted to devotional exercises. In the afternoon a large gathering was held there for the same purposes.</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the Auxiliary of the British and Foreign Bible Society, Kooringa Branch was held on Tuesday 5 November in the Bible Christian Chapel. The proceedings began at 6 p.m. and by 7 p.m. the spacious building was completely filled. Mr MacDermott SM was voted into the chair and Rev. W. Davidson read a detailed report of the year’s activities. This year the branch issued 250 Bibles and 247 Testaments compared with 231 and 116 respectively the year before. In this year these issues comprised 483 English volumes, 13 Welsh and 1 German. Arrangements have been made to open a depot at Black Springs. Income this year was £116-10-0 exclusive of sales at the depot. (£96-2-3 came from subscriptions.)</p>
<p>[The report continues at some length with further details of the work of the organisation.]</p>

<p>Rodda’s Patent for Reducing Ores</p>
<p>Under the ordinary smelting process the copper or other ore is melted, stone and metal together and as a consequence the whole mass has to be raised to the enormous temperature required for the fusion of the stony portions of the ore. Under Mr Rodda’s system the stony portion is not fused at all. The temperature is raised sufficiently to fuse the metallic portions of the ore so that they run into granules within the body of the stone, from which they are they separated by crushing and washing. A company is in the process of formation with the view of erecting works at the Burra Mine to process ore by Mr Rodda’s process. A vast quantity of ore has been accumulated there over the years because it is of too low a concentration of copper to be economical to smelt by the traditional method. It is expected that a large profit can be made from its treatment. Arrangements have been made between the promoters and the SA Mining Association for the transfer of some 50,000 tons of inferior ore at a low price. The treatment of this ore would give value to what is now valueless to the colony. If successful it could be expected that similar works would be erected in the far north mines where transport costs mean that at present only the richest ores are presently worth mining.</p>

<p>The Royal Mining Co. held its AGM at the Gresham Hotel in Adelaide on Wednesday 13 November. Unusually, Mr H. Ayers attended to exercise power of attorney for Mr Bryden. After some discussion about the acceptability of this, he was admitted. Directors Mildred, Abrahams, Mildred and Poole were retiring by rotation and Mr Wright by ballot. At the last half-yearly meeting a motion was passed requiring the Directors to take the steps necessary for winding up the company. This required a meeting to be called by a requisition of shareholders controlling three fifths of the shares. Despite efforts to collect the necessary signatures on the requisition, this was not achieved. The Directors had an agreement with Rough and Francis to work their lease at Karkulto. Rough &amp; Francis have abandoned their lease because of lack of sufficient capital. They have sold the ore raised to the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. and this is sufficient to cover costs, but as it has not been convenient to remove the ore as yet, the matter has not been finalised. The grass is let for £30 per annum.</p>
<p>The Directors have consulted with interests at the Yorke Peninsula mining area, but have not thought it prudent to close any arrangements there. The Directors have visited the Kanmantoo and Paringa Mines and as a result decided to decline an offer made by the Kanmantoo proprietors, but are negotiating with the proprietors of the Paringa Mine and home soon to come to a satisfactory conclusion. They have also obtained a right of search of Sections 840, 842 &amp; 843 Franklin Harbour. They have abandoned all hope of realising any satisfactory result from their sections at Emu Flats and have resolved to sell them by auction. Considering the little being done at present the Directors recommend the meeting take advantage of the 34th clause of the deed of settlement and reduce the remuneration payable to themselves by one half, say to 30/- per meeting.</p>

<p>On Sunday last Rev. J.D. Whittaker preached his last sermon at the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Chapel. He is about to leave for New Zealand. Tea and public meetings were held the following day to farewell him at which Messrs Way &amp; Davidson delivered fine valedictory addresses. Mr Whittaker replied at some length with an emotional address, at the end of which many were sobbing and weeping and all were profoundly moved by the touching scene. Captain Roach handed to Mr Whittaker a purse of 60 sovereigns as a testimonial of their general esteem. (Mr J. Roach provided the tea gratuitously.)</p>
<p>Last Sunday the Wesleyans opened their new chapel at Westbury, a rising township adjoining Copperhouse. Rev. Lloyd of Kooringa preached morning and evening. W.H. Wilkinson Sen. preached in the afternoon. There was a good congregation at each service, though inclement weather doubtless kept some away. There were tea and public meetings the following day.</p>
<p>The harvest has now commenced in earnest and large quantities are passing through the town. Wool carting has not yet finished, with several loads here at present in transit for Kapunda and Adelaide. Business remains slow.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 20 November</p>
<p>There have been numerous complaints recently, especially from the inhabitants of Redruth, about the closing of two or three cross roads north of the township. This has diverted much traffic from Aberdeen and Redruth, as travellers from there are unable to get onto the Mount Remarkable Road without a considerable detour, thus depriving the two townships of the benefits of the North Road traffic. It is time the Ranger or other responsible person enquired into the matter.</p>
<p>On Friday a little boy called Prior fell into a well and sustained a rather severe contusion to the head. I have not heard how he is progressing.</p>
<p>We have had a foretaste of summer. On Saturday it was close and sultry and on Sunday it rose to 94°F in the shade. Sunday was also hot and sultry until relief came in the form of a thunderstorm with one or two sharp showers at about noon. The afternoon and evening were cooler.</p>

<p>Accident. Mr H. Dawson, saddler, was riding a young horse up Commercial Street when it either shied or bucked, throwing the rider to the ground with some violence. Mr Dawson was insensible for some time, but on his recovery it was found his injuries were not severe, though he was much shaken and is likely to feel the effects for some months.</p>
<p>During the week Mr G.E. Hamilton, Government Surveyor, with some assistants, has been surveying the line of main road through this township and Redruth. I hope something will be done in the way of making as well as marking the road, lest our principal thoroughfare again present the same dismal spectacle next year as it hitherto has done as soon as the rains set in.</p>
<p>[Note that this survey resulted in the creation of the modern line of the main road to the northwest of Young Street; the road known as Watt Road. The map below shows the original town survey and the new line of road shaded in. It bears the note: ‘Portions of the within Lots 36, 37, 59, 60, 61, 74, 75, 76, 90, 91, 116 &amp; 117 have been taken for New Roads Vide confirmation of Road Order in Gazette of 28 August 1862.’</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. This afternoon Mr MacDermott SM held an inquest on the body of George Pascoe who had been killed by falling into a quarry at Hampton the previous evening. A. Motley was elected foreman.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Rogers:</p>
<p>Was the last person to see the deceased before the accident. He came to our house between 7 &amp; 8 p.m. to buy stores as usual. It was not very dark when he came, but he stayed an hour and it was quite dark when he left. He was not sober, but neither was he very drunk. I advised him to take the road by the gully and not to go by the quarry, but he said he would take the old road. I told him to take a light and turned to get a candle. He was going towards the quarry and as I turned I heard him fall into the quarry. I took the candle and ran down while giving the alarm, but no one seemed to come. I called the deceased, but got no answer. Found him head down among the stones with his legs up. He was bleeding at the mouth and nose and I thought him to be dead. I ran out of the quarry and gave the alarm again. Mr Lewis came to his assistance and I went to get others. I could scarcely tell if he was living or not for some time, but he finally died at 7 a.m. this morning. Several men came and helped to remove the deceased. The road he used was a little path beside the quarry and he always came that way when he came to buy stores. The quarry was about thirty feet deep where he fell. It belonged to Mr Tiver and had never been fenced.</p>
<p>[John Lewis’s evidence is essentially corroborative. He adds that when he lifted the deceased he moaned and so he knew he was then still alive and sent someone to fetch a doctor.]</p>
<p>Dr Maurau:</p>
<p>Was sent for to attend the deceased between 9 &amp; 10 p.m. last night. Had difficulty in finding Rogers’ house in the dark. Afterwards saw the deceased in this house. He was suffering severe concussion of the brain and could not speak. His eyes were insensible to light. No bones seemed to be broken and there were few external injuries. When I came again this morning he was dead. I have no doubt death resulted from recent injury to the brain. I identify the deceased as George Pascoe. He was a widower and has left two sons too young to look after themselves. The deceased smelled strongly of drink. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death and expressed the feeling that steps should be taken to have the quarry fenced.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the amalgamation of the Telegraph and Post Office are at last completed. The Post Office moved this afternoon and today’s mail was delivered to the new location. It is strange that the move was not made earlier because the office has been ready for almost a month past.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Young Men’s Class celebrated their first anniversary last evening with a tea and public meeting; both of which were well attended.</p>

<p>[The style is a very verbose one with much elaboration.]</p>
<p>The train to Gawler passed by the villages of Enfield, Gepps Cross, Dry Creek and Little Para, but leaves them a considerable distance off to the right.</p>
<p>At Gawler the town has recovered from the extension of the railway to Kapunda. There are several large shops, inns and the ponderous steam flour mills of Messrs Duffield and Harrison. There are also some half a dozen agricultural machinery makers. The legal and medical professions are well represented, as are religious establishments and the Institute. There are two banks and a telegraph station.</p>
<p>From Gawler to Kapunda the railway traverses inferior agricultural land and the line itself is rough. The Kapunda station is elegant and excellent. Kapunda is an amalgamation of a group of towns; Kapunda, Victoria, Helston etc. It is seen to advantage better by approaching it by road rather than from the railway station.</p>
<p>Beyond Kapunda much of the land is pastoral, though agriculture is growing. The mine employs 300 men and 40 boys. The population of the town is about 2,000. The houses are built of a soft stone that hardens on exposure. The ‘Sir John Franklin’ is a fine-looking hotel and the North Kapunda hardly less so. Stores have increased since the arrival of the railway. There is a National Bank and the professions are well represented. The Telegraph Station and Post Office are together. There are one or two agricultural implement makers. The churches are well represented and the newspaper the Northern Star is published there.</p>
<p>Continuing north we came to the dingy-looking build we discovered to be Forresters’ some 10 miles on. We stayed overnight before going on to Riverton. We entered up an area of sheep runs with an extensive and productive agricultural area off to the left around Macaw Creek, Rhynie, Baker’s and Humphrey’s Springs.</p>
<p>Riverton is laid out to be an extensive place. There are several stores, one of which includes the Post Office. There is a Court House, a Bible Christian Chapel and a church on the hillside. An excellent steam flour mill has been erected. There is dome good farming country to Saddleworth where there is a dilapidated-looking inn, a small chapel and Messrs Kingsborough &amp; Seikmann’s store and nothing else. From there we headed to Auburn.</p>
<p>[Continued 10 December 1861.]</p>

<p>Rough Notes on a Journey Northwards</p>
<p>Auburn has a pretty location where two branches of the road from Adelaide meet; one via Baker’s Springs and the other via Riverton. It is small, but rising with a new Bible Christian Chapel and a Church under construction. There is a school and a Post Office in Mr Bleechmore’s store, but a new Post Office and Telegraph Stations are soon to be erected. George Field has a steam flour mill. The Rising Sun Inn is the best of country inns.</p>
<p>Then we continued to Leasingham, Watervale and Penwortham where there is Messrs Metcalf &amp; Roach’s steam flour mill, a few houses, the Derby Arms, a Wesleyan Chapel and a Church.</p>
<p>Clare had four places of worship; Wesleyan, Church of England, Scotch and Roman Catholic. Clare does extensive business at the heart of an agricultural area with considerable dairy produce too. It has Mr Hannaford’s steam flour mill.</p>
<p>Pastoralism becomes prominent north of Clare and towards Burra – Hill River, Bungaree and Gum Creek Stations and a whole string of others towards the north. Unfortunately, as a community Clare is divided into two factions who are automatically at odds with each other over every issue.</p>
<p>Clare to Burra was a journey through exclusively sheep country. Mr Fisher’s Hill River Station is bare and barren of timber and given the amount of traffic between Clare and Burra, it was surprising that there was no public house for more than twenty miles until the Cross Roads Inn.</p>
<p>[The writer then has a long digression on the desirable attributes of country inns.]</p>
<p>At Burra the first house is the Burra Hotel, which has extensive accommodation. There are only another two public houses [in Kooringa] and they have comparatively limited resources.</p>
<p>There are numerous stores, offices and shops, ‘none of them, however, either for style or elegance, justify eulogy’.</p>
<p>The National Bank now in course of erection will be a neat building and the Institute and the Telegraph Office are decent structure, but their location towards the mine means they do not contribute to the appearance of the town. The only handsome building in the town is the new Bible Christian Chapel. The other places of worship; the Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist Chapels, the Church of England and the Welsh Church are ‘in notorious disproportion to their own relative importance denominationally, and to that of the place’.</p>
<p>As to the nature of the town itself:</p>
<p>‘&hellip;no neat fenced gardens or cultivated enclosures of any kind; the streets and roads (if such you may term them, for they have never cost anything to make or maintain) a vast crying nuisance from the filthy accumulations they contain; the Burra Creek itself, which at the bottom of the town runs through it about east and west, overcharged with ore shines from the mine dressing floors; the whole place nearly shut in by the adjacent hills from all prospect, and those hills themselves divest of tree, or plant, or trace of cultivation, or anything to relieve the dreary spectacle – picture to yourself, if you can, a locality embracing the foregoing characteristics, nothing overdrawn, and you have Kooringa, a scene of the wildest and most cheerless desolation in our experience.’</p>
<p>There is a population of some 4,500 souls and ‘there ought to be a flourishing and handsome town’.</p>
<p>But it seems it is the result of the owners refusing to alienate the land except on short term leases of 21 years. The Bible Christian Chapel is the exception, having obtained a 99-year lease. The town has no Council machinery of any sort and hence its squalor. Adjacent are Redruth (with the Court House and Gaol), Aberdeen and Copperhouse and these, while a slight improvement, ‘partake more or less of the withering aspect of their original’. The reducing population due to the migration to Wallaroo has the storekeepers in violent competition for business. [Continued 23 December.]</p>

<p>Mr J.H. Clark delivered a lecture on Douglas Jerrold at the Burra Institute on Monday evening. The attendance was not such as to encourage a gentleman who had travelled from Adelaide to deliver the address. Rev. W. Davidson chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>The teachers and scholars of the Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School presented a handsome testimonial to Mr J. Skews on Sunday afternoon upon his resigning as secretary due to his promotion to the ministry.</p>
<p>On Monday there was a tea meeting held to celebrate the opening of a place of worship in connection with the Wesleyan Church on the outskirts of the township. It and the following public meeting were well attended.</p>
<p>The Annual Bible Christian Bazaar was opened on Monday in an unoccupied store adjoining Mr T. Richard’s.</p>

<p>The wet and boisterous weather that has afflicted the rest of the colony was also felt here. It is altogether unprecedented for this time of the year.</p>
<p>At the Burra Mine a very promising lode has been discovered at the 70 fathom level and running southward under the hill opposite the Burra Hotel. I hope this turns out better than the last two or three ‘valuable discoveries’.</p>
<p>A disgraceful ‘tinkettling’ case on the occasion of a recent wedding has given rise to a court case. One of the pranksters has been charged with creating a disturbance and breaking the peace. The case has been remanded to the Full Court.</p>

<p>The Burra Burra Mines present an impressive scene with huge steam pumping engines, whims, stamps and an array of mining apparatus. The officers’ and agents’ residences are of a respectable description and are situated at the head of the mine out of the way of the activity. The mines have been in operation for almost 17 years.</p>
<p>Their capital comprised 2,464 shares of £5 each or a total of £12,320/</p>
<p>Profits declared amount ti £677,000</p>
<p>16,607 acres of land valued at £31,157-0-10</p>
<p>Buildings at Burra worth £24,900</p>
<p>Buildings &amp; Works at Karkulto £20,800-10-4</p>
<p>The nett value of ore and cash on hand was £27,832-8-10.</p>
<p>The nett profit in 161⁄2 years was £813,120 equal to £330 per share or for every £100 originally invested a dividend payment of £5,500.</p>
<p>Until lately they were raising 12,000 tons of ore p.a. at 22% copper.</p>
<p>More recently this has fallen to about 10,000 tons p.a.</p>
<p>Smelting also employs many.</p>
<p>Kapunda, which is of almost the same age, yields c. 3,000 tons p.a. of 22% copper and employs about 340 persons inclusive of smelters.</p>
<p>Leaving Burra we went via the Karkulto Mine owned by the Burra proprietors. It is of promise, but so far has been attended with considerable loss in working.</p>
<p>In the Tothill’s Creek area there were some patches of crop amid the pastoralism and this increased towards Kapunda. None of Sod Hut, Black Springs, Apoinga, Steelton, Marrabel, Hamilton or Allen’s Creek warrants special mention.</p>
<p>At Kapunda the people hope for an extension of the railway to the River Murray, but they are not in favour of its continuation northwards. [The writer considered their attitude to be based on a misconception and believed Kapunda would benefit from the northern extension of the line. He also believed it should reach Burra via Clare, although that would add more than twelve miles to the journey.]</p>
<p>[The rest of the article is of a more generally speculative nature with the author’s views on the railway question, the colony’s immigration policy and the opening up of new agricultural land.]</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 24 December</p>
<p>Last Thursday evening Mr G. Droege delivered his very interesting and instructive lecture on New Zealand at the Burra Institute. The audience was very small due in part to the dramatic entertainment at the Burra Hotel, but chiefly to a general lack of interest in such matters.</p>
<p>At the Burra Hotel the dramatic entertainment was provided by the well-known polyphonist [i.e. a ventriloquist] H.J. Hall. He was quite well patronised on this and subsequent evenings.</p>
<p>The annual examination at Mr Bennett’s school at Redruth took place last Thursday. Few except those nominated as examiners attended. The pupils acquitted themselves well.</p>
<p>On Friday Mr J.R. Stephens’ school was examined. This was pretty well attended by parents and friends. Again the pupils acquitted themselves very well. In the evening Mr Stephens entertained the students and their parents with a magic lantern show.</p>
<p>The Kooringa Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its special anniversary services last Sunday. Sermons were delivered by Rev. Mr Standrin and Rev. W. Davidson. The annual tea and public meeting will be held on Thursday 26 December.</p>
<p>There seems little bustle in preparations for Christmas this year. Indeed the weather has been so unlike the characteristics of even an Australian Christmas that we cannot realise the season is upon us. ‘In fact, it don’t seem like Christmas at all.’</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 31 December 1861</p>
<p>Christmas brought perfect weather this year for family gatherings, musical parties, picnics or excursion trips.</p>
<p>On Wednesday nearly all places of worship had special services and on the next day the Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its anniversary. In the afternoon the pupils and teachers walked in procession through the town before partaking of tea and cake in the chapel. Parents and an immense number of visitors had tea after them before the public meeting.</p>
<p>On Thursday The Local Court sat for Full Jurisdiction at Redruth to hear several interesting cases that saw the court house unusually crowded.</p>
<p>Tobias Pierce was charged with threatening to stab Corporal Mallon while in performance of his duty. The Corporal had been sent to remove Pierce after a disturbance at a house and he resisted the police and committed the offence for which he was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the Redruth Gaol.</p>
<p>In the case of those accused in connection with the nuisance at the recent tinkettling, both sides employed counsel, but the Bench failed to be impressed by the arguments for the defence and fined each offender £2 plus costs.</p>
<p>7 January 1862, page 3</p>
<p>Burra Races were held on 1 &amp; 2 January. Since the Burra Mining Co. has fenced in a large paddock on the Copperhouse flat, it was necessary to move the racecourse a little distance to the southward to ground not so flat or as large as previously used. The numbers attending were fewer than previous years. This I attribute mainly to the loss of population since the last meeting. [The races are then reported.]</p>
<p>With the exception of one or two bacchanalian brawls tolerably good order prevailed through both days’ proceedings. No accident or misadventure marred the races.</p>

<p>Obituaries. Two men have been found dead, having succumbed to the extreme heat north of here. One was found 15 miles beyond Parnaroo and was last seen alive on Monday week, when the driver of Dawson’s mail cart overtook the deceased and another man named Wall, on the road. Wall asked for a ride as he was weary and had some distance to travel. Deceased did not want a ride, as he was headed for Waite’s Station some six miles off the road. When left he seemed all right, but has since been found dead near the same place.</p>
<p>The other body was found between Parnaroo and Stewarts, but there are no other details except that he was a young man who was in Kooringa about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>[Neither of these deaths seems to be registered judging from SA Deaths CD, but see the SA Register 31 January 1862 for more on one of them.]</p>
<p>I am informed that arrangements are being made to present a handsome testimonial to Corporal Rollison, who has lately been removed from here to Wellington. I am sure many will join in because he has rendered active and efficient service as a trooper while here and has earned the respect and good will of all who have come to know him.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. On Wednesday afternoon Dr Mayne held an inquest into the death of an infant named Sophia Webster who was found dead this morning in bed.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Webster:</p>
<p>I am the mother of the deceased child who was about five weeks old. I last saw her alive when I put her to bed yesterday evening at about 8.30 p.m. When I awoke this morning and was about to take the child in my arms, I found she was dead. The body was lying just below the pillow, but not under it.</p>
<p>Edwin Webster, miner:</p>
<p>I am the child’s father and having heard my wife’s evidence have nothing more to add except that the child has been kindly treated and was well when we went to bed.</p>
<p>Dr Maurau:</p>
<p>I was called to see the deceased a little after 6 a.m. this morning and found her quite dead. She might have been dead about an hour. She was frothing at the nostrils with feet drawn up and hands clenched as if she had been in convulsions. There were no marks of violence and she was covered only with a sheet. All evidence suggests death by convulsions. The jury returned a verdict of death by visitation of God.</p>
<p>[This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD, but the birth of Sophia Webster is registered on 14 December 1861 at Kooringa to Edwin &amp; Mary Ann Webster nee Symons.]</p>
<p>Obituary/Death. An inquest was held this morning before Dr Mayne JP at the White Hart Inn, Redruth [sic: actually at Aberdeen]. Charles Wolfe, a hut-keeper at one of Hallett’s northern stations, had been ill for two or three weeks and on being brought down for medical advice, had died at Gottlieb’s Wells (McCulloch’s) and was then brought on to the White Hart.</p>
<p>Israel Lowe:</p>
<p>Knew deceased and saw him alive about 7.20 a.m. yesterday morning at Gottlieb’s Wells. He was then seriously ill and I had brought him in a cart from Mr Hallett’s station to seek medical attention. He had been ill three or four weeks. He was a hut-keeper at one of the out stations and had to draw water for 1,600 sheep. He came to the head station and said he was too ill to carry out his work. He had great difficulty in breathing, but no cough. He got worse on the way down and I thought he would die at Paratoo. He took no nourishment on the journey. He had difficulty in swallowing and took only water. I don’t believe he was ill-treated by anybody and died naturally. When we left the station he had two small bags, a handkerchief, a pocket-book and an order for £1-10-6. I have not given them to the police because he gave them to me for raking care of him. I asked him if he had any friends or relatives and he said: ‘There is nobody that cares for me, and I care for nobody.’</p>
<p>He said all I had to do for him was to drive the cart as gently as possible; which I did. When I first saw him he looked like a healthy man, but I noticed he breathed with difficulty.</p>
<p>Dr Maurau:</p>
<p>I examined the body of the deceased Charles Wolfe. I found no marks of violence. The body has the appearance of a person who has been ill two or three weeks. I have heard the evidence of Israel Lowe and believe the appearance of the body corroborates his account of the illness and death of the deceased. I believe the deceased died from inflammation of the lungs and has probably had a disease of the lungs and perhaps also of the heart, for some time. I have not moral doubt that he died from natural causes. The jury returned a verdict of death by the visitation of God, but also commented that there had been neglect with regard to seeking medical aid.</p>
<p>[The SA Deaths CD must be in error in recording the death of Charles Wolfe as 28 February [sic] 1862 at Gottlieb’s Well North, residence Winnininnie aged 30.]</p>

<p>This week the town was visited by Burton’s troupe of equestrians and gymnasts. When they arrived on Monday morning after placards had circulated announcing their coming, the appearance of the dragon car (containing the band) caused a sensation. Many were enthusiastically awaiting their arrival as a break in the monotony of everyday life, but some of the tradesmen must have viewed the dragon as a monster that would consume the loose cash that might else have flown their way. The entertainment was generously patronised on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>One of the two poor men found dead in the north has been identified as a poor half-witted fellow named Henry Dart. He seems to have been wandering about without any fixed purpose or means of subsistence. Trooper Ayliffe, who went up to investigate, satisfied himself that the man died from sunstroke and afterwards buried the corpse near where it was found.</p>

<p>Obituary. Last Thursday saw the funeral of the late Mr Humphry of Baldino [sic: Baldina]. The gentleman had been ill for some months, so his death was not unexpected. Large numbers of persons in carts and on horseback went out for the funeral. The funeral procession, headed by Rev. W. Davidson, and consisting of 21 vehicles besides a number of horsemen, left Baldino at about 3 p.m. and proceeded to the United Presbyterian Church in Kooringa, where Rev. Davidson read the funeral service. The cortege then again formed with the Freemasons (of which the deceased was a member) walking on foot to the cemetery, where another brief ceremony was held. Crowds of people thronged to see the funeral. Unfortunately there was another sensation when, just as Rev. Davidson was about to commence the service in the church, Dr Mayne, who was present, was suddenly taken ill and had to be taken home. The attack proved to be apoplexy and paralysis and was so severe that it left the gentleman completely prostrated. Doubts were entertained of his recovery, but since then he has improved slightly, though he remains in a precarious state. These events cast quite a gloom over the town and the doctor’s professional services are greatly missed.</p>
<p>[James Humphrey died 18 February 1862 at Baldina aged 53.]</p>

At the tea the following day one table was furnished by a group of young bachelors, who announced their candidacy for marriage in a placard placed on their table. The proceeds of the event removed a long standing debt.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held before J.B. Anderson JP at the Miners’ Arms on the body of a shepherd named Peter Murphy. The deceased was employed by Mr Barker of Baldino [sic: Baldina] and was found in his watch-box on Friday morning quite dead. The police brought in the body. Evidence was given that deceased had a heart disease and on Thursday evening had over-exerted himself trying to catch one of his sheep. Dr Morgan was of the opinion that this was the cause of his death. The jury decided that Peter Murphy had died from the visitation of God.

<p>The newly built National Bank is now almost ready for occupation. It stands on rising ground facing Market Square, at the bend of Commercial Street leading to the Institute and the Telegraph and Post Offices. It is built of neatly pointed stonework, with stuccoed pilasters, window and door dressings and is surmounted by a bold cornice, also stuccoed. The roof is galvanised iron. The interior, though plain, is in keeping with the exterior and is replete with every convenience for the public and the manager. The public room is 25 x 20 ft and is fitted with handsome cedar counters. The manager’s room is 12 x 17 ft and is similarly fitted. There is a strong-room, drawing-room, dining-room, good bedrooms, a kitchen and other domestic conveniences besides a large underground rain-water tank at the rear. The private entrance is at the side of the building and the public entrance at the corner. The contractor was Mr Tyrie of Adelaide, supervised by Mr George Bradley, the clerk of the works. Edmund W. Wright was the architect. When finished it will have cost about £1,500 and adds considerably to the appearance of the township and will make some of our other pretentious building look all the shabbier.</p>

<p>Our Mines [Editorial]</p>
<p>One of the most useful chapters in the South Australian Handbook [by J.B. Austin] is that dealing with the mines of SA. It begins with the Burra Burra Mine and after describing how it became the possession of the SA Mining Association the author say that the first blast was made in the rock on 29 September 1845. The employees then comprised ten miners, a smith and a captain. Since then work had continued almost without intermission to the extent of providing employment for upwards of eleven hundred individuals and indirectly to many thousands. Despite the crude methods of operation in the early years, the product of the first six years amounted to nearly eight thousand tons of copper ore, of a richness not met with before in mining history. Despite having to cart these ores over one hundred miles of unmade road to a port and then ship them to a market some sixteen thousand miles distant, the profit from working the mines for that period amounted to £438,552. The company’s working capital in September 1845 had been about £1,500. In 1851, however, the prosperity of the company was checked by the discovery of gold in the adjacent provinces. By the early part of 1852 the number of workers available at the mine had fallen from 1,042 to 366 and later to only 100. The pumping engines were stopped and the water allowed to rise in the mine to its natural level. Operations were limited to the dry levels. This situation prevailed till the latter part of 1854 and might have continued longer has not the Governor H.E.F. Young and his Government taken prompt measures to introduce a large number of Cornish copper miners. Work recommenced in January 1855. To date there has been no falling off in the supply of ore, though increasing depth has reduced the profit margin. For many years now the annual production has been between 10,000 and 13,000 tons, of from 22-23% copper or about 2,500 tons of metallic copper, worth to the colony at least £225,000 p.a. Direct expenditure within the colony by the company since operations started amounts to £1,640,000, of which upwards of £1,000,000 has been in wages. The gross profit stands at £836,000, of which £677,000 has been divided among shareholders, £147,840 added to the capital stock and £10,560 remains undivided. The greatest number of hands employed was in 1859, when it amounted to 1,170 individuals. Common labourers’ wages have fluctuated from 25/- to 40/- per week and of miners from 35/- to 60/-, with tributers sometimes making very much more. Mechanics wages have varied from 42/- to 112/- per week.</p>
<p>The Kapunda Mine was the next mine in importance until the discoveries recently on Yorke’s Peninsula. The first ore was raised here on 8 January 1844 and in December 1849 the first smelting furnace commenced work. When the Victorian gold rush began operations were suspended and not resumed until March 1855, when miners returned in large numbers. Up to the close of 1861 a total of 35,280 tons of 21 cwt had been raised at an average of 20% copper. In the past year 3,306 tons averaging 18.15% were raised. The deepest level is 60 fathoms and tributers are working to 50 fathoms. Almost all workings are on the original 80 acre section 1271. Other sections are also owned. There is a smelting works and all ore raised is now reduced to fine copper before shipment. 595 tons were shipped in 1861. The year’s expenditure was £48,300; most of which was in wages and fuel.</p>
<p>On Yorke’s Peninsula the total quantity of ore raised at the Wallaroo Mine to 31 January 1861 (1862?) was 11,370 tons of which 5,370 have been shipped to Melbourne and Sydney with about 6,000 tons remaining at the Wallaroo Smelting Works. These works at present have ten reducing furnaces and three refineries, with ten extra reducing furnaces are being erected. The ores average 15-25% copper. About 400 men are directly employed at the mine and about 90 at the smelting works. Two steam engine of combined power of about 180 horses are already employed here and three more of a united 195 horse-power have been ordered.</p>
<p>At Moonta there were 68 men working in February and about 200 tons of ore had been shipped, while 450 tons were awaiting shipment. Other mines noted on Yorke’s Peninsula are those of the New Cornwall Mineral Association and the Duryea Mining Co.</p>
<p>In the Far North the Great Northern Mines began in June 1860 and have been pursued with vigour. At first all work was by hand, but a steam engine, whims and ore crusher is expected to be operational by May. 600 tons or ore have been shipped to England and 90-100 tons is in the course of shipment. The carbonates and grey ores here have mostly been from 27 to 30% copper, and some as high as 40%. The deeper levels have sulphuret ores. Up to 149 workers have been employed.</p>
<p>Other mines referred to in the book are those of Strathalbyn, the Bremer and Kanmantoo from which silver, lead and copper have been obtained.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. On Sunday Mr MacDermott SM held an inquest into the death of William Nicholls, who had died from injuries received the previous Thursday. Joseph Bray and Robert Northy were riding with the deceased on Thursday from Dryhill Pound to Macnamara’s Pound near Redruth. Nicholls had wanted to try the speed of his horse. He asked the pair to ride ahead and he would catch up. This was done, but on reaching them Nicholls checked his horse suddenly and he either fell or sprang off the animal while it was still in motion. He was still holding the reins and was jerked forward onto his head, rupturing a blood vessel in the brain. He lingered in great pain till Saturday night or Sunday morning and leaves a wife and three children.</p>
<p>[William Nicholls died 30 March 1862, Kooringa aged 32.]</p>
<p>On Monday news was received that a shepherd on Mr Chewings’ station had committed suicide by taking poison. The police have gone out and an inquest will be held.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. On Thursday morning W.H. Challoner presided at the White Hart Hotel at an inquest on the body of Edward Connelly or Donnelly. Duncan Stewart and Alfred Warming stated that on Sunday evening they had called at the hut of the deceased, who had given them some food. They then went outside and the shepherd came home soon afterwards. While they were talking to the shepherd the deceased came out and walked towards the sheep yard at the back of the hut. They and the shepherd entered the hut and the deceased soon followed them, but had no sooner sat down that he went into convulsions. They administered an emetic, but the poor man died within about 15 minutes. John Lambert, the shepherd, gave corroborative evidence and said he did not know what had prompted the taking of the poison. Dr Morgan said he was decidedly of the opinion that the deceased had died from strychnine. The jury returned a verdict of ‘Temporary insanity’.</p>
<p>[Edward Donelly died 29 March 1862 Chewings Station aged 30.]</p>
<p>A lad named Nicholas Moon was severely injured last week by a savage dog. He was out with the son of Samuel Hall, driving cows, Moon cracked his whip and the dog flew at his face, inflicting four severe wounds about his eye and tearing an inch of skin from his skull. Young Hall asserted that Moon had been teasing the dog, but Moon positively denied that. Under the New Dog Act His Worship ordered the dog destroyed and inflicted the minimum fine of £2.</p>
<p>[It is likely that this lad is Nicholas Moon born c. 1852, the son of Nicholas Moon a Cornish Miner who arrived in SA in 1858. The family moved to Wallaroo.]</p>

<p>SA Mining Association [Editorial]</p>
<p>The AGM of the association was held Wednesday 17 April [sic: Wednesday was the 16 April]. The retiring Directors were Messrs Jaffrey, Kingston, Beck, Boord and Peacock, who were all re-elected.</p>
<p>Their report is highly encouraging. Although the sale of copper in the last half-year has been smaller than was anticipated, the yield at the mine continues to be good. The profits up to the end of the financial year terminating in September last were better than expected. Despite employing fewer hands, the quantity of ore raised in the past half-year closely approximates that of the preceding six months. 4,835 tons were raised at an estimated 22-23% copper. There has also been a general reduction in expenditure after the Directors resolved to limit operations to works absolutely necessary and those likely to yield a profit. The total number of persons employed has fallen from 888 last April to 684.</p>
<p>The ore raised from March to September 1861 was 5,123 tons at a cost of £53,898-3-7 or £10-10-5 per ton. This realised £63,477-15-8 or £12-7-10 per ton, leaving a profit of £9,579-12-1 or £1-17-5 per ton. This result as to profit per ton will no doubt be regarded as fully justifying the Directors’ determination to reduce costs. It will not be known until the next half-yearly report what the cost per ton has been to raise the ore in the last six months, nor can the profit from its sale be known until it has been sold. Nevertheless the shareholders will doubtless approve of the Directors’ success in reduction costs. The Directors look to being able to declare a dividend – the first during the present year – in June next. The funds for this come from £9,579-12-1 profit on copper up to September last, £985-9-5 from rents and £7-5-0 from fees to give a total of £12,070-1-9 available for dividend in June next.</p>
<p>Expectations based on the best advice from England and India are that there will be an extra £12,947-13-2 to add to existing profits, derived from operations to 31 March 1862. This would bring the undivided profit to £25,017-14-11. However, since the report was printed the February mail has indicated a fall in the price of copper that has caused the price here to fall from £93-10-0 to £90 per ton.</p>
<p>The Captain’s report indicates that everything at Burra is satisfactory. At Karkulto 8 tons of copper ore was raised in the past month and 120 tons of iron ore. There are 11 men working there on tribute. The Directors have no intention of expanding operations there unless there is a discovery of a good course of copper ore.</p>
<p>Employees:</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Tributers 256</p>
<p>Tutworkmen 77</p>
<p>Miners on own account &amp; timbermen 45</p>
<p>Total miners 378</p>
<p>Mechanics 21</p>
<p>Engine drivers 8</p>
<p>Weighers &amp; fillers 8</p>
<p>Stablemen 8</p>
<p>Variously employed 15</p>
<p>Ore Dressers (Men) 117</p>
<p>Ore Dressers (boys) 23</p>
<p>Labourers 36</p>
<p>Whim &amp; cart boys 37</p>
<p>Officers including surgeons 13</p>
<p>Total at Burra 664</p>

<p>Storekeeper 1</p>
<p>Total at Karkulto 15</p>
<p>At Adelaide Office 5 5</p>
<p>Total overall 684</p>
<p>This is only a little more than half those employed in 1859. It seems that much of the savings comes from ceasing to explore for copper in new directions. When in 1859 the number employed exceeded 1,200 the profit for the two half years was £4-8-3 and £3-7-8 per ton. Now it is £1-17-5 per ton.</p>
<p>The Directors are anxious to find some way of turning their low grade ores to account. They are still in correspondence with Mr Henderson on the subject of his patent process for the reduction of low grade ores. This is a matter which would interest many proprietors of mines across the colony.</p>

<p>Good Friday was observed as a public holiday. While pious worshippers went to church, some lovers of nature headed out into the country for the day.</p>
<p>A temperance demonstration had also been organised. The supporters rallied at the Bon Accord Mine at 1 p.m. where they were joined by the Kooringa Brass Band, which had been hired for the occasion. They then marched through the streets to the Redruth Primitive Methodist Chapel, where Rev. Cole preached a temperance sermon. After that the procession re-formed and they marched through the streets proclaiming their message until eventually returning to the chapel, where they sat down to tea with visitors and friends. A public meeting followed, presided over by Mr Goss and addressed by Rev. Cole and others.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Sunday School celebrated its anniversary on Sunday and Monday. Services were conducted by Rev. J. Hancock and Mr W.H. Wilkinson Sen. In the afternoon the scholars were examined by Rev. T. Lloyd. On Monday the scholars and teachers with a band and flying banners made a procession through the streets before returning to the mission-yard for tea and buns. Shortly before 5 p.m. the public tea began and continued for some two hours. The public meeting in the chapel followed at 7 p.m. Mr R.G. Wilkinson took the chair.</p>
<p>A planned lecture by Mr F.H. Needham on Recollections of the Russian War at the Institute on Tuesday evening had to be postponed sine die due to the absence of the speaker.</p>

<p>Having displayed considerable apathy and procrastination about the coming election, Burra residents are now going about the matter in a desperate hurry. It is now too late for any of the candidates to address a public meeting of electors at Burra. Requisitions to Mr Thomas Graves, Mr Furniss and to Mr A. Jaffrey were all declined. Eventually Mr J.W. Tyler of Princess Royal was prevailed upon to stand, but then J.B. Neales was thought of and he too has come out as the second candidate. Mr S. Stocks has also been thought of and could yet come out as a third candidate.</p>

<p>When Mr MacDermott opened the letters of nomination for election to the House of assembly the first was for J.B. Neales; nominated by John Rogers Warren and seconded by James Burnell. The second was for the same gentleman and so was unnecessary, but in it he was nominated by Frederick Hannaford, seconded by George Duncan. In the next letter J.W. Tyler was nominated by Captain Roach and seconded by Alfred Barker. The last letter nominated S. Stocks, who was proposed by C.H. Webb and seconded by H. Gregg. Mr Tyler has withdrawn and though his name will be on the ballot, the contest will be between Mr Neales and Mr Stocks.</p>
<p>The boy Morley, who I mentioned in my telegram, as having been shot, continues to progress favourably and it is hoped he will recover. He has been in the habit of entering his neighbours’ houses and troubling them with his meddling and importunity. Mrs Bryant, in order to get rid of him, took down a pistol, thinking it to be unloaded and threatened to shoot him. Unfortunately her husband had loaded it without her knowledge and when it was fired a charge of No. 3 shot was lodged in the poor fellow’s face and hand. Thirteen grains entered his face, one of which traversed the upper part of his eye socket and severed a branch of an artery in the corner of the eye. This is the only one giving concern. Mr Wilkinson is treating him and has hopes of his recovery.</p>

<p>Rev. J.G. Paton preached on Sunday at the United Presbyterian Church on behalf of the mission cause amongst the New Hebrides Islands. In the afternoon there was a grand alliance meeting of the Sunday schools in the Bible Christian Chapel. This brought together scholars of the Wesleyans, Presbyterians, Primitive Methodists and Bible Christians. The chapel was densely crowded with children and other visitors. Rev. Paton delivered an earnest and somewhat lengthy address on the subject of missions. In the evening he preached at the Wesleyan Chapel and a local committee has been formed for the purpose of aiding the cause.</p>
<p>Election placards are now everywhere and canvassing is going on so that tomorrow’s election is likely to be brisk and exciting. Yesterday evening a meeting of Mr Stocks’s supporters was called at the Burra Hotel, but it turned out to be a burlesque rather than a reality.</p>
<p>Mr H. Dawson, contractor for the north eastern mail, has lost two of his best horses. When about 15 miles from Chewings’ Station on Saturday, both horses fell down dead. The driver then walked to Chewings and fetched two fresh horses, which had to then run the next two stages in addition to this 30 miles, on account of the horses at the next station being missing.</p>

<p>17 May 1862, page 2</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 14 May</p>
<p>The election took place last Thursday. There was the appearance of a hard contest, with placards and caricatures of opposing candidates conspicuously placed and supporters of each active and assiduous in their efforts. Despite this and the noisy demonstration in favour of Stocks, it was all an illusion. It gave the excuse for a jolly spree, but here Stocks only polled 49 [sic: actually 39] votes to his opponent’s 271. Boxes from other places failed to alter the story and Mr Neales won the seat by a majority of 324.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Bazaar opened today in the schoolroom adjoining the chapel. There are seven well-stocked stalls besides a table for edibles and drinkables and another for trinkets for the juveniles. The money raised is intended to clear the chapel debt.</p>
<p>The Burra Directors have visited the mine and as a result one of the engines has been stopped and 40 hands have been dismissed. This makes the town’s prospects even gloomier than before.</p>
<p>For pastoralists the lambing is far advanced, but as yet we have had no rain and the scarcity of feed is becoming a matter of serious concern.</p>

<p>The Bon Accord Mine may have some good news for the town. The small prospecting party working there has at last found a promising lode of copper ore and sixteen men have been taken on to prove the value of the discovery. If they manage to do so it will be no more than the company deserves, having spent a considerable sum upon the works. A development of this mine would also greatly assist in stemming the present flow of migration from here.</p>

<p>Accident at the Burra Mine. A lad named Kean fell down a shaft 120 ft deep on Saturday. When carried from the scene he was found to have a compound fracture of the leg, a fracture of one arm, dangerous concussion and extensive bruising. He has been in a critical condition for two days and the doctor had but faint hopes of his recovery. Today he is reported a little better. It is surprising that there are not more accidents at the Mine and I suppose there are few mines with comparable numbers of men and boys working that escape with such a comparatively small number of casualties. [SA Deaths CD does not record a corresponding death.]</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held by Mr MacDermott on Friday afternoon at the Miners’ Arms on the causes for the death of W.H. Birbeck, an old and well-known resident of Kooringa.</p>
<p>Emma Nethick:</p>
<p>Went yesterday to the deceased’s office to get my husband’s club-card. Got no response when I knocked, but could hear some noises inside. Called Miss Splane and told her I thought Mr Birbeck was having a fit. Looked through the keyhole and saw Mr Birbeck on his right knee. Mr Splane and Mr Dawson came and sent for the police.</p>
<p>Police Trooper Hunter:</p>
<p>On arrival at the deceased’s office I broke a pane of glass in the window, opened it and gained entrance. Saw deceased on his back on the floor and sent for a doctor. The body was lying apparently dead without any signs of contortions. Unlocked the door and Mr Splane, Mr Dawson and some others entered. There was a tumbler under the table, a piece of paper on the table and two letters in a pocket book; one addressed to the N.G. of the Burra Lodge and the other to Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>The letters were read; they said goodbye to his friends, commended his family to their benevolence and made some reference to Lodge affairs, but said nothing directly of his intention to kill himself.</p>
<p>[Hunter went on to describe searching the clothing of the deceased and that he had found that the chemists (Dyer &amp; Wilkinson) had not sold the deceased poison. Deceased’s wife had some drugs in the house, but believed he had not known where they were. She said the deceased had often complained of heart disease.]</p>
<p>Henry Dawson:</p>
<p>Saw deceased enter his office at about 12.30 p.m. About two minutes later went to talk to him and found the door locked. Asked him to open it and he did so. There was half a glass of water on the table. Spoke with him for about half an hour, during which time Greenwood and Mardon dropped by for a few minutes. Deceased had complained of a pain in his chest during the day. Am aware the deceased had been troubled by money matters for the last three months and there was an affair he had to settle last night. There was some deficiency in the cash for which he was responsible as Secretary of the Lodge. The amount was under £20 and I know he could not make it up, though he said he thought he could get it by the evening.</p>
<p>[The rest of Dawson’s evidence and that of Mr William Splane largely corroborates that already given. John Potter, a spirit merchant, believed he was the last to see the deceased alive at about 3 p.m., but noticed nothing of significance.]</p>
<p>Dr Morgan:</p>
<p>Upon seeing the deceased he appeared to be dead. As a precaution applied a stomach pump and artificial respiration, but to no avail. The glass appeared to have held only a colourless liquid. If a poison, it could only have been acidulated alcohol. There was no sign or smell of a drug about the mouth. A post mortem revealed all organs were in good condition except the heart, which showed disease of long standing and the brain, which was extremely congested. The heart disease could have caused the congestion of the brain, which I believe was the cause of death. If a poison had been used only a salt of morphia would have caused congestion of the brain. While there is no evidence for such a poison in the bottles produced, I am unable to say whether the fatal congestion of the brain was caused by the heart condition or by poison.</p>
<p>Augustus Johnson said he was a close friend of the deceased and had known him to have suffered heart disease for some time.</p>
<p>Josiah Dennis, one of the Lodge auditors, explained some matters in connection with the cash defalcations of the deceased.</p>
<p>The Coroner is summing up remarked that there was no direct evidence that poison had been taken by the deceased and if the jury were of that opinion they would return a verdict of ‘Died by the visitation of God’. It was up to them to decide.</p>
<p>The Jury returned a verdict ‘That the deceased died from congestion of the brain, supposed to have been caused by the taking of poison.’</p>
<p>[William Henry Birbeck died 26 June 1862 at Kooringa aged 36. SA Births CD suggests that he left a widow, Elizabeth nee Wright and four surviving sons born between 1852 and 1860.]</p>

<p>‘Observer’ writes that on Sunday last the teams of the English and Australian Copper Company were to be seen passing and repassing through the town, openly violating the divine law and disregarding the disgrace to a Christian community. Being travellers they were also allowed to stop at public houses. If attention is not called to such evils there is no knowing how often it will be repeated. I do not know who is to blame in the matter, but I trust it will not be repeated.</p>

<p>New Line of Road Burra to Kadina</p>
<p>A meeting last Tuesday at the Travellers’ Rest Inn in Clare reported to the public on an expedition to Kadina. E.B. Gleeson JP was voted into the chair. He commented on the benefits of a direct line of toad from Burra via Clare to Wallaroo &amp; Kadina.</p>
<p>Mr Archer read his report.</p>
<p>The party was led by Messrs Hannaford, Gleeson, Ninnes and I. We left Clare on Monday morning 16 June and reached the Bung Bunga Gap at the south end of the salt lake the same evening, where we met the drays and men who were to do the heavy work needed to open up the new line of road. (This was 31 miles from Clare.)</p>
<p>The next morning from the top of the Hummocks the chimney at the Bay and the houses at Kadina were clearly visible. We started south along the top of a large hill lying about a mile west of the gap. We could see some small plains a short distance into the scrub to the southwest. We began knocking down the scrub, keeping in as near a straight line as possible. After about three hours we sighted the plains about a mile and a half away. We called them Wright’s Plains. We camped for the night in dense scrub, having made about 51⁄2 miles.</p>
<p>[He then describes the Wednesday work of getting on towards the west southwest to what they named Ninnes Plains. On Thursday they continued west for some 51⁄2 miles to some further small plains where they were delayed by having to send the bullocks back to the Hummocks for water. On Friday they cut a line nearly west for about three miles.]</p>
<p>On Saturday we continued to cut the line in the same direction for about 4 miles from Blight’s Plains. Then Mr Gleeson, having gone on ahead, discovered the plains east of Kadina were to our north. We altered course to the north for about 11⁄2 miles. When we emerged from the scrub we were about 171⁄2 miles from the top of Bung Bunga Gap and 51⁄2 miles from Kadina. We walked into Kadina and the drays came in on Sunday. On the following Tuesday we left for the head of the Kulpara Plains, from which we went north to cut the new line of road about 11⁄2 miles west of Blight’s Plains. We returned to Clare on 27 June.</p>
<p>[Archer then further explains the advantages of the new route with details about watering places and public houses near the line. Mr Hannaford then confirmed the superiority of the new road over the old line of travel. Mr Wright, who had accompanied the party, agreed with Archer and Hannaford.]</p>
<p>A discussion followed about what work would be needed to make the new route serviceable. Mr A. King then moved that the present committee decide what amount of clearing would be required and then call for tenders to achieve that. Dr Davies seconded. The motion was carried.</p>
<p>Mr Victorsen proposed that the committee begin communications with those likely to benefit from the new road, with a view to raising subscriptions and also petition the Government for a sum to be placed on the estimates to make the new road available. This was seconded by Mr Filgate and carried.</p>
<p>The Treasurer said there was already almost £60 in the subscription list from Clare.</p>

<p>Sheep on Farms</p>
<p>[An article describes the present position of wheat farmers who have met with a decreased market for their wheat in other Australian colonies. While no doubt markets will eventually be developed in England etc. in the meantime the incorporation of sheep on farms would provide another source of income. The article reports on the experience of J.H. Browne of Port Gawler in developing a breed of sheep suitable for this purpose, using Merino ewes and Lincoln, Cotswold and Romney Marsh rams. The ewes were drawn from Mr Browne’s Booborowie flock.]</p>

<p>A letter from Francis S. Dutton, Acting Commissioner for SA [London].</p>
<p>The magnificent display of SA minerals has excited great admiration, both as regards to the specimens from mines and from private collections, particularly those of Dr Maurau, Dr Englehardt and Mr Rollison. Considering how rare these specimens have become and how many years it has taken to accumulate them, it is a pity that our museum has not acquired them so that they might be sent back to Adelaide after the exhibition. I would respectfully submit that the committee consider acquiring them, especially as, much as they are admired, I doubt that their owners will be offered as much as the value they place upon them. The large specimen of malachite owned by Mr Crabb is greatly admired.</p>
<p>The reaping machine of Messrs Mellor &amp; Sons has also excited much attention. The malachite table contributed by J.B. Graham is superb. It was made from Burra malachite by Messrs Hall and sons, stonecutters. There is also a huge block of copper ore from the Cornwall Mine.</p>
<p>The photographic views have been neatly framed and glazed and we proposed to return them to the colony at the end of the exhibition unless we find purchasers at their full value or unless the committee directs otherwise.</p>
<p>[The letter continues with details of the SA Court at the exhibition and of some of the distinguished visitors to it; including the Prince of Prussia and the Duke of Newcastle.]</p>

<p>The Local Court sat yesterday and attracted considerable interest because on of the cases was to be tried by jury as allowed for under the amended Local Courts Act. It was an action for wages: Grey v. Tyler. The defendant failed to enter an appearance and after a lot of legal argument the case was referred to arbitration and the jury was not required.</p>
<p>In the next case Tovey sued Waite for breach of contract and wrongful dismissal. The verdict was for the plaintiff for the amount of services rendered, with each side to pay its own costs.</p>
<p>Following wet weather the roads are in a frightful state and the main street is one continuous ‘slough of despond’. Accidents are common. Yesterday Opie’s conveyance was just past the Mine Store when one wheel went into a hole and the other ran against a huge stone. The cart capsized, throwing the driver, J. Hockin, violently to the ground. Fortunately no bones were broken, though he was severely bruised.</p>
<p>This morning as the same conveyance was leaving for Kapunda with two or three passengers when the shaft horse lost its footing and fell. Mr Opie was precipitated into the quagmire and Mrs Mitchell only escaped the same fate by grasping the harness as she fell on top of the horse.</p>

<p>The outbreak of sickness in the community continues and the rate of mortality has scarcely declined. I am informed that in the last fortnight there have been upwards of 42 deaths. Last Sunday there were no fewer than six funerals. [If this is true, a great number of them were not registered. See figures cited at 9 August report. In fact fifteen deaths are registered for the period 20 August to 3 September. All were children; one aged 6, another aged 4 and the remainder were younger.</p>
<p>Burials on Sunday 31 August would almost certainly have meant deaths 29 to 31 August and for those days six deaths are recorded. Unfortunately there are no burials recorded for 30 August, but three of the four deaths registered for 30 August correspond with three burials that day. Emmline Bennett’s burial is not registered. James Henry Northy died and was buried on 29 August and Arthur Balfour Joseph Merritt died on 31 August, but no burial is recorded. While it is quite likely the cemetery registration record contains errors, it also seems unlikely that the claim for six funerals on Sunday is correct.]</p>

<p>Notice. SA Mining Association gives notice that the half-yearly meeting of shareholders will be held at the Association’s office in Rundle Street on Wednesday 15 October 1862 to receive the Directors’ Report, doe the examination of the Auditors’ Report and to elect a Director in place of J.C. Boord, Esq. who has resigned.</p>
<p>16 October 1862, page 2</p>
<p>The SA Mining Association: The Burra Burra Mines [Editorial]</p>
<p>The half-yearly meeting of the SA Mining Association took place in the offices of the company in Adelaide on Wednesday 15 October. The Directors reported that the ore raised in the past half year was 4,429 tons with an estimated 22% copper content. This had been taken from workings not below 55 fathoms; the workings having been limited to that depth for economic reasons. From 30 September 1861 to 31 March 1862 ore raised was 4,959 tons at a cost of £48,637-3-6 or £9-16-2 per ton. It realised £59,210-16-10 or £11-18-10 per ton, leaving a profit of £10,573-13-4 or £2-2-8. This is 5/3 per ton more than was realised in the previous half year, despite a fall in the price of copper. The total profit for the mine for the last half-year including rents and fees was £11,848-11-6. The credit balance in the company’s profit and loss account to 31 March 1862 is £11,598-13-3. To this may be added the estimated profit yet to be realised on ore raised in the past six months, which is £9,223-14-7, bringing the total balance of profit to £20,822-7-10 available for division among the shareholders. Directors intend to pay a dividend of £5 per share on 18 October, which will be the 50th dividend.</p>
<p>The reasons for suspending work below 55 fathoms have been cited as the low price of copper and the shortage of labour due to competition. This decision saved the cost of working one large pumping engine and of prosecuting much of the tutwork. Ore on hand at the mine on 30 September was 3,217 tons and there were also between 5 and 6 tons of refined copper on hand.</p>
<p>The Karkulto Mine is still being worked by tributers and is almost paying expenses.</p>

<p>A school was recently re-opened here and I am glad to say that the new master seems to give general satisfaction. He already has over 30 pupils on his books and there is good reson to expect he will soon have 40 if not more. The school is held in the Primitive Methodist Chapel, which is a neat and commodious room, capable of accommodating upwards of 60 students. The master is seriously inconvenienced by the lack of any nearby living accommodation. He has to live over three miles away and this has prevented his opening a night class for adults, which is much needed. Meetings to address this need have failed, for whatever reason, to gather support and it is feared that if nothing is done the school may again close.</p>
<p>Mrs Woodhead of Mintaro has taken over Mr Dorg’s Post-Office Store, which had been shut for a considerable period and this will supply a hard felt need, making the inconvenience and added expense of obtaining supplies from Kapunda or Burra unnecessary.</p>

<p>Accident. Today Mr Whitford, a hawker, has been brought in by Mr Edwards, the butcher, with a very badly broken shin bone. Apparently he was driving his cart on the road towards Crossroads when the reins slipped from his hand and the horse bolted. He jumped down in an attempt to catch the horses’ heads, but fell and fractured the bone just above the ankle. The bone punctured the skin and made an awful wound.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning at about 3 a.m. fire broke out in the Royal Oak Hotel, which being of highly combustible materials was in danger of being quickly totally consumed. Fortunately a number of men employed in repairing the road were lodged in a neighbouring building and after an hour’s hard work the hotel was saved. The fire was first seen by a daughter of the landlord Mr Hodges in the roof of a room adjoining her bedroom.</p>

<p>Despite the election being near at hand, nothing has been done here. Two requisitions have been despatched to former representatives and they have been accepted, but nothing else has occurred. Two public meeting have been called. No one attended the first and the second (on Tuesday) nothing much was done and the event turned into a burlesque.</p>
<p>This evening an attempt was made at the Burra Hotel to make preliminary arrangements for organising a volunteer corps. About 20 persons attended. Mr J.B. Anderson was voted into the chair. The Government had previous rejected such moves on account of the cost of sending up drill instructors etc. This no longer applies as there is in the town a person well qualified in drill instruction, having been engaged with several drill companies in the past. After some discussion Mr Burnell was unanimously elected secretary and drew up a draft of the memorial to be sent to the Government. It was signed by all present.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 5 November</p>
<p>There has been a sudden exodus of miners to the Newcastle coal mines. A gentleman from there has been here engaging miners for Newcastle and things are so unpromising here and the terms offered so tempting that I am informed that upwards of 100 miners have engaged to proceed to Newcastle. This has created a sensation in the town. Men everywhere are seen discussing the topic and others are engaged in selling off all they can spare ‘at enormous sacrifices’. A four-roomed house and contents were sold for £40. While some say it would be unwise to break up their homes to venture to Newcastle, others say that they cannot be worse off; for many here are not getting 30/- a week at the Burra Mines. What in undoubted is that their departure cannot but have an adverse effect on trade here, which will not be made up again for some time at least.</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held on Tuesday on the body of the deceased boy Pollard aged about 9. On Monday morning he went with one or two companions to the Mine and while there elected to have a bath in one of the small reservoirs connected with the pumping engines. His companions tried to dissuade him, but he undressed and jumped in. Being unable to swim, when the water proved to be beyond his depth, he sank and drowned before assistance could be obtained. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death from drowning.</p>
<p>[William Henry Pollard died 4 November 1862 at Kooringa aged 8; son of George Pollard.]</p>
<p>On Friday the adjourned volunteer meeting was resumed. The memorial to the Chief Secretary was adopted and signed by all present. I understand that about 40 signatures were obtained and that it has been despatched.</p>
<p>With respect to the election, the aforementioned apathy continues. So far it seems there is to be no opposition to the present candidates, Messrs Neales and Coles.</p>
<p>Large quantities of wool continue to pass through the township.</p>
<p>Tothill’s Creek News</p>
<p>In the past two weeks not only were all the mail conveyances and Opie’s busses crowded with miners from the Burra, but a large number of other drays and wagons were, and still are, conveying miners and their families and luggage to the Kapunda railway terminus, whence their passage is provided for to Newcastle. I hear that 200 men are already engaged and that engagements for 300 more are open. This wholesale departure of labouring men cannot be looked upon with much pleasure.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday night between 11 and 12 p.m. an unoccupied house belonging to Mt J.C. Barclay was discovered to be on fire. Amazingly the timber building was saved with only trifling damage. The house has been unoccupied for the last seven or eight weeks and was insured for £200. The inquest was delayed till Saturday to allow the representative of the insurance company to be present. The inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms, but little was determined as to the cause of the fire, although the jury decided that the fire was wilfully occasioned by person or persons unknown.</p>
<p>Numbers of people continue to prepare to depart for Newcastle and tradesmen here don’t know what will be the result of this extensive migration.</p>
<p>The election so far has not produced a single meeting here or an organisation of any kind. I have heard that Mr Neales intends to visit the town before nomination day, which is next Thursday. There is still no sign of any opposition.</p>

<p>Tothill’s Creek News</p>
<p>The teacher who some time ago was induced to re-open the school here has been unable to persuade the local parents to provide so much as a writing desk or a blackboard. Considering that there are 40 pupils and more expected after the harvest, it is hard to understand how parents can expect the teacher to bring on their children when they refuse to raise a few pounds for the most necessary articles of school furniture and materials. In other areas many hundreds of pounds have been raised to erect and furnish schools. Here there is a good building made available for nothing. The teacher has written and is circulating a final paper explaining his grievances. If this is greeted with indifference or contempt the peoples of Tothill’s Creek should not be surprised if the schoolmaster should seek a more rewarding field for his endeavours. It would be very difficult to attract another gentleman of respectability and learning if the school is abandoned for such reasons.</p>

<p>Kooringa Election Meeting</p>
<p>Mr W.H. Wilkinson was voted into the chair on Tuesday night at the Burra Hotel when Messrs Neales and Cole attended to give an account of their stewardship during the last Parliament, to outline their political opinions and to solicit support in the coming election.</p>
<p>Mr Cole said he had been instrumental in obtaining the vote for the Redruth Bridge and the survey of the Main North Road. He had also helped to get a sum of money for the construction of a road through the town, which ought to have been spent last year, but was still lying idle because the Central Road Board was not accepting contracts on the excuse of not competing with agriculture and others in the labour market. He said the district had not received justice in expenditure on roads because the Government had received upwards of £130,000 in revenue from it, not a tenth of that had been expended on roads.</p>
<p>He then spoke in favour of reintroducing ad valorem duties, in support of retaining the Central Road Board, against free distillation. He was opposed to attempts to give extra votes to property, which he said was already adequately represented in the Legislative Council. He would favour dividing the colony into four or five electorates for the Legislative Council in places of the single electorate at present. He was not in favour of further assistance to immigration at present. He would simplify the mineral regulations to help the original discoverers to benefit more fully. More of the education expenditure should be on country schools. He supported payment of members.</p>
<p>Mr Neales was greeted with a mixture of groans and cheers, but on the whole rather favourably.</p>
<p>Unlike Mr Cole, he favoured giving landowners more influence at elections. He would favour taxing absentee landowners, if they could show how it might be done. He had favoured the removal of ad valorem duties and would not now want them reintroduced, but he favoured taxation on luxuries – an in answer to questions about tobacco, would favour removing the duty on it. He did not favour bringing out migrants who would compete with present labour, but thought those seeking to bring out relatives should be assisted. He thought country education had a greater claim on the Government. He thought it a disgrace that a town like Kooringa should not have a single decent street. He also supported simpler mineral regulations to assist original discoverers. He would not support payment of members.</p>
<p>Proposals that both gentlemen were fit and proper persons to represent the district were passed.</p>

<p>The migration to Newcastle continues and numbers of families are still preparing to depart. The Mining Company has pulled down a row of tenements previously occupied by miners and there are a great many unoccupied houses in various parts of the town.</p>
<p>Collections have been made on behalf of the Lancashire Relief Fund in the Wesleyan Chapel and the result is about £18, which it is intended to make up to £20 before remitting it to the Adelaide Committee.</p>

<p>Mr Winship and the Burra Miners</p>
<p>A short time ago Mr J.B. Winship of the Australian Agricultural and Coal Company in NSW came to SA for the purpose of securing miners to work in the company’s Newcastle coal mines. He was very successful. He went to Burra and secured 100 miners and their families, whom he took back with him on his return to Newcastle. In addition he either engaged or made such representations to two to three hundred more that made them believe they were justified in quitting their work and selling up preparatory to moving to Newcastle. Many did so and are now waiting in Adelaide, reduced almost to beggary. A letter just received from Mr Winship puts and end to all their hopes:</p>

<p>Newcastle Nov. 21, 1862</p>
<p>‘Dear Sir – I wish you would write to Thomas Chaple at Kooringa, saying that for the present you cannot give passages to any more men who may be desirous until you get further instructions from this end. And please tell them you can on no account can you give them a passage unless they pay for it, and then, of course, you have no alternative.</p>
<p>‘Our coal trade is very slack and we cannot take any more men just now.</p>
<p>‘Yours Faithfully,</p>
<p>Jas. B. Winship.</p>
<p>‘Messrs G. Bartleet and Co.</p>
<p>Merchants, Adelaide.’</p>
<p>In the absence of Mr Winship’s explanation we cannot tell the extent of his responsibility for the misery brought upon so many. But it is clear from the letter sent that there must have been some understanding with the man left behind or instructions would not have been sent to stop the exodus. The sooner he seeks to exculpate himself from the charge preferred against him of violating his engagement with the miners the better. We hope he will not be slow to make compensation for the injuries he has inflicted, if the statements made to us be correct.</p>
<p>It is said that the men who have already taken employment under Mr Winship are dissatisfied with their bargain and have written to their friends recommending that they should not leave their employment here.</p>

<p>The AGM in connection with the Foreign Australasian Wesleyan Missionary Society was held on Wednesday evening 3 December in the Emu Vale Chapel at Black Springs. The attendance was good and the collections were encouraging.</p>
<p>The weather in the past week has been very hot and bush fires have been raging. One on Mr Dutton’s property consumed a garden, outhouse and a large amount of feed before being extinguished by Mr S. Porter JP and others. The other destroyed a quantity of timber and feed. Both seem to have been the result of negligence.</p>
<p>On Monday morning a severe storm brought thunder, lightning, rain and hail. The lightning and wind destroyed the verandah of the Emu Hotel at Black Springs.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 10 December</p>
<p>The censure of Mr Winship in yesterday’s editorial created a sensation here and the consensus was that it was well merited. It is true that the distress you alluded to is all too real. Many men have been induced to throw up their employment and having disposed of their possessions at great sacrifice have left here almost penniless in the expectation of a free passage to Newcastle and the assurance of employment upon arrival. Now the bubble has burst and they find themselves destitute, without either home or employment. Others have not left yet, but have given up their employment and sold their possessions. They are doubtful of regaining their jobs, but if they do are still confronted with the need to refurnish their homes at great expense. While not wishing to shield Mr Winship from legitimate blame, but it is a fact that he desired the men not to act rashly or precipitately and he did send a telegram to one of their number stating that he no longer required then and asking them to remain where they were. This was disregarded and dismissed as a concoction of the telegraph clerk at the instigation of the Burra Directors. There have thus been faults on both sides. Mr Winship was certainly at fault in offering so much in the first place and the miners at fault in acting without more discretion.</p>
<p>Rev. T. Lloyd delivered a lecture last Friday in the Wesleyan Schoolroom on Grant Thorben; an example of perseverance and diligence. Attendance was quite good considering the hot and sultry weather.</p>
<p>Rev. M. Wilson preached special sermons on Sunday on behalf of Wesleyan Missions and promoted the same cause at a public meeting on Monday and to young people on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On one of Mr Tyler’s northern stations recently a flood swept away the huts and total possessions of two men named Moore and Brooks who were living there with their wives. They all had a very narrow escape and are now penniless. I understand Rev. Hancock is endeavouring to obtain relief for them and will gladly receive contributions on their behalf.</p>
<p>Shearing is now over and wool carting is rapidly proceeding. I believe the clip has been a tolerable one in this district.</p>

<p>Mining Swindle [Editorial]</p>
<p>Some extracts from the London Mining Journal and an advertisement in the Times make reference to a pretended New Burra Burra Mine in this colony, which discloses one of the most nefarious transactions that has come to our notice for some time. The location is not stated, but the report says there are rich bodies of proven ore a mile and a half long and 50 yards wide. The advertisement in the Times is quite extraordinary and compares the supposed new find unfavourably with the Burra Burra Mine and in an attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the reader draws or suggests links between the two.</p>
<p>The whole thing appears to have its origin in a real discovery of Messrs Warren and Francis of Gawler and Mr Cave, formerly in the employ of Messrs Chambers and Co. They discovered three mineral sections, Nos 1381, 1370 and 1544 some 200 miles north of Port Augusta, which they believe to be potentially valuable. Mr Cave sent instructions to England for the sale of the property. We are assured the property was properly represented and named using the native designation Yappoo.</p>
<p>It was to be sold as a bona fide mine with a view to the development of its treasures. It seems however that it fell into the hands of improper parties who saw the possibilities for unjust and dishonourable speculation. Alleged specimens were sent for analysis and the name was changed. The most exaggerated descriptions were given of the property. A company was started with 2,000 shares of £5 each and 1,600 were reserved for the proprietors, with 400 offered to the public. The shrewd operators then appropriated the 1,600 shared reserved for the original discoverers. We are assured that the London operators had not the slightest authority for any of these arrangements. We can of course incur no responsibility for the explanations which have been given to us. We simply state the facts as related to us. We have reason to believe that the original proprietors are respectable gentlemen and believe they cannot in justice to themselves allow the matter to remain where it is.</p>
<p>Arrival of Mr Stuart at Kooringa</p>
<p>Kooringa 16 December 1862</p>
<p>Stuart has arrived at Kooringa and was enthusiastically greeted by a large crowd at the Post Office. An address was presented to him. Mr Stuart repeats that the route is quite practicable for stock. The grass on the banks of the creeks and rivers which he saw was quite dry, proving that the floods would not have risen from recent rains, but that the water was permanent. He had little or no rain during the trip, but was only one or two nights without water. The part of the coast which he reached seemed to abound in harbours.</p>
<p>Telegram: Mr J. Chambers to Mr Finke</p>
<p>Kooringa, December 16, 6.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Stuart, Auld and self home by last train to-morrow. Have reached the coast. Party all well.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 17 December</p>
<p>The explorer Stuart, accompanied by Mr Auld, one of his party, Captain McKay of Mt Deception and Mr John Chambers, arrived at Kooringa last evening by the Mt Remarkable mail. They were enthusiastically received by a large crowd at the Post Office. Mr Stuart appeared in a very low state; as well he might, having suffered from scurvy for much of the trip. On reaching the Post Office he alighted with difficulty and on being brought to the front, Mr W.H. Wilkinson read the following address, which had been hastily prepared for the occasion:</p>
<p>‘To John McDouall Stuart, Esq.</p>
<p>Sir, - Hearing of the probability of your passing through our township this evening, we the undersigned have hurriedly assembled to congratulate you, on behalf of the inhabitants of Kooringa, upon your safe return from your explorations in the interior of this vast continent; and also to assure you that we, in common with the rest of our fellow-colonists, fully appreciate the valuable services which you have rendered the public in revealing the condition and resources of that portion of our land hitherto unknown. We regret that lack of opportunity prevents our making a more suitable and worthy acknowledgement of our obligations to you, but we are convinced that the satisfaction which you must feel in having faithfully done your duty will in itself be no small reward.</p>
<p>‘We again congratulate you on the successful termination of your arduous enterprise, and tender you a most hearty and unanimous welcome on your safe return.</p>
<p>We, are, &amp;c.’</p>
<p>(Here follow the signatures of W.H. Wilkinson, W.L.H. Bruse, J. Burnell, W. Young and others.)</p>
<p>Mr Stuart then briefly replied somewhat as follows:</p>
<p>‘Gentlemen – You will not expect me to say much in my present circumstances; but I heartily thank you for the honour you have bestowed upon me. As I have not yet officially reported myself to the Government, I cannot enter into any details of the results of my trip, but I may say that I have accomplished all and more than the Government expected of me. I have exceeded my most sanguine expectations; and when my journal is published you will be surprised.’</p>
<p>Cheers were given and the bus moved off and the assembly dispersed.</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. On Monday an inquest was held at Lowe’s Inn on the body of a man who had been employed at McCulloch’s station, but who accidentally fell into a well and was drowned.</p>

<p>The Newcastle mania has entirely subsided. All are going on in the old track. Two of the emigrants have returned and give very unflattering reports of the affairs at Newcastle. Had those who acted precipitately waited prudently for more information they would have saved themselves much trouble and loss.</p>
<p>Operations at the Bon Accord Mine have definitely stopped. They have not been suspended, but as a Cousin Jack would say are ‘nacked’.</p>
<p>Mr Stuart’s Expedition</p>
<p>The following telegram was posted at the Exchange on Wednesday: -</p>
<p>‘John McDouall Stuart, commander of the South Australian Great Northern Exploring Expedition to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.</p>
<p>Kooringa, December 16, 1862.</p>
<p>‘Through you, I beg to inform His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief and the Government that I have accomplished the object of the expedition.</p>
<p>‘ Party all well.</p>
<p>‘I will be in town by the evening train to-morrow.’</p>
<p>Black Springs News, 16 December</p>
<p>Many of the inhabitants here were much surprised and alarmed by an earthquake here on the morning of 15 December. Some felt an oscillation of the earth from west to north, some a return shock from north to west. Those who were up described feeling a wave-like sensation, while those still in bed described a trembling motion. The shaking of household goods was accompanied by a rumbling sound. The effect seems to have been quite localised as it was not reported from 13 miles away.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 18 December</p>
<p>This morning arrangements were made to present another address to Mr Stuart on his departure by the Adelaide mail and for escorting him for some distance along the road. Mr McDermott SM, Dr Mayne JP and Mr J.R. Anderson JP escorted Mr Stuart from his room at the Burra Hotel to the mail cart when it drew up about half past eight. The address was read by Mr McDermott and Mr Stuart acknowledged the honour. He was looking better than on the previous evening as he was helped into the bus.</p>
<p>Nine cartfuls of people and others on horseback accompanied Stuart about three miles down the Adelaide Road, giving him three hearty old English cheers before returning to Kooringa.</p>
<p>The address:</p>
<p>‘To John McDouall Stuart Esq.</p>
<p>Sir – The inhabitants of the Burra beg me, before you leave this for Adelaide, to assure you that they rejoice at your safe return from your eminently successful though perilous journey, and they feel proud of the honour and privilege of being able to call you fellow-colonist, after having accomplished what your indomitable pluck and perseverance alone could achieve.</p>
<p>‘They sincerely regret that your health has so severely suffered from the privations and exposure to which you have been subjected and which are inseparable from the life of an explorer; but trust that the comforts of a civilised home, to which you are now returning, will soon restore you to your former health.</p>
<p>They trust you may long live to enjoy the laurels which you have so nobly won, with so much credit to yourself and such material advantage to the colony, and which they feel sure will be duly appreciated by the public and the Legislature. They heartily bid you welcome back to South Australia.</p>

<p>James B. Winship writes from Newcastle, NSW, 16 December.</p>
<p>I am sorry to find that a number of people have left Kooringa for Adelaide with intention of coming to Newcastle to work for us. ‘When I left Kooringa I told the men there that I could not say how many men we could take, but as soon as I reached Newcastle I would immediately write to Thos. Chaple who would give them all necessary information. On the 21st November – the very day I reached here – I wrote to Chaple, saying that the coal trade was very dull and that I could take no more men at present, and that he was to inform the people as soon as possible.’</p>
<p>‘On the 29th November I sent Thos. Chaple the following telegram – “I cannot take one man at present. The coal trade is dull. Waiting.”’</p>
<p>On 4 December I sent a similar telegram and again on 7 December: ‘Do not send one man to Adelaide. The Steam Company have distinct orders not to bring one single man.’</p>
<p>I gave people passage tickets to secure a passage to Newcastle, but they were to come when sent for. No one was to come until I sent for him.</p>
<p>‘I have no doubt all the blame has been put on my head, and many hard things said, as being a deceiver, &amp;c.; but I am sure I had no desire to deceive or lead any one astray, or attempt to deceive those with whom I had any conversation relative to Newcastle.’</p>
<p>‘The Cornish men do not like coal-getting at all, and they are quite disappointed. They thought getting coal was similar to copper-getting. Several of them brought by me have absconded already, while others have paid their passage according to their agreement.’</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 1 January</p>
<p>During the past year progress here has not been the equal of many other parts of the colony. The extra stimulus supplied by agricultural and commercial pursuits is wanting here. Mining is the single pursuit around which all interests revolve. And that is controlled by the successes or reverses of a single mine. Even though that mine is the great Burra Burra Mine and fall in copper prices or the production of that mine has an immediate affect on the whole social machine. In the past year the Burra Mine has found it expedient to reduce employment and as a consequence many people have left the district. Despite all this we are very nearly as prosperous as any other part of the colony.</p>
<p>Christmas Day was observed as a holiday, at least as far as closure of businesses was concerned, but in other respects it was more like a Sunday than a holiday. The streets were deserted and people mostly enjoyed themselves in their own homes. The following day (Friday) had more of the appearance of a holiday. Many took advantage of the good weather for picnics and similar parties. Many with less refined tastes, including many young men and lads, lounged around the taverns, playing skittles and wrestling. The Primitive Methodists had a pleasant tea and public meeting.</p>
<p>The weather yesterday was dominated by a hot wind and much dust, though a cool breeze from the west arrived in the evening.</p>

<p>The two-hour lecture exhausted the speaker, but not the subject. He discussed the strata of rocks. The origin and gradation of animal and vegetable life, the structure of the earth and the processes which had been at work on it. He believed the heat providing the energy for many of these processes came not from within, but from electricity. He dwelt upon the great age of the earth and reconciled this hypothesis with the Mosaic record. He also spoke of the various monstrosities that had dwelt upon the earth prior to the advent of the human species.</p>

<p>Black Springs News, 6 March</p>
<p>Yesterday a most fearful storm arose from the east at about 4 p.m. The rain and hail were most ferocious and the hail of great size. The creeks were soon in flood</p>
<p>Obituary. At the height of the severe thunder storm James Waite, a sheep farmer at Pandappa, was drowned at Black Springs in attempting to cross a swollen creek on horseback. He was seen riding down the Adelaide Road past the chapel, but disappeared when trying to cross the creek on a stone bridge recently erected over it. Shortly afterwards his riderless horse was seen galloping across an adjacent section. A young man caught the animal and rode to the Emu Hotel where he gave the alarm. Police Trooper Kidney from the Burra was there and immediately started a search. He found the body about 450 yards down the creek. On taking out the gentleman’s watch he found the deceased was James Waite of the firm of Waite Brothers of Pandappa, sheep farmers. He was also recognised by one of his hands, which had been previously injured. The body was taken to the Emu Hotel to await an inquest. When the waters fell it was seen that the centre of the bridge had been entirely washed away. [This death does not appear on SA Deaths CD, but BISA information suggests that James Deas Waite of Pandappa was born c. 1829 and died 5 March 1863.]</p>
<p>10 March 1863, page 3</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. On Friday a coroner’s inquest was held at the Aberdeen Hotel before Dr Mayne JP to enquire into the death of James Waite, sheep farmer. Captain Killicoat was the foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Henry Chandler, publican of Black Springs, said he saw the deceased alive the previous day at about 4 p.m. He had seen him on the Light River as he was heading to Black Springs. He had asked if he stayed at the Emu Hotel overnight he could reach Burra by 8 o’clock the next morning. I said he could. It was not raining at that time, when we were eight miles from my home. The ford near my home was not fit for crossing and that afternoon a great quantity of water was coming down the creek.</p>
<p>James Tyler, labourer of Black Springs.</p>
<p>Saw deceased at about 5 p.m. when he was some 200 yards from the ford. Went into Robinson’s house for 15 minutes and on coming out saw a saddled horse in the paddock on the opposite side of the creek. Went to the schoolhouse to see if the rider was sheltering there, but finding no one I rode the horse to the hotel and asked if anyone was there who had lost a horse. Police Trooper Kidney, myself and one or two others then went to seek the rider. We found the body about 450 yards down the creek. It had not been raining when I saw the deceased, but there was a flood in the creek, which would have been 10-12 ft deep in places. The ford was in good repair before the flood, but is now completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Henry Kidney, Police Trooper.</p>
<p>[Kidney’s evidence corroborates Tyler and he goes on to say how they identified the deceased from the belongings found on or near the body. George Allen, commercial traveller, gave evidence concerning the ford and his view was that it was not completed before the flood, but was merely loose stones.]</p>
<p>The jury found that the deceased had accidentally drowned through the bad state of the road.</p>
<p>[Note that the ‘bridge’ in the report of 7 March is consistently described as a ford at the inquest.]</p>

<p>Education Report.</p>
<p>[There is quite a lengthy article on the report of the Board of Education for 1862. For the colony it shows that schools increased by 8 and the number of scholars by 706. This meant that schools were increasing at a rate of 31⁄2% and student numbers at 61⁄2%. One school closed at Redruth. The average stipend of teachers in municipal towns was £46-19-6 and in country districts £51-11-4, compared with £50-2-71⁄4 for 1861. The average amount of school fees received by teachers in municipal towns was £75-10-6 and in country districts was £45-15-0. The apparent increase in the latter item over 1861, which was then £40-18-11, arose chiefly from the townships of Kooringa and Kapunda, which came under a new classification included in the country districts.]</p>

<p>Loyal Burra Lodge MUIOOF celebrated its anniversary on Tuesday. At about 3 p.m. some 50 officers and brethren started at the Burra Hotel and walked to Redruth with banners flying before returning to St Mary’s church where they were addressed by Rev. Canon Fulford. A dinner was then provided by host Kent at the Burra Hotel. E. Chapman took the chair.</p>
<p>[The usual toasts are then listed; those mentioned as involved included: Rev. J. Fulford, PG Wells, PG W. Pearce, Mr Oldham (of Allendale), NG Peattie, Bro. Turner (of Mintaro), Bro. Henwood and Bro. Gubbins (of Mintaro).]</p>
<p>The lodge was founded eight years ago with but eight members and now there were 277 and the total worth of the Lodge was about £2,131.</p>
<p>About 18 vehicles and a number of horsemen followed the body of the late James Waite to the cemetery last Sunday.</p>
<p>I understand tenders have actually been called for repairs to our street, though the specifications suggest the job will be only half done. The Board intends to start the work at the Burra Hotel and go as far as just beyond the creek opposite the Catholic Chapel, where it will stop, short of some 400 yards of the worst road in the whole township. It commences again at Parks’ store, where the natural road is firm and dry, and then goes over the side of the hill past the Telegraph Office to Redruth. It is a pity the Government persist in bungling such matters.</p>
<p>‘Here is a piece of road in the very centre of the main street, and which in winter is one yawning slough, left untouched by the Road Board, who, following the maxim of showing “how not to do it,” seem careful to bestow money and labour where least requires, while those places which seem actually begging for aid are entirely forsaken.’</p>

<p>Bench of Magistrates, Monday 21 March</p>
<p>[Applications for publicans licences. Among a long list for locations across the colony were the following.]</p>
<p>Charles William Cowper for the Pig and Whistle, Kooringa.</p>
<p>The police that the stable complained of had been repaired. Granted.</p>
<p>John Dunstan for the Bushman’s Home, Redruth.</p>
<p>The police report was unfavourable, saying the house was too small for an inn.</p>
<p>H. Mildred and Mr Parker promised, on behalf of the applicant, that the house would be improved. The Bench felt that it would have been better if the improvements had preceded the application. Dunstan said he had just taken over the lease from Mr Opie and it had about a year to run. He had cleared out a foundation and laid stone to built additional bedrooms. Heretofore he had accommodated all comers with beds on sofas without complaint. The stable and stockyard had been rebuilt. He expected the bedrooms to be finished in about two to three weeks. Mr Mildred read memorials supporting the applicant. Mr Bonney said the hotels at Kooringa were all abominable and no licence ought to be granted unless there was proper accommodation available.</p>
<p>Application refused with the right to re-apply next quarter.</p>
<p>William Oliver for the Commercial Hotel, Copperhouse.</p>
<p>A second report by the police was against the character of the applicant and the conduct of the house. It stated that the applicant was of intemperate habits and the house was not kept in a clean condition. Mr Parker said the house was frequented by sheep drovers and there was ample space in the paddocks for sheep and sufficient accommodation for the drovers. He read a memorial in favour of the application and said it was intended to let the house as soon as possible and that Mrs Oliver was fully competent to run it in the meantime.</p>
<p>Refused.</p>
<p>[One application for a hotel at Mintaro is granted and another refused. Details are given; James Torr for the Devonshire Hotel and John Smith for the Mintaro Hotel, respectively.]</p>
<p>27 March 1863, page 2</p>
<p>John Kent, landlord of the Burra Hotel writes re the comment by Mr Bonney on the Bench of Magistrates that all Kooringa hotels were abominable.</p>
<p>‘&hellip;the accommodation in my house had for many years been considered good and sufficient, perhaps Mr Bonney will, through the medium of your valuable journal, inform me in what particular my house lacks the accommodation usually found in country hotels.’</p>

Unfortunately our steam flour mill has broken some of its machinery and will be idle for a short time. The owner of it is also owner of a public house, which has been refused a licence for three months. Fortunately Host Torr of the Devonshire Arms has had his licence granted.</p>

<p>The work repairing the main road through the town has commenced and will need to be accomplished rapidly to be completed before winter sets in. I am given to understand that the whole road will now be repaired, without the hiatus I have recently complained of.

<p>Obituary. Last Thursday a two-year-old girl died here suddenly just as her mother, who had been left with two children to support, was on the point of going to Kooringa to seek aid for her from Dr Mayne. She was interred at Apoinga about 61⁄2 miles away after a service by a Wesleyan local preacher. There is no closer burial ground, though Messrs Duffield and Porter have offered to give an acre of land for the purpose if the settlers will pay for the transfer. Just as the funeral was about to start Mr Porter came up and said they might have used the new ground as it was all but conveyed to the trustees.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association: The Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]</p>
<p>The 18th Annual Report was submitted to shareholders and adopted on 15 April. The report is as gratifying as usual. In the past half-year the ore raised amounted to 4,302 tons, estimated to contain 23% fine copper. This is almost the same tonnage as the previous six months, but the percentage of copper is higher. In the last six months the price of copper has risen. Last November the price in Adelaide advanced from £87-10-0 to £91 per ton, at which rate the bulk of the copper raised during the six months was disposed of. The Association has not made any shipments themselves during the half-year. The report says the present price is £91 per ton, but since it was written the arrival of the English mails reports that it has fallen to £88.</p>
<p>In the half-year to 30 September 1862 the profit per ton sold was £1-7-8 in excess of the profit on the previous half-year, although the rise in price to £91 did not take place till November 1862. Some of this improvement is due to decreased costs in producing the ore. But even now it is shown that for the half-year for which the accounts are closed the ore raised, which cost the Association £9-8-5 per ton, sold for £12-18-9 per ton, against £11-18-10 per ton during the previous half-year when the cost of production was £9-16-2 per ton. Hence the increased profit arises partly from reduced costs and partly from a better price. In the six months to 30 September 1862 the ore raised was 4,631 tons at a cost of £43,638-17-9 and the nett proceeds on the sale of this ore was £59,917-11-5, leaving a profit of £16,278-13-8. In addition rents produced £1,059-9-3 and fees £4-15-0 to give total half year profits of £17,342-17-11. This sum went towards the payments of the two dividends of £12,320 each, which were declared in October and February last and there is now a balance of profit amounting to £4,301-11-2 besides produce undisposed of, which it is expected will realise £7,353-2-7, making together a balance of £11,654-13-9.</p>
<p>The report of the Mining Captain speaks in high terms of the mew pitches which have been opened in Peacock’s Main and Air Shafts and refers in an encouraging way to other workings. In fact in all parts of the mine the reports are of a monotonous song of success. Everything is in good working order and there are 88 pitches at work and ore raised in the last take of eight week was 1,350 tons.</p>
<p>At Karkulto Mine there are seven miners working on tribute at the 20 and 25 fathom levels. The lode is three feet wide and is composed of more iron ore than copper.</p>
<p>Employees at 31 March 1863 numbered 635.</p>

<p>Central Road Board</p>
<p>A communication was received outlining the Surveyor-General’s report on a matter raised by Mr Cole MP.</p>
<p>‘There is a portion of the main line of road from the west boundary of the Burra Special Survey remaining undefined, and as the Burra proprietors repudiated the power of the Government to reserve roads through their lands, and destroyed the survey-marks made by the department upon the ground, it is only reasonable to suppose that legal access may at any time be cut off from the confirmed portion of road within the block, and that consequently it is only prudent to delay works until the whole of the line through the blocks has been properly defined.’</p>
<p>It appears that the work described in Mr Coles’ motion is now being carried out, but the Board referred the matter to Mr Macaulay.</p>

<p>On Sunday 3 May the new public schoolroom was opened and a branch of the Burra Baptist Congregational Church was also opened. Three sermons were preached by Rev. E. Newlyn to attentive and numerous congregations. On Monday 4 May a public tea meeting was held in the new schoolroom and four sittings were needed. The children of the day school enjoyed tea and cakes and afterwards scrambled for nuts and lollies. After tea a public service was held and a collection made. It was found that this met the expenses in erecting the building and left a balance in hand.</p>

<p>On Monday a public meeting was held in the Wesleyan Chapel for the purpose of raising funds for the Aboriginal Friends’ Society. Mr MacDermott took the chair and Rev. J. Hancock moved a resolution that the meeting acknowledged its Christian duty to support the welfare of the Aborigines. He gave an address in support and the motion was seconded by W.H. Wilkinson. The latter observed that despite denials by some persons ‘he thought it had been proved beyond doubt that the poor natives really had souls, and more, that they were susceptible of religious impressions.’ The motion was carried.</p>
<p>Rev. H. Cole then moved a motion applauding the success of the Society, thanking God for His aid therein and proposing a local branch be formed. In speaking in support he recounted his experiences at Strathalbyn and Point McLeay. Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson seconded the motion in an interesting, forcible and somewhat lengthy speech. He said the Secretary of the Society would have accompanied him had not circumstances prevented it. He outlined the work of the Society. The motion was carried and a collection yielded £9. The local branch was then formed and a committee established.</p>
<p>The road-making continues apace, but there are a number of objections arising as well. The main complaint is that the bridge will be admirably suited for blocking the flow of water that rushes down the creek after heavy rain and a well-constructed ford would have served the road needs adequately and allowed the stream a freer course. The road is but 18 feet wide and there is a high bank on one side and a yawning morass on the other. Picture what will happen when a dozen mule wagons or bullock drays are dragging their mass down the centre of this and they meet other would be users of the street. Then again instead of going close to the Bank, Institute or Telegraph-Office, where little excavation would have been needed, the road goes along the side of the hill, necessitating much quarrying and blasting.</p>
<p>The sheep farmers are much in want of rain and if it does not come soon the lambing season will be an unprofitable one.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. A young man named Woods was a bullock driver carting firewood from the Murray Scrub. On Friday morning in the company of a lad named Williams he was riding in the scrub seeking their bullocks when Woods’ mare fell and brought down both horses. Williams was soon up, but he found Woods had fractured the base of his skull. Williams went for aid and soon found a man called Sampson. They returned and found Woods still alive, but insensible. After some delay they obtained a bullock cart and took the deceased to Mr Barker’s property of Baldino [sic: for Baldina]. They did not get there till nearly 9 p.m. and Woods had expired about an hour earlier. It is unlikely that medical aid would in any case have been of any avail.</p>
<p>An inquest was held by Dr Mayne on Saturday, which returned a verdict of accidental death. Woods was the support for his aged parents and sisters.</p>

<p>Today is a red-letter day in Cousin John’s calendar and the holiday was announced with a salvo from logs of wood and hundredweights plugged with blasting powder. In the evening juveniles lit numerous bonfires. Though the smell is hardly that of roses, this does have a good sanitary effect of removing a large quantity of filth and rubbish. Shops were closed. This year the day included the celebrations opening our new bridge and line of new road, which is almost completed. About 3 p.m. a procession was headed by Rounsevell’s mail omnibus drawn by five horses and containing the contractor, Mr Haines, and an extempore band of musicians. Mr Dawson’s mail conveyance with four horses followed, loaded with various citizens and this was followed by several cartloads of people. The procession started at Drew’s corner and proceeded to Aberdeen and Redruth and on returning came along the new road, crossed the bridge and proceeded to the Burra Hotel before wheeling around and returning to the bridge where it halted. Mr S. Drew alighted and led his daughter Louisa aged about 8. She smashed a bottle of wine over the bridge in the orthodox fashion and named the structure ‘The Kooringa Bridge’. Mr Nicholls, superintendent of the works then declared the bridge and road open for traffic. Cheers followed and young folk scrambled for coins thrown from the various vehicles.</p>
<p>This road and bridge are a considerable improvement for the town and any deficiencies are not the fault of the contractor, who has fulfilled faithfully every tittle of his agreement.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. George Ferguson, whose place of residence seems to have been Kooringa, although recently he had been staying in Adelaide, was arrested on 14 July on a charge of obtaining money under false pretences. This was later changed to one of forgery. He was an alcoholic and after being taken to the Station appeared to suffer from weak convulsions, which were attributed to his intemperate habits. Shortly after 11 o’clock his condition deteriorated and he was taken from his cell and placed before the fire in the reserve room. He first seemed to improve, but at about midnight gradually became weaker and died at about 12.15 a.m. A paper found on the deceased when first arrested was addressed to a person in Kooringa imploring him to take pity on the writer’s wife and children. Dr Moore conducted a post mortem and concluded that the deceased died from apoplexy; with which the jury at the inquest concurred.</p>
<p>[Registered as George Ferguson died 16 July 1863 Adelaide, residence Burra. Birth registrations suggest his wife was Julia nee Bolster and the children were George born at Kooringa 13 February 1861 (and died there 20 June 1864) and Julia born 12 June 1862. None are readily traceable beyond this.]</p>

<p>[The only death registered in this period was that of Patrick O’Connor 9 July 1863 near Mintaro aged 28, but the death may not have been registered as the correspondent also reports that they were without an agent or deputy registrar of births, marriages and deaths and the nearest was ten miles away over very bad roads.]</p>

<p>The annual meeting of the Burra branch of the SA Bible Society was held in St Mary’s Schoolroom on 21 September. The place was well filled and Mr T.S. Porter occupied the chair, flanked by the town’s various ministers of religion. Rev. H. Chester read the report, which showed that since the branch was established more than 4,000 Bibles had been issued. The income in the past year had increased and allowed £100 to be sent to the parent body. After the report and address by the deputation from Adelaide a collection raised £5-13-0. The office bearers were all re-elected.</p>

<p>The Copper Market. A report from Liverpool dated 25 August cites Burra Burra and Kapunda copper at £99-£100 per ton. The recent low prices for copper have resulted in reduced production from mines around the world and some have closed; the prices obtained not meeting the costs of production. Inevitably supplies will be limited for some time and that makes prospects for the article favourable.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association: the Burra Burra Mine [Editorial]</p>
<p>The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held at its Adelaide office on 21 October. The report suggests that operations have been very encouraging. In the six months the ore raised was 4,348 tons, which is slightly up on the previous six months, despite adverse weather conditions. It averaged 23% copper. In the six months to 31 March 1863 the total raised had been 4,205 tons. The cost of production was £44,349-2-8 or £10-10-11 per ton. The ore realised £51,936-6-5 or £12-7-0 per ton. This left a profit of £7,587-3-9 or £1-16-1 per ton. The entire profit for the half-year, including that from other sources, amounted to £8,393-6-3. The estimated balance divisible amongst shareholders after the realisation of the last half-year’s produce in £14,225-14-7.</p>

<p>H.E. the Governor arrived in Kooringa on Tuesday 8 December accompanied by the Hon. H. Ayers, Mr A. Blyth MP, Mr J. Beck and others. They were enthusiastically received along the road by a large procession of gentlemen on horseback and in vehicles. On reaching the Burra Hotel Mr Ayers apologises for the Governor not addressing the townspeople that day and appointed the next day at 4 p.m. in Market Square for the purpose.</p>
<p>On Wednesday 9 December the Governor visited the smelting works and saw the operation of making copper. Afterwards he visited the Mine and saw the extensive workings belonging to it. He then inspected the Post Office and the Institute, before meeting the citizens in Market Square. Two addresses were there presented to him by Mr MacDermott SM; one from the English inhabitants and the other from the German residents. H.E. made a suitable reply and also sought to quash a rumour that he had said at Wallaroo that 3/6 a day was enough for miners’ wages. Its likely source, he believed, was a statement he made regarding the price of water; that 3/6 per barrel was quite enough instead of 6/-. The explanation elicited enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>There was quite a lot of bunting on display for the visit and attempts at arches.</p>

<p>Redruth Court, 23 December before Messrs M. MacDermott SM &amp; W.H. Challoner JP.</p>
<p>Aaron Cole was charged with stealing three sheep, the property of John &amp; Alfred Hallett.</p>
<p>The prosecution said it wished to bring new charges that Cole and a servant in his employ, named Gleeson, had jointly stolen sheep from the prosecutors. After some legal discussion the case proceeded with the new charges. Michael Hogan gave evidence of finding incriminating skins at the premises of Messrs Tiver &amp; Cole, having received information from a man named Netherey. Richard Hallett, manager for the prosecutors, identified skins, which he said were from a flock kept by a shepherd named Siegar. George Feigart was called and identified the skins. [Is this the shepherd previously referred to as Siegar?] Netherey also gave evidence of the killing of Hallett’s sheep by Cole and Gleeson. Counsel submitted that Netherey’s evidence could not be admitted without corroboration because Netherey was an accomplice, having taken part in the skinning.</p>
<p>James Tiver, Cole’s partner, gave evidence that all the sheep consumed at shearing time had come from their own flock. He said Netherey had been dismissed for cutting the brand off Hallett’s sheep and also outlined failed arrangements to discuss the matter with R. Hallett. Evidence was given by James Tiver Jnr and John Smith about sheep killed at shearing and Smith said he had known Netherey for five years and would not believe him under oath. Emma Tiver, wife of Mr Tiver gave evidence of Netherey’s bad feelings towards Cole. Evidence of Cole’s good character was given by William Godson, George Hiles, David Mackey, William Willicoat [Woollacott?] and W.H. Forder (Clerk of the Court). Godson and Willicoat gave evidence of Netherey’s bad character. After deliberation the Bench decided that although the case for the prosecution rested on the evidence of a man who seemed to bear a bad character and the accused had hitherto borne an excellent character, it was not a case for the decision of the Magistrates, but for a jury to decide. The prisoners were therefore committed to the Supreme Court. Bail was allowed.</p>
<p>Another correspondent also reported the case to the paper and from that it was gleaned that the name of the younger prisoner was Joseph Leeson, that the case took from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and that the proprietors of several adjacent runs were present, along with respectable Burra tradesmen, Mr Cole MP, Mr E.L. Grundy and other gentlemen from a distance. The prosecutors and the prisoner occupy contiguous runs.</p>

<p>Government Schools</p>
<p>In the last quarter of 1863 there were 247 schools connected with the Board of Education and 11,769 students – an increase of 20 schools, but only 352 scholars on the last quarter of 1862. This is due to epidemics of sickness preventing children from attending. Some of the illness itself may be due to the poorly ventilated schools and crowded conditions.</p>
<p>Nearly all the schools established in the past three years are in outlying districts. The number of licensed teachers in Adelaide in 1858 was 38 and now it is 24. The city schools remain, but they are no longer connected with the Board because the teachers were disinclined to reduce their charges as required and so threw up their licences. It is thought there are about 8,000 more scholars at private schools.</p>
<p>The average stipend paid by the Board is £53-10-0 p.a.</p>
<p>Destitute scholars have increased from 913 to 1042.</p>

<p>Fire. A very destructive fire this morning completely destroyed the store room and shop of W.H. Stanbury. It was discovered at about 4 a.m. and by 5 a.m. all was gone. The adjourning surgery of Dr Maurau, a wooden building, was also consumed. Dr Maurau’s house was saved with difficulty – wet blankets being laid on the roof and along with other efforts the struggle was successful.</p>
<p>The National Bank was in grave danger; the windows next to the store were completely burnt, their glass melting and running like water. Mr Wilkinson the manager and Mr McKeevor the police-trooper strove to prevent the fire entering the bank and though they were successful, the stairs etc. were so hot that they could not be touched.</p>
<p>The dead wall between the shop and Mr Stanbury’s house saved it, though the doors were burnt. Everything was taken out of the house as a precaution.</p>
<p>Last week’s fire did not have an inquest as there was no loss, but here the loss cannot be less than £6,000 to £7,000 – part of which we believe to be insured.</p>

<p>An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms before Mr Marshall MacDermott SM on the fire at W.H. Stanbury’s store on 26 January with J. Winnall as foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Charles Drew, storekeeper. Was returning from Black Springs at c. 3.45 a.m. Tuesday morning in the company of Mr Drake and Howard. We passed up the hill between the Bank and Mr Chappell’s. Did not see the fire until we reached the gate into our yard. As Mr Drake opened the gate I observed fire issue from Stanbury’s skylight and went to raise the alarm at Stanbury’s house. Mr Stanbury came out as I arrived. I flung a bucket or two of water on the roof next to Stanbury’s house and then noticed the varnish and paint oozing out of the Bank’s windows. In a moment or two they were ablaze. Went round to the Bank and entered by the back door and was going upstairs when I met Mr Wilkinson. Got a bucket of water and threw it on one of the windows. The powder exploded while I was throwing water on the roof – not much of it judging from the explosion.</p>
<p>Henry Drake. Saw the flames coming out of the building in one sheet. Gave the alarm and ran to the Bank. I also called Mr Chappell, Mr Dyer and the policeman. Then went up the street giving the alarm as far as Mr Robert’s. On returning I went up the hill by which time the roof was a mass of flames. Went to the Bank and helped carry water upstairs. Saw no sign of the fire until I was getting out of the cart about 100 yards away. About 20 persons were present on my return. The wind was blowing towards the creek and Dr Maurau’s. The flame was six feet above the skylight. The powder exploded while I was coming back – perhaps six minutes after I saw the fire.</p>
<p>Charles Bock. At3.30 was in my yard and on going back to my house saw the glare of fire. Crossed the road and ran up the hill. Went to see where the fire was and discovered it was at Mr Stanbury’s store. Went up the street rousing people and then returned and went up by the Bank. Saw no one there and so returned and gave the alarm down the street. In front of Mr Chappell’s I met Mr McKeevor the policeman. I stayed till the fire was put out. There was a crowd there when it was got under using the water from Mr Stanbury’s tank. I was at work behind the store. The first water cart came before daylight. I was not at the Bank, but saw water used from the Bank and also the little force pump at Mr Stanbury’s store. The fire smouldered till 7 p.m. When I left the roofs had fallen in.</p>
<p>John Peters. Am a miner and was returning from the Mine soon after 3 a.m. Passed in front of the store and saw no indication of fire or any smell of it. There was a stiff breeze from the southwest. Went home to my house near the new bridge. After half an hour I heard a crash and in ten t fifteen minutes more my wife said she heard cries of murder and there were sounds of talking and running. Went and saw Mr Stanbury’s store on fire. Stayed till evening. There were about 20 there when I arrived and the roof had fallen in. When I got to the fire the surgery was just catching fire. No one came with me [on my way home from the Mine], my mates went over the hill.</p>
<p>Francis Cook. Live at Mr G. Bennet’s and was awakened between 3 and 4 by Miss Cox who called ‘Fire’. Got dressed and went to the Bank and also went to the Police Station and gave the alarm. Woke Mr Cowper, called Mrs Bennet. It was then 3.45 a.m. Called out the Champion, who was crossing the creek, to fetch the pump. Before I got to the store there was an explosion and the shutters were blown out and the roof fell in. Set the pump to work and used water from Stanbury’s tank. Directed the water onto the wash house. Mr Jones was pumping. I helped them at the windows of the bank and afterwards at Dr Maurau’s. At times there was plenty of water from the water cart. The Burra fire engine [from the Mine] did not arrive until about 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Dr Maurau. I reside at Kooringa on the north side of Mr Stanbury’s store. On Tuesday morning the household was awakened between 3 and 4 by a loud noise. I ran out the back and saw a large column of flame coming from one of Mr Stanbury’s roofs. It was about six feet wide and 30 feet high and was roaring. I ran through to the front and noticed the crates were not on fire. I was at once satisfied that nothing could save Stanbury’s store. I began clearing the surgery with a view to cutting it down. I lost 15 minutes saving my books etc. from my house. The surgery had ignited before I could cut it down – I believe from the crates in front. I had extreme difficulty in preventing the roof of the dwelling house from catching fire. I kept throwing water on it from my tank, which got the water back from my guttering. It was just daylight when the danger to my roof passed. Not more than twenty or thirty minutes had passed from first seeing the fire till then. There is only a party wall between the surgery and the store and so the surgery might have caught fire from the store. There were scores of men in front, but not one of them attempted to roll the crates away. Always thought the premises to be dangerous. The walls were of stone, but very rotten. The shop and storehouse communicated by a door through the stone wall and also a door led to the dwelling house. The roofs were of paling and the shop was ceiled in zinc. The storeroom was not ceiled.</p>
<p>W.H. Stanbury. Went to bed at 11 p.m. I and a little girl were the last in the store. We had a candle on the counter and I took it upstairs. I did not remain in the store after closing, only to get the books and the candle. Kerosene and oil were in the storehouse not in the store. There were not more than three kegs of oil and two cases of kerosene – about 16 gallons. There was less than 12 lb of powder. There were no loose matches around and I am sure no sparks fell from the sperm candle. I always take the books to the house at night. The stock in the shop was c. £4,000 and in the storeroom about £2,000. Am insured for £4,000.</p>
<p>John Kelly. Am shopman for Mr Stanbury. Left the store at 7.15. There was then a candle on the counter. All matches were in boxes and the goods were put away. The fire was nearly out when I got there. The stock at the time was the best we have had for a long time.</p>
<p>Margaret O’Brien. Servant to Mr Stanbury. The door of my bedroom goes into the store [room]. There is no other door into it. I was not in the store that night. It was either Mr or Mrs Stanbury that awakened me. There was no light to be seen till I got out of the room to the kitchen.</p>
<p>The verdict was of accidental fire with no evidence as to its origin. Besides the insurance on the stock, the buildings were insured in the South Australian for £550, but £100 of that was for the dwelling house so the loss to the office will be £450.</p>

<p>Accident. Mr A. Riggs of Diprose’s Creek was thrown from his horse when it shied as he passed over the bridge near there. He fell against one of the posts, breaking an arm and suffering other injuries.</p>
<p>Accident. On Tuesday at about 6.30 p.m. while two miners were down securing, the earth slipped and ran, carrying the men with it for 8 or 9 fathoms. It was 11 p.m. before they could be released. One sustained a broken thigh and the other a broken jawbone. They are called Kitto and Hocking or Hoskins and have not been long on the Mine.</p>

<p>Two inquests were held at Canowie before Mr MacDermott SM on recent fires there.</p>
<p>The first fire on 18 January was extensive and destructive.</p>
<p>Thomas Goode. Manager of Canowie Run. The fire began on the north-eastern part of the run on Belaley Plains [sic: Belalie] where two well sinkers were at work. About 60 square miles were burnt between 1.30 p.m. on 18 January and 8.30 a.m. on 19 January. Probably it started from the well-sinking camp, though they had burnt an area 22 feet all round their fire as ordered. The fire extended 16 miles north-south and destroyed about 360 sheep, 2 empty huts and 20-30 bush yards. As well as the Canowie Run it burnt some 9 miles on the Booborowie Run.</p>
<p>John Toovey. Well Sinker. Had cleared a space of at lest eight yards around our fire and built around it a shelter about three feet high with the material from the well. Covered the fire when going to work. Came up in the ascending bucket at about 2 p.m. and saw the grass on fire. Believe a whirlwind caught up embers and blew them onto the grass.</p>
<p>The verdict was that the fire was accidentally caused without proof of culpable negligence on the part of any person.</p>
<p>The second inquest followed a fire on the same run at a place called Menowie on 29 January.</p>
<p>This time the fire was discovered early by Mr D. Cudmore Jnr and Frederick Lester of Yongala Station and they managed to extinguish it before any serious damage was done.</p>
<p>The verdict was that the fire arose from causes unknown with no evidence of whether it was accidental or malicious in origin.</p>
<p>The Campbell Minstrels gave another performance on Thursday evening to a pretty full house. They intend to return in seven to ten days.</p>

<p>Court Case re Sheep Stealing</p>
<p>[There is a very long report of a case of alleged sheep stealing. The length of the report reflects the popularity of the accused and the suggestion that it was based on false and malicious evidence.]</p>
<p>Joseph Leeson and Aaron Cole were accused of stealing three ewes to the value of £1-10-0 and three wethers to the value of £1-10-0 on 31 October in the Hundred of Kingston, the sheep being the property of J. &amp; A. Hallett.</p>
<p>There were additional charges relating to the killing and receiving of the sheep.</p>
<p>Michael Honan, shepherd identified the sheepskins. Am employed by J. &amp; A. Hallett. The skins were found within 30 yards of Coles’ hut. Tiver &amp; Coles’ property was in the centre of Hallett’s Run. Had gone looking for the skins on a tip-off from a man named Netherey, who had left the employ of Tiver &amp; Cole.</p>
<p>James Netherey.</p>
<p>Saw a sheep with an ‘H’ brand on it slaughtered at Tiver &amp; Coles’. The carcase fed the shearers. A second case occurred shortly later. Leeson was present at the first killing, but not at the second. He was there at a third killing a few days later. Mr Cole killed the sheep.</p>
<p>[The evidence is reported in great detail. Cole is said to have been the cook for the shepherds – though the rest of the paragraph suggest he was cooking for the shearers. Perhaps he was cooking for both.]</p>
<p>Netherey – Was not involved in killing the sheep, but helped to skin and eat them. The first sheep lasted five or six days. Messrs Tiver &amp; Cole had asked him to go and clear them, but he said he would not perjure himself.</p>
<p>[From his wife’s evidence Netherey was afraid of being transported and that was his supposed motivation for giving evidence and revealing the offence.]</p>
<p>George Seigart [sic], shepherd. Can identify the skins as Hallett’s.</p>
<p>Helen Netherey, wife of John Netherey. In November Leeson had admitted killing the sheep in her presence. I wanted to leave the employ of Tiver &amp; Cole when the sheep were killed.</p>
<p>The defence alleged that the track from Hallett’s to Burra passed close to Cole’s where the skins were found.</p>
<p>His Honour said that loads of Hallett’s skins were taken along this track and the skins could either have fallen from a load or been placed there by the witness or by person’s unknown.</p>
<p>The law did not allow the convicting of the prisoners by the evidence of a person involved in the offence unless supported by other witnesses. Netherey’s evidence could therefore not convict unless corroborated by other witnesses. His Honour could not, in the present state of the case advise them to convict the prisoners. They could hear the rest of the case if they wished.</p>
<p>The jury decided the case should proceed.</p>
<p>James Tiver was called by the defence.</p>
<p>Had been present throughout the shearing except for Saturday nights and Sundays. A young bull was the shearers’ meat for about a fortnight, after which they began to complain. A sheep of Tiver &amp; Coles’ was then killed and two other sheep, their own property and branded ‘T’ were also killed during the shearing. Netherey did not leave of his own accord. He was dismissed. None of the sheep killed during the shearing belonged to Mr Hallett. Had never asked Netherey to come over to clear him, but to clear the matter up.</p>
<p>George P. Colville. Was employed by Tiver &amp; Cole during the shearing and can corroborate Mr Tiver’s account.</p>
<p>James Tiver (aged 11) also corroborated Mr Tiver’s account.</p>
<p>John Smith, another employee of Tiver &amp; Cole.</p>
<p>Have known Netherey for four or five years and could not rely on his word or oath.</p>
<p>Hannah Box, wife of the bailiff of the Redruth Court.</p>
<p>Had heard Netherey say he liked Tiver very well, but ‘he did not like Mr Cole. He would hang him if he could.’</p>
<p>Character references for Cole were given by Thomas Box (bailiff), George Hiles (sheep farmer) and William Dale.</p>
<p>After His Honour had summed up the jury acquitted the prisoners without hesitation.</p>

<p>Article from the Mining Journal of 19 December 1863.</p>
<p>Supplies of copper ores from Chile have declined and demand is increasing. The development of copper mines in SA is therefore most opportune. There is reason to believe copper prices will rise. The SA mines are prolific in rich ores and it is therefore commercial sense at this time that they be brought to full and speedy production ‘by energetic management and labour and the careful application of capital.’</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine yielded to the six months ending 31 March 1863 4,348 ton of ore at an average 23% pure metal. The Moonta Mine, which is of only two years’ standing, has produced 5,611 tons of ore within six months at an average 18% with a cost of raising of only £4-15-7 per ton.</p>
<p>Blinman Mine, which started only in August 1862, already furnished almost 400 tons per month.</p>
<p>‘It is interesting to mention the fact that the gentleman who has recently been nominated to the proud position of Prime Minister [i.e. Premier] of that colony was, and we believe still is, the secretary of the Burra Burra Mine, and has throughout his residence in South Australia been identified, we believe exclusively, with mining enterprise. He left this country as a mere emigrant; he embraced mining industry; and now rules the destiny of a colony which is unquestionably full of import to the mining word, and rising rapidly in every branch which establishes the importance of a nation.’</p>
<p>‘Espagna’ writes on the origin of the word ‘Merino’.</p>
<p>It is a Spanish word, corrupted from the Latin ‘merinas’ or Majorinus’ implying a superintendent of sheepwalks; hence the Spanish ‘merinos ovejas’ or sheep under the care of the merino or major. There are two kinds of sheep in Spain. The coarse-woolled do not travel and are housed inside in winter. The fine-woolled spend all their time in the open air and at the end of summer migrate from the cool northern mountains to the warm southern plains of Estramadura and Leon for winter. Lately their number was estimated at 4,000,000. These ‘merinos’ are also called ‘transhumentes’ because of their annual migration.</p>
<p>[Further details of this sheep migration are given with a suggestion that transhumance might improve the wool of sheep in Australia as well.]</p>

It started within two miles of the line of telegraph from Clare to Burra Road and ran for 12 miles towards Bundaleer and 4 miles wide between Hill Town and Burra. About 70 persons battled the blaze. The overseer Mr Hanquest assisted them with horses, food and liquors. An inquest will be held today at Cross Roads Inn.</p>
<p>The disease amongst cattle, which I first reported in your columns, is still raging. Many cattle are dying. I do not believe it to be pleuro-pneumonia, not is it contagious. One or two in a herd may die and the others exhibit no symptoms of disease whatsoever.</p>

<p>Drinking in the Bush</p>
<p>‘An Observer and a Sympathizer’ writes from Far North 5 March:</p>
<p>All too many of those in the bush are excessively fond of strong drink and will soon be lost to society unless saved miraculously.</p>
<p>‘Our “bush public-houses” are vile drinking shanties; not the home of travellers, as they should be. In those houses you can be made “real mad” in an hour, and remain so as long as your “cheque” will last; and at night be huddled together like swine in a sty, only less cleanly and more piggish. Here from a man from “Oxford” or “Cambridge” to the lowest “bullocky” in the province, they lie and welter from night to morn; and rising, “seek it yet again.”’</p>

<p>Good Friday was a general holiday and the town was almost deserted as people headed off duck-shooting, cray-fishing etc.</p>
<p>On Easter Sunday the Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary was held. Rev. R.C. Flockart preached twice and in the afternoon the children were examined by Rev. H. Chester. Mr Forder played the harmonium. There must have been quite 250 children on the special galleries erected either side of the pulpit and on the platform in front. On Monday some 300 of them assembled at the chapel at 11 a.m. before marching to the top of Limestone Hill, where a tent held an abundance of fruit and cake. Games were held till 4 p.m. when they returned to the schoolroom for tea and cake. The tent and school were both decorated with loads of green bushes to make arches and other ornamentation. Charles Drew presided at the meeting. There were 269 scholars on the roll compared with 208 the previous year. Attendance was not as good due to removals and the wet winter.</p>
<p>[Further details are printed.]</p>
<p>Several cricket matches were played on the ground opposite the Telegraph Station on Monday and races were held at Cross Roads.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening Rev. R.C. Flockart delivered his lecture on ‘Luther and the Reformation’ to a large and attentive audience. A collection was made on behalf of the chapel at Copperhouse or Westbury.</p>
<p>[At Westbury; because the chapel at Copperhouse was Primitive Methodist. Since Westbury completely failed to develop as a settlement and its chapel and a house or two were adjacent to Copperhouse, the Westbury Chapel was often referred to as the Copperhouse Chapel.]</p>

<p>[As a keeper of a public house in the Far North he contradicts the recent letter of ‘Observer and Sympathizer’ on the subject of Public Houses in that district, calling his attack totally unprincipled.]</p>
<p>Most public houses there have been erected at great expense and the reports which reached the Worshipful Bench that sat on the 14 &amp; 15 March to grant such licences found everything satisfactory. Several of those gentlemen have travelled in the Far North in the last two years and would have been able to have spoken of each case of complaint on its own merits. If ‘Sympathizer’ had any complaint he should have written to the proper authorities stating his grievance and naming the locality, so as to prevent this piggish shanty from receiving its licence again.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. [Editorial]</p>
<p>The 19th annual report of the SA Mining Association was adopted at the annual meeting of shareholders on 20 April. The Directors state that the productiveness of the Burra Burra Mine, though not quite equal to the yield of former times, is nevertheless very considerable. In the six months to 31 March the quantity of ore raised was 3,952 tons at an estimated 221⁄2%. Financial statements show the position of the Association on 30 September 1863. In the six months to that date ore raised was 4,131 tons at a cost of £10-2-1 per ton. The produce thus raised realised £55,700-16-2 or £13-9-8 per ton and yielded a profit of £13,956-16-5 or £3-7-7 per ton. The total profit was within a few hundred pounds of that estimated by the Directors in their last report.</p>
<p>The gross profits which were derived from these operations, ended on 30 September 1863 amounted to £14,759-11-5, which included £800 for rents and £2-15-0 for fees. Out of this £12,320 was approved for the payment of the 53rd dividend on 2 March, leaving a balance of £2,777-18-5. To this balance must now be added the estimated profit upon the ore raised in the past six months, which is estimated to be £15,383-1-10 to make the total balance £18,116-0-3. Out of this the 54th dividend will have to be paid.</p>
<p>The estimated profit is of course based on the present state of the copper market. The copper price has continued to rise in the past period with Burra Burra copper quoted in London in February last at £116 per ton. 380 tons are on their way to London and a good result is anticipated.</p>
<p>The Captain’s report of the state of the mine on 11 April is satisfactory. At Burra the last take of 9 weeks saw 1,130 tons raised. Pitches at Karkulto Mine also look promising. Ore there at the date of the report was copper 6 tons and iron 900 tons.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary [There is quite a detailed report of the discovery of the body of William Smith and of the inquest that followed. In essence as follows.]</p>
<p>Smith was a shepherd in the employ of Mr A. Barker of Baldina. He was a single Englishman with no known friends or relations locally, though he spoke of a sister in Brisbane. He had been sober while employed at Baldina, but had told Barker that he had previously been a heavy drinker in Victoria. He left about £14 in wages.</p>
<p>On Monday he was found dead in his hut at Baldina and seemed to have been dead about 36 hours. He was aged about 45 or 46. When discovered his face was badly disfigured by vermin. [Wild cats seem to have been suspected.] The body was otherwise free from injury and Dr Mayne concluded that death was probably due to heart disease. The jury returned verdict of death from natural causes.</p>

<p>[Gilberton does not appear in Manning’s Place Names of SA, but he does mention a Gilbert Town surveyed about 10 miles south of Saddleworth.] This stretch of c. 25 miles has been extensively bought up for agriculture and is now enclosed for farming.</p>
<p>[On the present road Riverton is 25 miles north of Gawler and 6 miles south of Saddleworth.]</p>
<p>This restricts the line of transit to a chain in width. Traffic has increased tenfold and in winter it is impassable in many places, forcing farmers to send produce to market prematurely and only during the time of year when the road is passable. The Government has made much money through the land sales and pledged to maintain the main line of road.</p>
<p>Motions were passed calling for the Government to honour its commitment and further action is assured, this being only a preliminary meeting.</p>

<p>[This article is on the follow-up meeting held at Grotegut’s Gawler Belt Inn on 18 May. The meeting is extensively reported and though there were more speakers and much greater detail is given, it is essentially a repeat of the arguments in the report of 13 May.]</p>
<p>The Old North Road</p>
<p>A very vigorous meeting was held at the North Star Inn at Templers on Thursday last of upwards of 100 farmers to consider the road from Gawler to Gilberton.</p>
<p>[The arguments paralleled those noted for the meeting at Gawler Belt. Some noteworthy examples of the problems are mentioned:</p>
<p>Mr Woods had taken two days with 12 bullocks to get 12 bags of corn ten miles.</p>
<p>Mr Newman: ‘Once was bogged on the Saturday and it took 20 bullocks and the best part of Sunday to get unbogged. Was once capsized in a Government waterhole with a load of flour and a fine piece of pastry it produced. On another occasion had a load of beer and wine and bottles drowned and in fishing for them half a day caught a cold and a full suit of mud.]</p>

<p>‘Traveller’ writes re the Redruth Bridge</p>
<p>Allow me to call attention to the dangerous state of the Redruth Bridge due to unwarrantable neglect. On the Aberdeen side directly adjoining the pier a deal plank has been inserted instead of gum. This naturally gave way and the hole has spread to about four planks wide, occasioning a serious shock to light vehicles, there being barely room to pass if the horse is at all skittish.</p>

<p>‘One of 32Years’ Standing’ writes re Mines and Minerals in SA.</p>
<p>[This is a long letter, but the essence of his complaint is that prospectors and miners are poorly treated in SA. Among his complaints:</p>
<p>It is as expensive for a miner to get 80 acres surveyed as for a squatter to get 80 square miles.</p>
<p>Sheep farmers can get 5 acres for 1d, while miners pay 50/-.</p>
<p>Why is this important industry so neglected by the Government? Roads have a Board, surveyors and other staff. Maritime and Harbours warrant another Board and staff. Mining occupies a corner of an office devoted to various other matters and the partial services of a clerk.</p>
<p>What is needed is completely free right to search for minerals and then the untrammelled occupation of small or large areas according to the means of the occupants. This would result in a healthy increase in imports, larger consumption of local products and an immense additional export of copper.]</p>

<p>Obituary. The funeral of the late Mrs Roberts took place on Sunday and was attended by nearly everyone. She was a class leader of the Wesleyan community. Her sudden death left a family of six children, the youngest a few days old. [Born Jane Shortland or Shourtland c. 1820: died 2 June 1864, Kooringa. She died in childbirth, being delivered of twin daughters. Jane Shourtland Roberts was born 2 June 1864, Kooringa: died 15 June 1864, Kooringa.

<p>W. Prince writes re Northern Roads:</p>
<p>During 15 years residence I have been through a few boggy roads, but I have never experienced such difficulty on account of the state of the roads as between Kapunda and Kooringa. Few vehicles escape unscathed. Horsemen are delayed and the mail is occasionally breaking down. It is time attention was devoted to the formation of a road from Kapunda to Kooringa.</p>

<p>Wesleyan Jubilee Services at Kooringa</p>
<p>Jubilee services of the Wesleyan Missionary Society were held in Kooringa last Sunday. Rev. S. Ironsides was the deputation from Adelaide and in the afternoon the service was taken by the Primitive Methodist minister Rev. J. Warner. On Monday a tea meeting was held at which 200 to 300 sat down. The public meeting followed with Mr J.R. Stephens presiding. [A full report is printed.]</p>

<p>Storekeepers are wondering if the Government will be as liberal in their terms to the squatters in renewing leases as the SA Mining Association are with their tenants.</p>
<p>In their case the more valuable one makes their property the more one has to pay for it should one desire a renewal of the lease. On the other hand should it be a losing bargain, the lease is quietly dropped and very seldom is anything more heard of it. The company’s remedy then is to pull the house down or let it for a low rental.</p>

<p>From the Report of E.H. Hargreaves</p>
<p>While at Kooringa I obtained through the kindness of Mr Porter at Springbank a fossil rock taken from a depth of 120 feet from Messrs Killicoat &amp; Ford’s station on the Eastern Plains. It contained a number of fossils belonging, I Suppose, to the Miocene Tertiary formation; genera turritella (very numerous), pectens, arca, cardia, lucina and others. I continued north, it being useless to search for gold in this formation.</p>
<p>Going north, I discovered, between Booborowie and Canowie a fossil rock containing numerous organic remains of the genus natica, elenchus and serpulœ, probably of the Pliocene Tertiary epoch and on the Bendiuta Plains the shells of the recent helix in great abundance and well preserved.</p>

<p>H.B. writes re the want of rain and challenging the view of some that squatters have made large fortunes:</p>
<p>After 25 miles from Burra and for 100 miles northeast there is noting but red earth and clouds of dust for four or five miles around all the wells and watering places. On several runs within 60 miles of Burra thousands of pounds have been spend on wells with little success. One run within 30 miles has sunk 12 to 15 wells from 80 to 140 feet and altogether they cannot water 3,000 sheep. Another run has sunk four wells to over 100 feet and found no water. Many wells sunk in the area are costly, being dug in hard rock and many are also unproductive. At this time of year the sheep are drinking from wells just as they do in summer and a flock of 1,400 ewes with lambs will drink 75 to 80 hogsheads of 60 gallons of water every other day. Each sheep will drink 2 to 3 gallons every other day. Even in a good year like 1863 the flocks needed wells except for four months and in three out of five years they need wells all the year round.</p>

<p>Accident. On Monday morning the foreman timberman Bennet Dally was down a shaft removing some timbers to put in a new sett and just as all was ready to send down the new timber the earth gave way and buried him with about three fathoms of earth. Men were there immediately, but could not believe he could be got out alive. After three hours’ work they found him almost unhurt. The timbers had fallen together so as to form a shield over him. He was able to walk home to his family who live on the mine. Captain Roach was so impressed with the efforts of Henry Pens in particular that he handed him over £2.</p>

<p>The half-yearly meeting of the Sa Mining Association is as usual a very satisfactory one.</p>
<p>The ore raised in the six months amounts to 3,462 tons, estimated to average 221⁄2% copper. This added to the 2,658 tons on hand at 31 March gives a total of 6,120 tons. Of this 3,873 tons have been delivered to the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. in the six months, leaving 2,247 tons on hand.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the six months there were upwards of 95 tons of copper on hand and in that period 533 tons have been received from the Smelting Co. for ore delivered, making a total of c. 628 tons. Of this 100 tons have been exported to Britain and 405 tons sold in the colony. 123 tons remain now on hand.</p>
<p>In the previous half-year ending 31 March 1864, 4,189 tons of ore were raised at a cost of £38,159-13-9 or £9-2-2 per ton realising £54,187-10-6 or £12-8-8 per ton for a nett profit of £16,027-16-9 or £3-16-8 per ton. Compared with the previous half-year less ore was raised, but the expenditure was less and the profits were thus larger by more than £2,000. To those profits are to be added £1,000 for rent and £6-2-6 for fees received for a total of £17,033-19-3 from which the 54th dividend paid on 3 October has been written off to leave a sum of £7,491-17-8 to credit of profit, covering all transactions to 31 March 1864.</p>
<p>Since the last half-yearly meeting the copper price has fallen from £116 per ton to £101 per ton and the good prices anticipated for the copper shipped have not been realised.</p>
<p>Captain Roach’s Report</p>
<p>Sumpmen are extending the 60 fathom level south from Morphett’s Engine Shaft in which the lode is small and unproductive. In the 40 fathom level a crosscut is driving southwest from Peacock’s Air Shaft and several branches of high grade ore have been cut; some of 57% and others in red oxide of copper at 66%. A lode five feet wide has been cut near Waterhouse’s Shaft in blue and green carbonate of copper, but not of the richest quality. Pitches at and near Peacock’s Main and Air Shafts continue to produce ore of the usual quality and quantity. Pitches at Ayers and Graham’s Shafts No. 1 &amp; 2 are much the same as usual. Pitches at Kingston’s Shaft No. 2 have recently improved. Pitches at Penney’s, Paxton’s, Stocks’s and Roach’s Shafts are unchanged. Beck’s workings have exceeded expectations. There are presently 75 pitches at work.</p>
<p>Karkulto Mine</p>
<p>Two men are sinking the new shaft and are at 22 fathoms. The lode is two to three feet wide, chiefly iron with some good stones of copper. Driving north from diagonal shaft No. 2 the lode is three feet wide and while not rich is promising. Nine tributers are at work.</p>

<p>Accident. Mr Harris was proceeding north with a survey party last Saturday with a dray loaded with almost a ton of rations etc. At a steep slope about six miles beyond Chewing’s station and 36 miles north of Burra, the two leaders headed down slope just as a wheel passed over a stone and the dray was hurled completely over. Mr Harris was seated in the front between the driver and Mr Morris, a surveyor. The other two were thrown clear, but Mr Harris seems to have been struck on the hip by the falling load and the iron rail of the dray came down on the small of his back. He could not be released for almost ten minutes. Medical aid was sent for and a gentleman recently arrived by the Murray travelled all night and found Mr Harris in a very low state. After treatment Mr Morris constructed an ingenious litter and Mr Harris was conveyed carefully to Burra where he is being attended by the Doctor and Mrs Harris.</p>

<p>Squatters’ Grievances</p>
<p>[The squatters had protested loudly over the revaluation of their runs by Mr Goyder and the fact that they would have to pay their licence fees in advance. They demanded and got a select committee to look into the matter.]</p>
<p>‘Bushman Now’ writes from Kooringa 14 November.</p>
<p>Squatters may have to pay their rent in advance, but they pay little else in advance or even when due. Wages are often paid months and in some cases years after being earned. I have known cases where a shepherd has left £400 and upward in the squatter’s hands without interest. If capital is worth 10% the interest would match his annual wages of £40. Meanwhile the squatter was getting the shepherd’s services essentially for nothing and charging a profit of 80% on all the necessaries he had to buy.</p>
<p>Squatters insist on their servants dealing at their store and rarely cash an order for a hawker – and when they do a charge of 10% is made.</p>
<p>Other ‘disadvantages’ of the squatter:</p>
<p>They can without charge cut down scrub to make fences, cut timber for firewood, for building, for timbering wells, for huts, for troughs or to make charcoal. They are allowed to bark trees for roofing etc. They have unrestricted use of limestone and building stone. Freeholders and leaseholders in the Hundreds do not have such privileges. Mineral leaseholders pay a far greater rent and yet do not have such privileges, though they employ more hands and expend more capital.</p>

<p>Fire</p>
<p>A large fire started on Saturday on Gum Creek Station and soon spread over the hill towards Copperhouse. Men from the Mine fought it and it turned northeast towards Mr Vickery’s. His place suffered severely. Mr Hallett’s Run was also alight, along with Captain Killicoat’s purchased land, Mr Gebhardt’s and the Mt Bryan Run. It is still burning and has affected Booborowie, Gum Creek, Wildoto [sic] and Wandillah Runs and the runs of Mr Barker at Mt Bryan. It is the largest fire near the town for many years.</p>
<p>Fire</p>
<p>On Sunday morning at about 10.15 the stables of Mr N. Opie at the Smelters’ Home Hotel were discovered to be on fire. Three valuable horses were there. Mr T. Paynter who lives there at once opened the door and tried to free the horses. He untied one and another broke its rope. The third was burnt. The two sho got out had their eyes burnt. One will not recover and the other will never be of much use. The stable was a wooden building and soon burnt. A stack of hay and a large quantity of harness were also consumed. The Mine fire engine attended and a number of men and it at least enabled them to quench the embers to prevent further mischief. The cause is unknown.</p>

<p>Inquest</p>
<p>On Friday 25 November an inquest was held into the fire at Mr Opie’s on Tuesday last. Mr Godson was foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Cyprian Stanton:</p>
<p>Saw the fire from the other side of the creek as I was going to church. It was nearly out when I came. When I was coming away I saw a little boy William Roberts who said that he was lighting a squib, which burst in his hand. He threw it down and the stables caught fire. He then ran away and hid in the creek. He asked me to take him home, but I was late and did not do so. The fire engine arrived while I was at the fire. The child is four years old this month.</p>
<p>John Henwood:</p>
<p>Was on Quarry Hill between 10 and 11 a.m. and saw the place on fire. Do not know how it happened.</p>
<p>Thomas Paynter:</p>
<p>Was in the stables at 9 a.m. Fed the horses and left all safe. About 10.15 heard a cry of fire. Ran and opened the stable. Untied one horse, but could not untie another because of the fire. Do not know how it started. I saw the fire at the end where the hay was. I do not smoke. Saw no one about. Did not see the boy there.</p>
<p>Nicholas Opie”</p>
<p>Between 10 and 11 was in the barn. Heard Mrs Opie cry out that the stable was on fire. Saw Paynter open the door and try to free the horses. I began to tear down the stable to let the horses out. Two broke their halters and fled through the door. One was burnt to death. Saw no one about and cannot account for the fire. Was not smoking when I went out. Have seen children about with squibs in the last week.</p>
<p>Mrs Opie:</p>
<p>Was in the kitchen about 10.30. My little boy was going round to the front when he turned and called, ‘The stable is on fire.’ Called Mr Opie. Saw Paynter open the door. Did not go outside. Did not see the boy about.</p>
<p>William Roberts:</p>
<p>The child left my house in Market Square at about 10.30 a.m. My wife sent him to the opposite side of the creek to ask after his mother.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Ann Champion:</p>
<p>Saw the child W. Roberts on Sunday morning in Paxton Square. Helped him cross the creek near to Mr Blackney’s. The fire was burning at the time the bells were ringing for church.</p>
<p>The jury decided there was no evidence to show the origin of the fire.</p>
<p>Inquest</p>
<p>An inquest on the fire that occurred at Gum Creek decided that it was caused by the carelessness of some bullock drivers who have been summoned to the Local Court.</p>
<p>The Full Court was held on Wednesday and Thursday and a man called Matthews was fined £5 for lighting a fire on Canowie Run without taking the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>Thursday was survey day at the Mine and 14 pitches were refused, many of the miners being off to Wallaroo and Moonta.</p>
<p>30 November 1864, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 29 November</p>
<p>Fire. On Sunday another destructive fire took place on the run of Messrs Duffield &amp; Porter. It arose somewhere near the lagoon at Black Springs and travelled towards Mintaro and the Wheelbarrow Hills till stopped by roads. A small part of Gum Creek Run was also burnt.</p>
<p>Mr Opie estimates the loss by the fire at his place at £200.</p>
<p>Obituary. Mr Isaac Holder, formerly a sergeant in H.M. 96th and armourer to Captain Sturt’s expedition has died. He had been living in Kooringa for some time. He was much respected here for his civility, his business habits and his cleanliness in his trade as a butcher. [Isaac Holder died 26 November 1864, Kooringa aged 56.]</p>
<p>A great many more miners left this week for Wallaroo. Many miners complain that they cannot work underground at the Mine due to the noxious gases emanating from the decaying wood with which it is timbered. If this is so, it should be looked into before the accumulation of fire damp in blocked passages results in an explosion.</p>
<p>6 December 1864, page 3</p>
<p>‘Bushman Now’ writes on 28 November</p>
<p>[He writes to explain some of the costs of the squatter in the north.]</p>
<p>Huts are for the most part pine with a thatched roof and cost perhaps £10. A brush yards may be erected for £3 to £5 or even more cheaply.</p>
<p>Sheep are generally run in flocks of 2,000 and weaners often of 3,000. If the shepherd is a married man he gets £40 p.a. and double rations, which are 1⁄2 lb tea, 4 lb sugar, 20 lb flour and a sheep a week – or in many places two in three weeks. Costs? Tea of the cheapest sort say 1/- for half a pound. Sugar of the blackest and cheapest, say 4 lb for 1/4. Good quality flour say 4/6 for 20 lb. The sheep are invariably aged ewes past bearing lambs – no one thinks of chewing it – merely softening it a little and then bolting it.</p>
<p>Thus the pay for a married couple is 15/4 plus rations worth 6/10 or say £1-2-0 a week, plus the sheep in question. The squatters argue this is too much. They thus have cheaper labour than the struggling cockatoo and feed their servants worse. Wearing apparel costs 60 to 80% more than in Adelaide. Their children get no education and the family forgoes membership of any religious body and also health, for they are deprived of vegetables. The only group who may accumulate money are men with three or four lads from 8 to 18 who may have an extra flock or two to herd. Where better have been made such as a stone building, they are on purchased land with surface water included and located strategically to discourage anyone else from later bidding for the run.</p>
<p>12 December 1864, page 2</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 10 December</p>
<p>Fire. Thursday 8 December will long be remembered for there was a strong hot wind and the atmosphere was darkened by clouds of dust and smoke, the latter from a large bushfire raging on adjoining stations. It is said to have begun at Mannanarie and travelled very rapidly southwards, at one place timed at 9 miles in 45 minutes. Overseers are at a loss of what to do with their sheep.</p>
<p>Cudmore’s Run (Yongala) is totally burned and has no feed and so too is Canowie, where stables and haystack at the head station were destroyed. Several houses and an imported bull died and sheep losses are an unconfirmed 3,000.</p>
<p>Chewing’s &amp; McCulloch’s runs are badly affected, but there is no detail available yet.</p>
<p>Mt Bryan run is nearly all burnt and about 300 sheep killed. The head station was saved with difficulty.</p>
<p>Vickery’s is burnt out with no feed escaping.</p>
<p>Booborowie run is two thirds burnt and the head station saved only with great exertion.</p>
<p>There are as yet unconfirmed reports of several people lost and shepherds burnt. Mr Armstrong of Booborowie sent for help to Mr H. Dawson in Kooringa and 20 to 30 men went out to assist. They would have achieved little had not the wind changed at 7 o’clock. At one time the front was over 20 miles wide. It would have spread even further had not the burnt ground from previous fire prevented it.</p>
<p>13 December 1864, page 3</p>
<p>Fire in the North</p>
<p>A traveller from the North confirms the report of the fire from our Kooringa correspondent. So complete was the destruction on Chewing’s run that he says it is now incapable of sustaining as many as 500 sheep and their only alternative is to sell the surviving stock.</p>
<p>15 December 1864, page 3</p>
<p>‘An Assistant’ writes saying that despite a setback to the early closing movement because five or six drapers refused to comply with just and reasonable demands, the movement will persist:</p>
<p>If all would agree to close earlier none would be losers. As it is shop assistants work 12 to 13 hours a day and 18 hours on Saturday. Labourers work only 10 hours and have Saturday as a half holiday. The request is to close at 6 p.m. in winter and 7 p.m. in summer and at 9 p.m. on Saturday. Retail drapers close at an earlier hour than this in London and other large centres in England and many have Saturday as a half holiday.</p>

<p>Mr Barlow and his troupe have been entertaining the younger portion of the town’s population with performances of his monkeys and dogs.</p>
<p>The exodus to Wallaroo continues; four large wagonloads started on Monday.</p>
<p>One flock of sheep on Mt Bryan Run unexpectedly survived the fire when a shepherd and his faithful dogs kept rounding them up at a fork between two roads.</p>
<p>Mr McCulloch’s Run is damaged to the extent of three flocks of sheep.</p>
<p>Chewing’s Run is severely burned and at Yongala they have found the northern portion saved.</p>
<p>It is said the fire may have started from the malice or neglect of a discarded shepherd.</p>
<p>Trade here is slack.</p>
<p>A large picnic is planned for Christmas to come off a few miles from the Burra.</p>
<p>23 December 1864, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 22 December</p>
<p>Edward Camfield, cook to Mr Burkitt’s party travelling sheep, was fined £5 plus costs for lighting a fire without taking proper precautions.</p>
<p>The ford over the creek at Redruth was finished last Saturday and it presents a most creditable appearance for the contractors, who have been much delayed by the prevailing epidemic amongst working bullocks. The first contractor for supplying the necessary timber lost 29 bullocks and the second lost 8.</p>
<p>The ford will be a great improvement and is metalled with the best wearing stone in the colony.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a horse bolted and a man was run over by a dray as a consequence, but fortunately without serious hurt. Business is slack and the removals to Wallaroo are still plentiful.</p>
<p>30 December 1864, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 29 December</p>
<p>Monday 26 December was a holiday and the grand picnic that was planned took place. The weather was ideal. The spot chosen was a paddock of Mr Reed’s five or six miles from Kooringa on the Adelaide Road. It was free from dust and the trees afforded shelter. Commodious tents had been erected by the committee and other arrangements reflected credit on that body. In all it was a great success and every conveyance in the town was pressed into service. At one time there must have been fully 200 horses in the paddock and over 100 vehicles. There were over 1,000 people on the ground and they enjoyed themselves amazingly. There were tents for refreshments, though no intoxicating liquor was allowed on the ground for sale. Mrs Reed superintended the tea and coffee department, which was in great demand. Mr F. Gebhardt had a tent supplying the solids and fruit. Games and amusements were organised including cricket, quoits, football, foot races, jumping in sacks, wheelbarrow races and hunting a pig. An efficient band was in attendance all day. Dancing was popular and kiss-in-the-ring by juveniles. There was also a rifle match. Everything went off without an accident or the hint of a quarrel.</p>
<p>Tuesday was taken as a holiday by storekeepers, who preferred to have their two days at leisure at once instead of on Wednesday.</p>
<p>7 January 1865, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 5 January</p>
<p>Monday 2 January was generally kept as a holiday.</p>
<p>There were some races at Mt Bryan Flat Hotel that attracted a few Burra people.</p>
<p>There have been two or three small bushfires about, but people are not much concerned, believing there is little left to burn.</p>
<p>The picnic turned out to be such a success that the committee is left with a considerable surplus when they has anticipated a deficit. Mr Rounsevell has been thanked by the committee for the use of his mail cart on the day.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. Richard Crews was riding from Burra towards Mt Remarkable on Friday 6 January when not far from Burra his horse threw him. He seems to have landed on his head, dislocating his cervical vertebra and dying instantly. An inquest was held before Mr MacDermott SM at the White Hart Hotel and after hearing the evidence of Dr Peel, a verdict of accidental death was returned.</p>
<p>[Richard Crews died 6 January 1865 between Kooringa and Booborowie, residence Melrose aged 29.]</p>
<p>At the Full Court on 29 December 1864 James and Thomas Tucker were each fined £3 plus costs for lighting a fire on crown land without taking the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>David Edwards, James Symons and Edward Stevens were fined 5/-, 20/- and 10/- respectively with costs for illegally depasturing cattle on crown lands.</p>

<p>Nothing has been done in relation to the election since a meeting attended by not more than a dozen persons. There will not be much expense attached to the election as it was resolved not to advertise, but just to send the bellman around calling the meeting.</p>
<p>Peter McIntyre and Alfred Hack were fined respectively £2 &amp; £5 with costs for travelling with sheep without giving notice according to the Act.</p>
<p>Several parties are returning from Wallaroo as many could not get work there, but the families of others are going, so the population here remains about the same.</p>

<p>An election meeting was held at the Burra Hotel tonight with upwards of 150 present. Mr T.S. Porter presided. Messrs Cole and Neales addressed the meeting and answered questions. A proposition supporting Mr Cole was moved, but an amendment that they should wait for other candidates to come forward was carried. A vote endorsing Mr Neales was carried unanimously.</p>

<p>Election Meeting</p>
<p>About 80 electors assembled at the Aberdeen Hotel in Redruth [actually in Aberdeen] on Wednesday 8 February to hear candidates for election explain their views. Mr O. Harvey presided.</p>
<p>Mr G.W. Cole:</p>
<p>On the question of the squatters’ runs he would uphold Goyder’s valuations.</p>
<p>On roads he thought the north had been shamefully neglected and he would endeavour to get a large share of the £250,000 that it was proposed to borrow for roadwork directed to northern roads.</p>
<p>On immigration he understood there was a need for agricultural labourers, but he was opposed to any further importation of miners.</p>
<p>J.B. Neales:</p>
<p>He thought it was a mistake to be holding a meeting at Aberdeen, so close to where a meeting had been held the previous night. He had explained his views there and was not in the habit of changing them the next day.</p>
<p>He strongly supported much greater expenditure on northern roads.</p>
<p>He would not like to see immigration completely stopped, but it needed to suit the needs of the colony. He thought that assisted immigration was better than immigration completely funded by the colony, as it attracted a better class of migrant.</p>
<p>He was not in favour of any direct taxation or poll tax, though he did support an income tax on absentees.</p>
<p>More of the money appropriated for education should be spent in country areas. He was in favour of reading the Bible in schools.</p>
<p>Motions were carried declaring both candidates fit and proper persons to be elected.</p>

<p>Two election meeting have been held at which Messrs Neales and Cole addressed electors.</p>

<p>The weather conditions have been exceedingly dusty.</p>
<p>10 February 1865, page 3</p>
<p>Election Meeting</p>
<p>Upwards of 150 persons gathered at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday 7 February to hear the views of the candidates for Parliament. Mr T.S. Porter presided.</p>
<p>Mr Cole:</p>
<p>No other district has been more neglected in the mater of roads than the District of Burra. He had supported extending the line of main roads to Mt Remarkable and Mt Bryan. (Though the Bill had failed.) Up to 1860 not more than £130 had been spent on main lines of road in the District of Burra. Since then £80 had been voted for a road through Kooringa.</p>
<p>He supported Mr Goyder’s fitness for the task of revaluing the runs and supported his reports. If the leased were refused they should go to public auction and if there was no bid should be cut up into blocks for the convenience of purchasers.</p>
<p>He had opposed the vote of £50,000 for new Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>Agricultural land should be opened up as required and not in large blocks – he thought the 80 acre system had worked well. He favoured deferred payments for land.</p>
<p>He favoured the continuation of the ad valorem* duties.</p>
<p>He did not support the importation of miners.</p>
<p>[Ad valorem duties on imports: taxes paid in proportion to the estimated value of goods.]</p>
<p>Mr Neales:</p>
<p>The interests of the district had been neglected with respect to roads and it was more the fault of electors because they had failed to direct attention to the matter.</p>
<p>Goyder’s valuations had become the law of the land and he did not think many squatters would throw up their leases as a result.</p>
<p>It was useless to sell farmers land if roads were not provided for the movement of their produce. A Bill had been passed in the House for borrowing £250,000 for roads, but the Upper House had thrown out the Road Bill so they had no machinery to work the money with.</p>
<p>He though new houses of Parliament could wait ten years.</p>
<p>He favoured ad valorem duties.</p>
<p>He considered the present mineral regulations unfair and disadvantaged miners in SA compared with other colonies.</p>
<p>[Both candidates then answered a series of questions from electors.]</p>
<p>11 February 1865, page 2</p>
<p>Election Meeting</p>
<p>Messrs G.W. Cole &amp; J.B. Neales attended the newly appointed polling place of Steelton on Thursday 9 February to address electors, but the short notice and the fact that farmers were engaged in field work meant that no meeting could be arranged. In the evening a meeting was arranged at Hamilton and about 20 electors attended.</p>
<p>14 February 1865, page 3</p>
<p>J. Rounsevell writes from Kapunda 13 February.</p>
<p>[He is responding to a recent paragraph in the Register stating that great inconvenience had been caused by the stopping of the Blinman [mail] cart.]</p>
<p>I have not run a cart there for some years, but continue to run an American wagon. I now find it impossible to run quite up to the Mine because of the deplorable state of the north this season. Not only the mail horses, but the stock on the runs are dying by thousands and I cannot carry the mail with horses, but carry it on foot above the Blinman. Many stations are having to distribute their rations on foot and overseers themselves are driving wheelbarrows with loads as far as six miles out at a time.</p>
<p>The anti-squatters should see the country before talking and writing so much and they would then have a better idea of what the squatters should pay. Not one of them would take nine out of ten of the runs in the north at cost price, without rent. Should we get some rain and feed the mail conveyance will run again – if needed – but now everyone who can has left and travelling is at an end except on foot with a canteen on your back. If we get another season like this the north will be deserted.</p>

On Monday amidst wind and clouds of dust a goodly number of people assembled in the schoolroom for a tea meeting and the public meeting followed at 7 p.m. in the church. There was a proposal to aim to pay off £1,000 of the debt on the chapel within two years. This would leave only £200 owing. Promises of nearly £400 were received and if a further £400 can be raised in the next two years the District Meeting has engaged to make up the £1,000 by giving £200 out of its funds.</p>

<p>Professor Bushell gave one of his instructive electro-biological lectures in the hall at the Burra Hotel last night. The audience was not very numerous nor very quiet – just sufficiently noisy to distract the Professor. He nevertheless succeeded in getting one young man under his influence and showed how complete was his mastery over him. Professor Belew submitted to being tied twice to the chair by two different men each time and in 21⁄2 minutes was free the first time and in 2 minutes the second time. Today he will give a lecture on horse-taming.</p>

<p>A sample of ore from Wandillah has been brought in and averages 241⁄4% copper. It is mainly brown carbonate of iron and copper, similar to the Burra Burra Mine, with a slight sprinkling of yellow ore. Four or five pits have been dug and there is copper found in each. It is known as Patterson’s Mine, but there are several connected with it.</p>
<p>At the Burra Creek Mine work is still going on and some good stones of oxide and carbonates have been found.</p>

<p>AS Mining Association [Editorial]</p>
<p>The 20th Annual Report of the SA Mining Association.</p>
<p>The Directors began with a complaint about the state of the copper market. (The February news from England shows the price continuing to decline.)</p>
<p>From their last report the Directors note a further depression of the copper price by £6 to £9 per ton. The latest price at the time of writing the report was £96 per ton. This seriously affects the profitability of working the Mine.</p>
<p>No dividend is declared in the present report, though there is the prospect of one when the copper and ore on hand are disposed of, as the sale of these at current prices will swell the profit account to £12,695, which would pay the usual dividend and leave a small balance in hand. At present the amount of undivided profit is £8,755.</p>
<p>For the six months to 30 September 1864, 3,773 tons of ore were raised at an outlay of £34,631-12-11 or £9-3-7 per ton. This realised £47,409-13-6 or £12-11-4 per ton, leaving a profit of £12,778-0-7 or £3-7-9 per ton. This profit has been increased by £800 from rents and £5-17-6 from fees, to a total from all sources of £13,583-18-1. Out of this the 55th dividend amounting to £12,320 was paid on 3 December.</p>
<p>The Captain’s report is favourable. There are a great number ‘of unworked pitches on hand which would be worthy of miners’ attention if they were to call that way.’</p>
<p>Ore is still being raised at Karkulto, but none has been sampled in the last 9 weeks.</p>

<p>Good Friday was kept as a strict holiday with every place of business closed. Carts were much in demand to take people to their various recreations. One party went kangaroo hunting and killed no fewer than 48.</p>
<p>At the Church of England the usual services were held morning and evening, though the latter was thinly attended.</p>
<p>A shower of rain on Saturday night settled the dust.</p>
<p>Easter Monday was also a holiday. Some amused themselves at cricket and others went to the races at Cross Roads.</p>
<p>The Church Sunday-school children had their abundance of fruit in the Burra Grammar School, which was filled to overflowing with children till dark.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary on the same day. After meeting at the Chapel grounds they marched with flying banners to Limestone Hill for fruit and games and in the afternoon tea and cakes at the schoolroom. A public meeting was held in the evening. Despite serious losses of pupils and teachers to Wallaroo, the state of the school was satisfactory. Rev. W. North the new minister spoke, hoping parents would sometimes visit the school.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a vestry meeting was held at St Mary’s Church to elect church officers for the coming year.</p>

<p>Mr J. Hancock the Bible Christian minister preached his farewell service on Sunday evening 9 April to a crowded congregation. On 14 April there was a tea meeting in the schoolroom when about 250 partook of the good things provided and a public meeting followed at which Mr T. Richards presided. Mr R. Boundy read and presented a highly complimentary address and also made a presentation of several religious books and a purse containing a small sum of money. Mr Hancock responded at length. Mr Allen, the newly appointed minister, also addressed the meeting.</p>

<p>‘Z.Y.X.’ writes 24 April:</p>
<p>A few days ago I passed by a sheep station not 40 miles from Burra. Sheep were dying of starvation in all directions and bodies lay all around. The ewes were lambing at the rate of 60 in 24 hours. Of the 50 I personally saw I noted only 6 take to their lambs. The others went off without looking or caring. Many of the ewes die in lambing or soon after. The state of the land can be imagined from there being no rain since November 1863 to do any good. I don’t see any lambs being saved; the ewes will have as much as they can do to save themselves. I say all this because I have heard some persons remark a short time ago that reports of the runs on the Eastern Plains being hard up for feed were all bosh.</p>

<p>Henry Dawson writes from Gumeracha, 30 April:</p>
<p>Roads will shortly be the great subject of debate both inside and outside Parliament. We landowners from Marrabel up by Steelton and the Head of the Light need to take every legitimate means of bringing this middle line of road to the attention of the Central Road Board and the Government. It is the shortest route to Burra with the best gradients and is inhabited on both sides for miles by farmers. Now is the time to be up and doing.</p>

<p>We have been visited by some rain; steady, but not copious. We hear they have had rain beyond Kanyaka.</p>
<p>Rev. Stanton’s income has been lamentably deficient; being not half the amount held out to him in England as an inducement to come here. At a vestry meeting last Thursday a resolution establishing the weekly offertory was carried with the object of supplementing Mr Stanton’s income.</p>
<p>A party visited a new mining claim on the Booborowie Run last week. They reported favourably. I believe it consists of some old workings begun by Dr Browne some considerable time ago and abandoned.</p>

<p>We learn by private advice from England that Mr J.B.

<p>Road to Kooringa</p>
<p>A public meeting was held at Burra Hotel on Friday evening 26 May to consider petitioning the Central Road Board to adopt the present line of road through Apoinga and Logan’s Gap in place of the proposed road known as the middle road. 80 to 100 attended with W.H. Challoner in the chair.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner outlined the purpose of the meeting and said the change proposed would be detrimental to all. The memorial had been in circulation for one day and had already 500 signatures.</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat proposed that the memorial be adopted. Thomas S. Porter seconded.</p>
<p>Mr Hansell spoke in support: in the early days when the country was open the teamsters had the choice of route and chose the present line of road as best. It had a good foundation and 11 waterholes (not the 8 stated in the memorial). The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr William Pearce moved a motion that the inhabitants of Kooringa would suffer a great injustice by the proposed change. The proposal would shift the road two miles away from Kooringa and inhabitants who had expended great sums of money on their properties would lose as the traffic went away from the town. Also it would be difficult to go over Porter’s Hill on the middle road. The road would have to be made all the way from Springbank. Mr Moody seconded and Mr Williams spoke in support. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr John Kent proposed the memorial be sent to the Board immediately. This too was carried.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening a meeting was held at the Burra Hotel to present a testimonial to Mr Winnall for services as Superintendent of St Mary’s Sunday School for the past six or seven years and for his work in keeping the congregation together in the interregnum between ministers that preceded the arrival of the present incumbent. He was presented with a silver salver suitable inscribed. It was presented by Rev. Stanton in a speech of considerable length and feeling.</p>

<p>Presentation at Kooringa</p>
<p>A meeting of members of St Mary’s Church took place on Thursday 1 June at the Burra Hotel to present Mr John Winnall with a silver plate on the occasion of his resigning as churchwarden. Rev. L.W. Stanton presided and after a brief speech in which he spoke highly of Mr Winnall’s services, he presented the piece of plate in the name of the congregation. The inscription reads:</p>
<p>‘Presented by the congregation of St Mary’s Church, Kooringa, to John Winnall, in recognition of his services as Churchwarden and occasional lay reader during a period of six years. April 17 1865.’</p>
<p>Mr Winnall briefly responded.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner added his words of appreciation of Mr Winnall’s contribution to the parish. A vote of thanks was passed to Dr Maurau for choosing the plate and one to Mr T. Bath for his efforts on collecting the subscription.</p>

<p>Accident. As Rev. Stanton was leaving St Mary’s Church today the wheel of his carriage caught the corner of the bridge fence on the road. Mr Stanton was thrown out with great violence and the shafts and traces were broken. Mr Stanton lay unconscious for more than fifteen minutes and serious fears were held for his safety.</p>
<p>Dr Peel attended and the victim recovered, though it was several hours before he could be taken home. He is badly bruised and the extent of his injuries will not be certain for some time. One report speaks of a broken arm.</p>
<p>No other members of the family who were with him were injured, though the children were frightened.</p>

<p>Central Road Board</p>
<p>W.H. Challoner wrote on behalf of a meeting at Kooringa and transmitted a copy of a resolution passed to the effect that it would be a gross injustice to the people of Kooringa to alter the present line of road after they had laid out large sums on the faith of its continuing as the main line.</p>
<p>A memorial from 489 residents was received opposing the petition sent in favour of the middle line of road being adopted as the Main North Road and advocating the line adjacent to the present road from Springfield, through Apoinga by Logan’s Gap to Sod Hut Ranges and into Kooringa.</p>
<p>[Springfield was about one mile north of Marrabel.]</p>
<p>Mr Macaulay reported on six possible lines of road:</p>
<p>Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Logan’s Gap-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen. 35 miles.</p>
<p>Springfield-Steelton-Long Hill-Springbank-Bon Accord-Aberdeen. 32 miles.</p>
<p>Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Near Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Bon Accord-Aberdeen. 32 miles 33 chains.</p>
<p>Springfield-Tothill’s Creek-Apoinga-Near Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen. 34 miles 42 chains.</p>
<p>Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Long Hill-Springbank-Aberdeen. 32 miles 42 chains.</p>
<p>Springfield-Steelton-Black Springs-Karkulto Mine-Langmead’s-Sod Hut Ranges-Kooringa-Aberdeen. 33 miles 65 chains.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>2 is the shortest, but with two steep gradients (one of 1:14 for 19 chains and one of 1:22 for 65 chains) and it leaves Kooringa off the main road.</p>
<p>5 is the next shortest, but has the same objections as No. 2 except for taking in Black Springs.</p>
<p>3 is the next shortest, but with the same objections and it leaves Black Springs to the west.</p>
<p>6 avoids Long Hill and passes through both Black Springs and Kooringa.</p>
<p>1 &amp; 4 are almost the same length. 1 has been the road usually used as the main road and c. 23⁄4 miles is already metalled with side ditches for drainage from Springfield to Apoinga.</p>
<p>The old road is best for water and the middle or western road takes in the largest amount of agricultural land.</p>
<p>The plans were presented.</p>
<p>The matter was then adjourned to the next meeting.</p>

[To which must be added student fees to obtain their annual incomes. More details are given, but none relate to specifically Burra.]</p>
<p>9 June 1865, page 3</p>
<p>A Public Meeting at Steelton was held in the schoolroom on 6 June. Mr J.B. Miller presided.</p>
<p>He spoke in favour of the middle road as passing through the best agricultural land – lying 12 miles west of the Tothill’s creek Road. The middle road was also straight for 13 miles beyond Springfield and there was a good natural road without a bridge, ford or other obstruction.</p>
<p>The claim of Burra memorialists that there is no water on the middle road is wrong; there are 12 Government reserves with permanent water.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner had said at the Burra meeting that the removal of the present road would be detrimental to all. It might be detrimental to the Company he was interested in, but to move it to the centre of a widely populated and cultivated district would not be detrimental to any except a company of mine shareholders and speculative landowners. The present road was undoubtedly of interest to the Copper Company, but not to the inhabitants of the populated agricultural district to the west of the present road.</p>
<p>A letter refuting certain statements in the Burra memorial will be sent to the Central Road Board.</p>

<p>Accident. John Killicoat had a fortunate escape from harm recently. He was on his horse and had just received his gun to shoot crows. In holding it by the stock he did not notice that the key which fastens the stock and barrel together was not in its proper place. As a consequence the barrel fell and went off. The contents lodged in the bowels of the horse about eight or nine inches behind the rider’s foot. The valuable horse had to be put down.</p>
<p>Rev. Stanton has resumed duties after his accident.</p>

<p>The Main Road to the North</p>
<p>Henry Dawson writes from Gumeracha, 13 June, commenting on the Central Road Board’s deliberations:</p>
<p>No 1 road seems to have a very poor claim. It is the longest and does not run through agricultural land. Are present and coming generations to be punished because of what was done on a bush road to meet demands in a then unsettled part of the country? The middle line serves tens of thousands of acres of agricultural land on both sides and are the settlers there to be denied in order to benefit a mine that if it is working today might stop tomorrow?</p>

<p>Saddleworth News, 21 June</p>
<p>A large meeting was held at Stuart’s Hotel Saddleworth on Monday 19 June to consider the urgent necessity of petitioning Parliament to place the road through this constantly growing district on the schedule of main roads. It was moved that the road from Forrester’s via Riverton, Saddleworth and Chinkford to Black Springs should be placed on the schedule of main lines of road.</p>
<p>[The major argument was the centrality of the road to a large and growing agricultural area presently badly served by roads.]</p>

<p>Steelton News</p>
<p>A public meeting held in the Steelton schoolroom on 17 June considered the report of Mr Macaulay on the lines of road for the Main North Road. William Mahood presided. He said at the Board meeting Mr McEwin, &amp; Mr Hallett had said the old road was the best. But on what basis? It could not be desirable to have a main road run between two ranges of hills with a breadth of only about two miles of agricultural land. On the east range there was no gap or available road for 14 miles and on the west one gap in 15 miles. Mr Mahood thought the two gentlemen should not have formed premature opinions.</p>
<p>Mr Miller said the No. 6 road was the most advantageous. It was shorter than No. 1 and No. 6 (or the middle road) from Springfield to Black Springs and Kooringa would meet both the prayers of the Kooringa memorialists and the farmers of the Steelton neighbourhood and perhaps gratify everyone except the Copper Co. Advocates of the middle road should commend the No. 6 route.</p>
<p>Mr Macaulay is wrong in assessing the old road as best for water. [The middle road] has 9 Government reserves with constant water on or near the line of road.</p>
<p>Mr Davison said the middle line of road had only its own merits to recommend it and not any influential company interest to back it. The middle road as represented by the No. 6 route in Mr Macaulay’s report was the right road.</p>
<p>A letter expressing these views will be sent to the Central Road Board signed by the chairman.</p>
<p>The Steelton Hotel is progressing fast and should be finished in a fortnight. It will be a great accommodation for travellers as present there is no [public] house of the kind between Springfield and Black Springs on this road.</p>

<p>J.G. Daly for the Tothill’s Creek Road:</p>
<p>The distance was less</p>
<p>The quality of the materials available en route was better</p>
<p>Water was abundant all along the line</p>
<p>Settlers had laid out a lot of money with the supposition it would remain the main line</p>
<p>A great deal of land would be opened up on the east side of that line of road</p>
<p>Mr S. Dawson for the middle road:</p>
<p>The distance was less</p>
<p>More agricultural land would be opened up</p>
<p>The supply of both materials and water on the route was as good as on the Tothill’s Creek line.</p>
<p>He said he favoured route 6.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on 28 July before Mr McDermott SM on the body of Hugh Parker. Mr Hutson was elected foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Hugh Parker:</p>
<p>Am father of the deceased boy and a shepherd on Robert Stevens run, Burra Creek. Saw the boy alive on the morning of 25 July. Came with him for two miles. He was in good health. There was a strong shower and we sat down. When it was over he went away with his flock. Did not see him alive again. He was aged 14. He was on level country with no trees for shelter. The weather was very rough and it rained heavily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The night was cloudy. He usually came home about 6 or 7 o’clock, but was not coming home that night because he was going to Mr Steven’s to take another flock. Deceased was wearing moleskin trousers, leggings and a kangaroo skin coat. The leggings were found 100 yards from the body. The body was about three quarters of a mile from where I left him. There was no hut or house within three miles.</p>
<p>George Parker:</p>
<p>[Brother of the deceased. Much of his evidence confirmed his father’s account.]</p>
<p>Discovered deceased lying on his back near two trees, not sufficient to provide shelter. When found the weather was stormy and raining heavily.</p>
<p>Dr Peel: Examined the body. There were no marks on the body except a simple bruise on the thigh, probably caused when he fell over. There is nothing to account for the death except the inclemency of the weather.</p>
<p>That was also the conclusion of the jury.</p>
<p>[Hugh Parker born 29 August 1851, Gawler Town: died 27 July 1865, Burra Creek.]</p>
<p>Central Road Board</p>
<p>The Board decided to hear a deputation from Mr H. Dawson &amp; Messrs Jones &amp; Murphy concerning the road to Burra. Mr Jones said he had been requested by a public meeting at Black Springs to urge the advantages of the middle road. Apart from arguments about opening up agricultural land, teamsters from the northwest invariably made use of the middle road when carting wool to Kapunda. Sheep farmers, commercial travellers and others preferred the middle road. Vested interests in the old road must give way to the public good.</p>
<p>Mr Murphy of Steelton made a similar case.</p>
<p>Mr H. Dawson called attention to the water supply along the middle road.</p>
<p>Mr Everard then proposed the middle road or the No. 6 line be adopted.</p>
<p>Mr Kelly seconded this and Mr McEwin supported the proposal as did Mr Sutherland. Mr Hallett said his first inclination had been to support the original road via Apoinga, but after consideration and given that neither line of road had been defined, he now supported the middle road. The Chairman agreed and so the proposal was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>Parliament had voted £5,000 for the road from Springfield to Black Springs and the surveyor was instructed to proceed.</p>

<p>The Old North Road</p>
<p>A meeting at Templers, North Star Inn Saturday 23 July was called to discuss delays to the formation of the Old North Road. Not only was work not progressing much, the work already done would not stand winter traffic. The North District was unfairly treated. After 27 years of the colony there North District did not have 27 miles of serviceable road. The meeting called for Parliament to grant £30,000 for the completion of the Old North Road from Gawler past Templers.</p>

<p>The Wesleyan Minister Rev. W.S. Worth paid visits to stations in the Northeast. On Tuesday 9 August he was at Mr Hiles’ Mungibbie [a.k.a. Munjibbie] Station. Mr Hiles made ample provision for his guests and though 35 miles from Burra 80 to 90 people sat down to tea. Afterwards Mr Alexander McCulloch presided and Rev. Worth gave his lecture on George Stephenson as previously arranged. The Kooringa Wesleyan Choir added their services and brought a harmonium with them. At the close Mr Worth stated the financial position of the circuit. He said that although the usual expenses of the circuit were met by income, there was at present a £65 debt due to the recent change of ministers and other factors. A collection was made and the sum of £50 was given or promised. (£17-2-6 was collected.) The tea meeting was deemed one of the most pleasant evenings those present had ever spent.</p>

<p>A public meeting was held in the schoolroom on 12 August to receive the report of the trustees of Steelton School on the completion of the work. The total amount received was £146-19-9, to which is added the grant from the Board [of Education] of £127-10-0 for a total of £274-9-9. The total amount expended was £271-13-3. It was also represented that the master’s residence was in great need of repair and enlargement. Mr H.M. Parkin was instructed to prepare a plan and estimates and they will be forwarded to the Board of Education with a view to obtaining a grant. The meeting also endorsed the recent decision of the Central Road Board in favour of the middle road becoming the Main North Road.</p>

<p>Mr Rounsevell’s Central Establishment</p>
<p>[This is quite a long and detailed article of which the following is but a selection of key facts.]</p>
<p>Few are aware of the extent of Mr Rounsevell’s establishment or the amount of capital employed in his wide ranging operations. Not many years ago few people travelled into the interior except missionary preachers, mailmen, commercial travellers, policemen and stockmen and all travelled on horseback. Wheeled vehicle were out of the question except in the most favourable seasons of the year and even then much time was lost on waiting for repairs. Outlying farmers were compelled to make visits to the city more often than was convenient, but visits by the females of their families were short and widely spaced.</p>
<p>Now the Central Road Board has slowly extended carriage tracks in various directions from the city. In other cases rapidly expanding commerce has seen the development of other roads, perhaps neither as splendid nor as safe as might be desired.</p>
<p>Mr Rounsevell is an old colonist who early in his career worked hard and turned his earnings to good account.</p>
<p>The town establishment is situated in Pirie Street, but extends through to, and has and entrance also on Grenfell Street. It extends over 11⁄2 acres with stables, coach sheds, smithies, coach builders and harness makers’ shops. The buildings have little architectural beauty, having been erected piecemeal as required. There are three sections: the carriage business, the conveyance of mail and the Bay Road and orders.</p>
<p>The business employs 200 horses and the stables have room for nearly 50 horses. Mr Rounsevell grows upon his own farm a large proportion of the consumption of this Adelaide establishment. The workshops are needed to cope with the wear and tear of 1,744 miles per day.</p>
<p>[The article continues by discussing some of the variety of works done on the premises and also discusses the wide range of vehicles kept. Rounsevell provided a great variety of vehicles for special occasions as well as the mail conveyances and coaches etc. used in country travel. He had for hire such things as hearses and mourning coaches, wedding carriages, light gigs and unwieldy omnibuses.]</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on 7 September before W.H. Challoner JP on the body of Carl Wimmer, found drowned in the Burra Mine on 6 September. James Pearce was foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Henry Renton, miner:</p>
<p>Left the deceased at quarter past 12 a.m. on 6 September at the strakes [a sluice for washing ore] at his work and went to dinner. Came back at 1 o’clock and saw the deceased in the mud and water. Got him up and called Bodminer, as I thought him to be dead. Had worked near him for two years. Deceased was subject to fits many times. He fell into the water 15 months earlier in the same manner. Had not seen him have a fit in the last six or seven weeks. There was 8 to 9 inches of water and sand in the place.</p>
<p>John Bodminer, miner, corroborated this evidence and said the doctor was sent for and tried to revive deceased.</p>
<p>Thomas Wilson Corlyn, medical practitioner:</p>
<p>Was sent for and found deceased lying on the floor of the blacksmith’s shop, apparently dead. Administered artificial respiration for about 50 minutes. Supposed he died from drowning (asphyxia). Note a mark on his chest, perhaps from falling on a plank.</p>
<p>The jury concluded the deceased was found drowned while in an apoplectic fit, to which he had been subject.</p>

<p>Notice</p>
<p>The SA Mining Association will hold its half-yearly meeting of shareholders at the office of the Association in Imperial Chambers, King William street, Adelaide on Wednesday 18 October, to receive the Directors’ Report, to examine the Auditors’ Report and to consider a proposition for reconstructing the Association with a view to the thorough development of the Mines.</p>
<p>Secretary, Henry Ayers, 3 October 1865.</p>
<p>17 October 1865, page 2</p>
<p>The SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The Directors will submit an important question to the shareholders next Wednesday. They believe the Association should be dissolved and a new company established with a capital of £300,000 in 60,000 shares of £5 each. Into this company it is proposed to take present shareholders who are to have the first offer of new shares.</p>
<p>But since this proposition was put in writing the Directors have received an offer from Messrs Beck, Elder, Graham, Stirling and McLaren, who are now in England, to purchase the property outright for £150,000 and to raise fresh capital by the issue of new shares.</p>
<p>They say the object of the new company will be to remodel the undertaking by exploring the mine more fully, adopting the most approved dressing and other machinery and endeavouring to turn the creek ores to profit.</p>
<p>If necessary for the carrying out of these objectives capital will be increased by the issue of new shares. They say that from 30 September next under this proposal the property would be managed and worked by the present management in the usual manner, but at their risk as regards profit and loss.</p>
<p>Which scheme the shareholders will adopt is to be considered at the next meeting.</p>
<p>19 October 1865, page 2</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The half-yearly meeting of shareholders was held with the Hon. G.S. Kingston presiding.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by 40 shareholders who represented nearly 2,000 shares. Two propositions were put to the shareholders for consideration. The Directors put forward one and some gentlemen in London had a proposal to organise a new company, admitting old shareholders not desirous of retiring from the Association, on terms laid before the meeting. The decision was to proceed with the further development of the Mine and to communicate with the promoters in England with a view to obtaining an increase in the amount of purchase money offered.</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held in their office on Wednesday 18October. There was a very large attendance of shareholders including the Directors and Secretary (Hon. Henry Ayers), numbering 40 persons representing 112 shareholders, holding 1929 shares. The Hon. G.S. Kingston presided.</p>
<p>The reports, having been circulated were taken as read. The reports were received.</p>
<p>The next matter for consideration was the portion of the report embracing the two proposals for the reconstruction of the Association. Since the Directors had put forward their proposition they had received from England a letter containing an alternative proposition, which in their opinion was better than the one they had furnished.</p>
<p>Mr Glyde MP asked whether a rough estimate had been made of the value of the buildings etc. erected by the [Kooringa] tenants. The Chairman said this had not been done and Mr Glyde said he thought it desirable.</p>
<p>The Chairman said that as he viewed the matter it would make no difference that would interfere with the proper consideration of the subject before them.</p>
<p>Mr Glyde said he gathered from conversation with others that there was some confusion with respect to the object in view. Were they to understand that those shareholders who did not wish to continue in the company would be bought out at £61 per share? The Chairman said that was correct.</p>
<p>The secretary said that under the scheme in the London offer there would be no additional liability to be incurred and that the offer to any person wishing to retire from the Association the offer was as had been stated. A question had arisen whether a shareholder contributing in the colony would be entitled to the same privileges as those subscribing in London. Letters from Mr Beck and Mr Graham had both indicated that shareholders would all be on the same footing.</p>
<p>The matter had been taken up in London because the shareholders there were on the same footing as themselves. For the last six months although they had 6,000 tons of copper ore the Association was estimated to lose £3,000 in operations. The Directors thought therefore the time had come when another course should be pursued. They thought it would be unwise to allow the men employed on the Mine to go elsewhere, but it was more to the interest of the company that the men should be kept on during these times of low copper prices and an endeavour made to develop the portions of the Mine that would yield ores until the price rose to its former position.</p>
<p>The ore discovered in the shallow levels incurred great expense in dressing. When raised it did not yield more than 4 or 5%, but with rather expensive dressing might be made to yield up to 22%. If they continued in this way in exhausting the old pitches in a few years they would be left with an empty shell.</p>
<p>Mr Stead asked whether the Mine would be developed without going to the additional expense of purchasing machinery. The Secretary said further development would require extra outlay. They had the machinery, but would have to erect it and would have to sink a new shaft and communicate it to Morphett’s Shaft.</p>
<p>Mr Samuel Tomkinson said that after the explanation given by the Secretary it was clear that it would have been advantageous if operations had ceased for the past 12 months because apparently they had been raising ore and giving it away. He was therefore pleased to receive the original plan proposed by the Directors.</p>
<p>The difference with the proposal from London was that it allowed an opportunity for shareholders who wished it, of retiring from the Association. He thought the sum of £150,000 was too low, taking the Mine together with the great quantity of valuable land in connection with it. While it was true the value of the Mine might diminish, nevertheless, £350,477 was not a very large amount if it was a mine at all. He believed the Karkulto property would permit of development in its present state. He thought the shareholders needed time to think it over and to communicate with those whom they represented. This would also allow time for communication with London – say four or five months – to see whether the London promoters would raise their offer to something like a proper amount.</p>
<p>Mr Blyth MP sought clarification. He understood the London promoters undertook to provide a sum of £70,000 with the view to the formation of a new company. It was fair to assume then, that under the arrangement proposed the new company expected to realise some degree of profit over and above that which the development of the mine would afford and that they would secure additional profit by putting in the London market so valuable a property as these mines, the reputation of which had become a matter of notoriety.</p>
<p>Was it intended that the profit so arising should be divided among the shareholders who joined the new scheme. As to the offer of £61 per share for those desirous of retiring from the Association, he thought that by waiting a few months they might get a good deal more than £61 per share.</p>
<p>The Chairman said there was no question that the profits would be divided equally.</p>
<p>Hon. W. Peacock said it must be so or he, as the largest shareholder in the colony, would not consent to the plan. The Secretary agreed that he was quite sure all shareholders were to be treated equally.</p>
<p>It was resolved that the Directors proceed with the development of the Mine as suggested in the proposition of the Association of 2 October 1865.</p>
<p>Mr Glyde said the price of shares last week was £65, but that had decreased as a consequence of the offer.</p>
<p>Mr Peacock said the London proposal was better for those desirous of retiring from the Association.</p>
<p>Mr Thomas Graves thought it would be an advantage to have gentlemen at home [i.e. in England] to look after the interests of the company.</p>
<p>The Chairman thought it was the intention of the gentlemen in England to issue for every £60 share four of £20 each. The secretary said it was believed £20 shares would be more suitable for the London Market.</p>
<p>It was resolved that the Directors would communicate with the London gentlemen with a view to their increasing the amount of the offer and that a draft prospectus of the intended new company be transmitted to Adelaide. In the meantime the representatives of absentee shareholders would consult their principals.</p>

<p>Central Road Board: The Road to Burra</p>
<p>A memorial signed by 122 inhabitants of the various Burra townships prayed that the Board appropriate £5,000 or a portion of such amount voted by the Legislature for the Burra Road, for use on that portion of the road between Langmead’s and Kooringa. This was the worst portion and in fact impassable. The memorial noted that 15 months ago the Board voted £650 for making a portion of road at the Sod Hut Ranges, but such sum had not yet been expended. Two other petitions on this matter were also received. The Board directed that the works be pushed forward as speedily as possible.</p>
<p>23 November 1865, page 3</p>
<p>‘D’ writes concerning the Burra Mine:</p>
<p>The proposed changes to the constitution of the SA Mining Association might seem to be of concern only to its shareholders, but the business of the company has spread itself all over the colony and has given colonists generally an interest in the proceedings of the company. To speculate upon the consequences of transferring the property of the Burra Mine to an English company may seem premature, but there are dangers in such a proposal, which could affect all the copper mining companies in Australia.</p>
<p>In Britain there is a gigantic monopoly of the smelting trade and if they could gain control of this property, which has been one of the richest in the world, and then strike an arrangement with the principal proprietors of the Burra and Wallaroo Smelting Works it is doubtful if anything like a permanent development of its treasures would be attempted. It would be worked or kept idle as best suited their interests and the loss of trade to the colony would be immense.</p>
<p>The suggestion which the report of the Directors makes to place the new scheme into the English Market and to have the company registered there is not calculated to limit these dangers as outlined.</p>
<p>The arrangement must give the Wallaroo mining and smelting company a monopoly of the Indian and Eastern markets to the practical exclusion of the smaller properties unless through them. The erection of the large smelting works on Yorke’s Peninsula was intended as a protection against the smelting monopoly in England.</p>
<p>If the owners of these works can by amalgamating their interests with the English smelting monopoly and add to their large possession the Burra Mine, the Australian copper trade will be at their mercy.</p>
<p>‘Out of the enormous dividends the mine has returned, common prudence would have made a reserve fund sufficient to carry the concern over a loss such as the Directors show, even if it were repeated for a few years in succession.’</p>

<p>‘One of the Public’</p>
<p>[This letter is in response to a letter of complaint by Rev. Cox. The writer condemns the ‘dangerous and uncomfortable’ vehicles Mr Rounsevell has at different times placed on the Angaston mail route.]</p>
<p>At times the condition of his vehicles has prompted someone else to place rival vehicles that are more commodious and comfortable on the route. On such occasions Mr Rounsevell has promptly cut his fares or schemed in such a way that his rival has been removed. He then resumes his reign of terror ‘with rickety traps, cushionless seats, and often uncivil drivers’.</p>
<p>[The writer goes on to say that public deserve better and the Government should see that vehicles are licensed and a public inspector of such vehicles should enforce the standards required of those licensed vehicles.]</p>
<p>2 December 1865, page 2</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>In the last few days we have had complaints from Rev. Cox and from a writer from Angaston about the standard of public conveyances in the country.</p>
<p>Mr Rounsevell has replied in plain terms. He speaks of Mr Cox’s attacks as ‘shameful’ and ‘untruthful’ and takes the position of a persecuted innocent – attacking Rev. Cox and asking in ‘a style more vigorous than polite’: ‘Why did Mr Cox get into and overload, and try to break down the conveyance, when he was told there was not room for him, but insisted on incommoding the usual passengers, annoying the driver, damaging the vehicle, injuring the business, and insulting the owners, and putting false statements to the papers? What does he mean by it?’</p>
<p>We have a word or two to say to Mr Rounsevell.</p>
<p>He is the great conveyance king among us. There are but few persons in the colony who are not at some time obliged to be placed at his mercy. Given the state of the roads over which his coaches travel perhaps we cannot seek any great degree of comfort, but we ought to have the assurance of safety and a covered coach should keep out the rain. A person who has acquired a monopoly cannot say ‘You are not obliged to go by my vehicles; if you don’t like them you need not use them.’</p>
<p>Having driven all other conveyances off the road, he is bound to pay regard to the interests, safety, and, as far as possible, the convenience of the public. This is recognised in for example the railways of England and the legislators there guard the rights of travellers, and so it ought to be here. It would help if inspectors of vehicles were appointed in all towns from which conveyances start. Such inspection is provided in the city. We mention Mr Rounsevell by name as he is the most extensive of all coach proprietors in the colony, but the remarks would apply to all who keep carriages for hire. Some sort of supervision is needed.</p>
<p>It would be wiser in Mr Rounsevell to accept a hint from those travellers who have found his arrangements defective, and to remove the evil rather than resent it.</p>
<p>[The editor goes on at considerably greater length.]</p>

<p>‘Bushman’ writes 11 December:</p>
<p>I am surprised that ‘C.W.D.’ cannot get shepherds for 18/- a week plus board and lodging and says 20/- is being demanded.</p>
<p>Many have been thrown out of work by the drought in the north. And in this locality at least shepherds can easily be obtained for 15/- a week, their rations being cooked for them.</p>
<p>Perhaps C.W.D. is referring not to shepherds, but to ‘hutters’. A hutter takes charge of a flock of sheep day and night, living by himself, cooking for himself and in fact existing like a hermit, seldom seeing any of his race or colour. His hut will be basic and every item of his rations must be paid for and frequently at high prices. ‘Luxuries’ like butter, milk or vegetables are usually unobtainable. It is small wonder such men would expect 20/- a week. The difference between 18/- and 20/- a week may not be significant to C.W.D., but is not a trifle to the poor working man. Masters who treat their ‘hands’ as if they belonged to the same great human family as themselves rarely have difficulty in procuring servants.</p>
<p>19 December 1865, page 3</p>
<p>Rent, Drought &amp; Squatters’ Profits</p>
<p>‘X.Y.Z.’ writes from Ketchowla, 1 December</p>
<p>This run is assessed to carry 21,600 sheep and the rent and assessment is £354-13-4. For the best season we have seen it carried 11,500 sheep.</p>
<p>The 1864 lambing was a fair one and 15,200 sheep of all descriptions passed through the shearing shed and then the number was immediately reduced to 12,000 – what I consider to be the carrying capacity. From 1 September 1864 to 1 September 1865 1,850 sheep died or were killed by wild dogs and with what we used for rations the number was about 10,000 at the 1865 shearing.</p>
<p>Immediately after the shearing the number was reduced to 4,650.</p>
<p>From 1 September 1865 to 1 November 1865 another 780 died, so the total loss 1 September 1864 to 1 November 1865 was 2,630 besides the whole of the year’s increase. Despite the low numbers left deaths are continuing at about 20 per week as this hot dry weather continues.</p>
<p>Averaging the sheep numbers from September 1863 to September 1865 the rent for each sheep is nearly 7d p.a. and the sheep will yield 31⁄2 lb of wool at 71⁄2d per lb. The rent is thus about 30%.</p>
<p>But with only 4,300 sheep left at present the rent is about 1/8 per sheep – equal to the entire income from wool after paying shearing expenses. In fact in seasons like this the expenses of carrying on the station are quite double the value of the wool produced.</p>

<p>Tenders are called for the purchase of sections 27 (164 acres) and 28 (152 acres) and 30 (237 acres in the Hundred of Kingston. On section 30 there is a well with a good supply. Section 28 has a two-roomed house. This is a most desirable property within 7 miles of Kooringa. With the land are sone 400 sheep and 30 lambs which will have to be taken by the purchaser.

<p>The Past Year. Editorial</p>
<p>The year just ended has been marked by a terrible drought in pastoral areas and poor crops in the agricultural areas. Operations at the Great Burra Mine have been brought almost to a standstill and exports declined dramatically. Despite this the colony has weathered the storm and the treasury is in a flourishing state. Customs revenue has risen and land sales brought in more than £500,000. People continue to have faith in the colony. If Burra languishes there is Moonta to take its place. [The editor goes on to discuss Goyder’s characterisation of the land beyond his line and believes there will prove to be great pastoral land in the far northeast. He fears the other colonies are pursuing policies that will do more to attract settlers than SA’s policies.]</p>
<p>In 1865 SA obtained something like a charter of rights in the shape of an Act of the UK Parliament declaring that Colonial Legislators may pass laws for local government without the feat of having them set aside on technical grounds. Education is being well attended to. The colony remains deficient in theatres, art galleries etc. The criminal records are as free as usual from very serious offences. Employment has been plentiful and wages good, although the price of food has been high. Copper prices fell, but rose again by the year’s end. The present crop seems likely to give a fair yield.</p>

<p>‘A Subscriber’ writes from Kooringa 9 February:</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Kooringa, Redruth and Aberdeen etc. are anxious to know when the long-talked-of road through the Sod Hut Ranges will be made passable, lest next winter they be cut off from the ports. Why has this road not long ago been defined or even gazetted? Burra Mines have been active for 20 years and the road to Kooringa is not yet defined. Compare this with the splendid road to Callington Mines. People prefer to travel via Clare if possible.</p>

<p>‘A Lover of Fair Play’ writes from Redruth 2 March:</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the North are much pleased to see that the long neglect of the road through the Sod Hut Ranges has received the attention of the Rt Hon. H. Ayers. They hope other Hon. Members will follow up this matter.</p>

<p>On Sunday 18 March Rev. W.S. Worth Wesleyan minister for Kooringa referred to the death of the late Rev. D.J. Draper.</p>
<p>Obituary. A miner named S. Noel has lately been working at Moonta and was injured there by a stone falling on his arm. He was compelled by the injury to cease work and return disabled to his wife and family. The wound worsened and when mortification set in he died quite suddenly leaving a wife and four children.</p>
<p>[Stephen Noel died 16 March 1866 aged 33 at Kooringa. BISA item suggests he was sometimes known as Knowle.]</p>
<p>There are several cases of typhoid in Kooringa at present. The disease appeared about six weeks ago and there have been two deaths.</p>
<p>The Local Court was packed with interested spectators on Wednesday 21 March when it took a long time to investigate a charge of assault preferred by Mrs Pascoe against her husband, the landlord of the Aberdeen Hotel. The charge arose from domestic differences and was ultimately dismissed.</p>

<p>Obituary. On Saturday 24 March a shepherd of Mr William Dare found the remains of a man about seven miles from Caroona and between there and Ketchowla. He was about 40 years old. The body was much decomposed and the skin had been dried in the sun. He must have been a lunatic because he was wearing only a coat, while a new pair of moleskin trousers and a white shirt with lavender stripes were nearby. No other garments or boots or swag were found. A nearby sandalwood tree had its branches stripped and laid underneath. These had been trampled on and a circular track worn around the tree. He appeared to have been dead eight to ten weeks.</p>
<p>[There is no corresponding death registration.]</p>
<p>Sickness is still prevalent and deaths are unusually numerous. Two died from typhus during the week.</p>
<p>Obituary. One of these deaths was Mrs Treglown aged about 24 and but newly arrived in the colony.</p>

<p>Several people were fined at the Local Court for depasturing cattle on Crown Land without a licence. The penalty was 5/-.</p>
<p>Mr Bright’s imposition of this penalty under the new Act was appreciated as the Act sets no minimum. The old Act imposed a minimum £10 fine for a second offence.</p>
<p>Mr West the teacher at Redruth gave his pupils a half holiday on Tuesday. After a run on the hills they had tea and Mr Godson gave them a suitable address. The school now has 120 children. Mr West deserves his success from the pains he takes.</p>
<p>Weather. It has been oppressively hot for the last few days. A man named William Davey was sunstruck at the Mine and taken home in a cart.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. (Editorial)</p>
<p>The affairs of the SA Mining Association have been so closely identified with the progress of the colony that although it is a private entity its operation claims the attention of all. It affects hundreds of families directly and indirectly. As a result the proposals now being put forward cause people to ask how it comes about that it should be reduced to ‘suffer a recovery’ rather than continue in its prosperous condition.</p>
<p>It appears from the Directors’ report and from the new scheme they are considering that they want to raise about £37,000 to carry on work at the 60 fathom level where there is said to be plenty of copper if they could get at it.</p>
<p>In order to raise the money they propose to dissolve the Company and reorganise it. Although it has been one of the richest associations in the world no reserve fund has been formed to meet an emergency and no adequate provision made to develop the mine as the workings became deeper. The profits were simply distributed as fast as they were obtained. Now the result is that although it still contains riches, the mine has been worked at a loss for want of sufficient means to develop it.</p>
<p>The value of the shares has fallen much below their worth according to the secretary. This is to be expected if the mine is working at a loss and the proprietors were taking no steps to rectify that. Perhaps new shares could have been issued while the mine was still making a profit and while the old shares still stood high in public estimation, but now it is too late to do that.</p>
<p>The proposal is to form a new company to be called the Burra Burra Mining Company Ltd with a capital of £300,000 in 60,000 shares of £5 each fully paid: 42,000 to be issued initially and 18,000 held in reserve if additional capital should be required.</p>
<p>Holders of the 2,464 shares in the SA Mining Association will be allotted 34,496 shares in Burra Burra Mining Co. Ltd fully paid up (equivalent to £172,480). This values one share in the old company at 14 in the new. The remaining 7,504 shares in the Burra Burra Mining co. are to be made available as follows:</p>
<p>Each of the old shareholders have the right to one £5 share in the new company (at par) for each share held in the SA Mining Association – say 2,464 shares.</p>
<p>3,000 are reserved for sale in England.</p>
<p>2040 plus any not claimed by present shareholders are to be offered to the public at par or the best premium obtainable.</p>
<p>This would give the company £37,520 plus an estimated £15,000 profit from unsold copper.</p>
<p>This proposal was approved at a general meeting of shareholders. No profits are therefore presently declared, but the work of exploration will proceed according to the new scheme.</p>
<p>The present report shows that the results to the year ending September last were better than expected due to an increase in the copper price. The sale of two parcels of copper recently arrived in London is now expected to realise £3,000 more than when they were exported. This will more than wipe out the loss on operations for the half year to 31 March 1865. That, and an excess in production over estimates will convert the estimated loss of £2,278-19-1 for that half year to a profit of £3,520-19-1.</p>
<p>In the six months just ended production has not fallen, though the profit per ton is only £1-2-1.</p>
<p>3,174 tons cost £33,112-11-6 or £10-8-8 per ton, valued at £36,633-10-7 or £11-10-10 per ton.</p>
<p>This will yield a profit of £3,520-19-1 or £1-2-2 per ton, which gives a total in the credit of profit and loss account of £7,004-2-2. If the present copper price prevails, copper on hand is expected to realise a further £812-6-10.</p>
<p>The great hope of the mine is in the sinking of a new shaft to the west of the old workings. This would enable deeper workings, take a large portion of water from Morphett’s Engine and allow the extension of workings to the south. As a result Graves’ Engine Shaft is being sunk by nine men and is now eleven fathoms deep, timbered and divided and it is intended to sink as far as the engine will allow – say 140 to 150 fathoms.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association at its AGM in its offices in King William Street on Wednesday considered the report of the Directors, deciding on the adoption of a scheme previously submitted to reorganise the Association. The Hon. G.S. Kingston was called to preside. Hon. H. Ayers read the annual report, which was adopted.</p>
<p>It was, he said, understood that in adopting the report, they approved the suggested scheme.</p>
<p>Messrs Beck, Elder &amp; Co. in England had declined to increase their offer for the mine and negotiations with them had ended.</p>
<p>The non-residential shareholders had indicated a general approval of the proposed scheme, especially if the new shares were £5 fully paid, rather than paid to £3-10-0. The Directors decided to recommend that and that a new company be formed on the lines proposed last October.</p>
<p>[He then outlined the proposal as already noted in the editorial in the paper of the same day.]</p>
<p>The proposal would also leave un-called capital to the amount of £90,000 available whenever circumstances might warrant its being asked for. If the representatives of absent shareholders require to consult their principals before agreeing to the proposition now offered, six months’ notice may be allowed for shareholders to signify their assent or dissent to the arrangement. In the meantime no dividends will be paid, but the works of exploration will continue.</p>
<p>The new company would be registered in England and have a Board of Directors in London for the transfer of shares and to conduct the company’s business in England. The Boards of Directors in Adelaide and in London would be elected by shareholders in the new company. Mr Ayers explained the mode of working at the 60 fathom level, for which the additional £37,000 was needed. He said advice from London was that the non-residential shareholders were willing to co-operate in the proposed reorganisation.</p>
<p>S. Tomkinson moved that the necessary legal steps be taken by the Directors to dissolve the Association and to reorganise it on the basis of the proposal of 18 October 1865, with the changes respecting fully paid up shares as suggested in the Directors’ Report presented this day.</p>
<p>Answering a question, Mr Ayers said that the alternative of issuing new shares in the existing Association was a possibility (with the consent of an extraordinary general meeting), but was unwise and would greatly depress the value of shares, which were already quoted at a figure below their true value. The motion was put and carried.</p>
<p>Mr James Smith said he supported the proposal, but was astonished that the company should collapse for the want of £37,000 after producing such extraordinary wealth.</p>
<p>The Secretary pointed out that while large provision had been made for continuing operations, the shareholders had always been in favour of frequent dividends. The fall in copper prices had also hindered operations. £37,000 could easily have been borrowed, but there was the need to bring the Association under the Limited Liability Act. The five retiring directors: Messrs J. Beck, T.G. Waterhouse, T. Graves, the Hon. A. Blyth and the Hon. G.S. Kingston, were all re-elected.</p>

<p>Bigamy. On Wednesday Mr John Bagg of Springbank sustained a charge of bigamy against his wife. The case aroused much interest as Mr Bagg is an old settler at Burra. Mr Bagg said he met his wife 27 years ago on Kangaroo Island. They had lived together unmarried for five years and she then left him and married a man called William Seymour. After a few weeks she returned to Bagg and lived with him. Fifteen years after their first intimacy Bagg married his wife (in Burra), she having assured him that Seymour was dead. The pair often quarrelled and at times lived apart. Three months after the most recent separation Bagg laid this information. William Seymour, the first husband, was produced in court along with a witness, Mrs Janet Bristow, to his marriage with Mrs Bagg. Mrs Bagg was committed for trial.</p>
<p>A serious assault occurred at the Smelters’ Home last Friday. A man who was partially intoxicated challenged any person to a fight and when no one accepted the challenge he struck Mr D. Quigley without provocation, while the latter was drinking a glass of ale. The latter threw the tumbler he was drinking from at the assailant and it smashed, inflicting a severe wound. As the man provoked the assault the matter was settled out of court.</p>

<p>J.C. of Clare on 2 May writes on the state of the Country.</p>
<p>I was through the Bundaleer Run a few days ago and believe I could carry all the grass away in a bag on my back. Drought and fires have made a wreck of the run. The day I was there 20,000 sheep were turned adrift on the run and the overseer said that unless rain fell soon not one lamb in 100 would live. Mr Jas. Nankervis said at Balailey [sic: Belalie?] mail station adjoining the run, they had lost 16 horses for want of grass in eight months, though they had six miles of country. I saw several penniless migrants seeking work. It is a pitiful sight to see the natives on this run. They are in great distress. Where now are their hunting grounds or their game? Mr Hill the overseer says that many times he has given them tea, flour and sugar, though they are not employed. When in Adelaide he applied for assistance from the Protector of Aborigines, but was told he (the Protector) had no power to assist. The overseer said that in six years all that had been supplied by the Government for the natives had been 1 ton of flour, 2 bags of sugar and half a chest of tea. ‘Perhaps those good people in Adelaide willing to subscribe for the conversion of the blacks could first see that they did not die of starvation.’</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 2 May</p>
<p>Some talk has occurred recently about the formation of a District Council or a Corporation. Opinions for and against have been expressed. All agree that either one or the other should exist. In Kooringa many who hold their land on short leases object to paying rates to improve the value of dwellings belonging to the mine.</p>
<p>It has been proposed to present a memorial to the Directors that the new company, when formed, should have the power to sell the freehold to the properties in Kooringa, while reserving mineral rights. If they did this more substantial houses would soon appear. Should freehold be granted there would be no difficulty in forming a Corporation and this would then be able to see to the removal of the disgusting outhouses now so prominent and to see to the enforcement of sanitary rules.</p>
<p>Weather. On Monday there was a dust cloud extending high into the atmosphere and obscuring the sun. A fall of rain was anticipated, but fine weather set in without a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>Obituary/Accident. An old miner of Kooringa, Mr John Bowden, was using his horse and cart to sell lime in Market Square. A boy was driving and when dust got into his eyes he could not properly direct the course of the horse. The cart wheel fell into a gutter and the boy lost his seat. To save himself he leapt onto the horse’s back, causing it to kick. The boy fell between the horse and the shafts and the horse bolted. The deceased was in the cart and sought to grab the reins, bit the cart overturned with the deceased beneath. Apparently some part of the cart struck his head and he was killed instantly. A coroner’s inquest returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>

<p>On Friday 27 July Messrs Everard MP and Bright MP, two Commissioners of the Road Board, visited Kooringa.</p>
<p>Just before they arrived news had been received that more than 100 men were to be discharged from the Mine. As a consequence the local SM and several other residents waited on the Commissioners in the hope that some of these men might be employed on improving the wretched roads in the neighbourhood. Mr Bright said tenders would immediately be called for making a piece of road between MacNamara’s contract and the metalled portion near the Burra Hotel.</p>
<p>As for the Kooringa-Redruth Road, the surveyor would look at it in the morning and the subject would be considered at the next meeting of the Board in Adelaide. He was sorry to learn so many were out of work, but believed several road contractors were looking for workers. He added that the Government would only give piecework. He urged the propriety of forming District Councils and he thought it was a scandal that the northern areas had not taken advantage of this method of making roads.</p>
<p>Weather. Abundant rain has now fallen. Surplus water has caused the Burra Creek to overflow its banks in Redruth. This would not have occurred had not the Mine allowed such an accumulation of sand so as to act as a dam. The result will cause many houses in Redruth to be flooded in the first flood. Before the water could pass the dam in the present instance it was within a foot of the crown of the Redruth Bridge, completely flooding Mr Fogg’s house and washing down the back wall of one house on his premises.</p>
<p>Cook’s Circus paid Burra a visit, but due to the wet weather the attendance was meagre.</p>

<p>Recent reports of bank failures in England and Queensland seem to have led to a panic among locals at Burra on Saturday when they concluded that the National Bank in Kooringa was ‘broke’. This spread like wildfire and the bank authorities in Adelaide responded by sending a special escort from Adelaide on Saturday afternoon with enough gold bullion to cover all the deposits at the Burra branch. Last evening, Sunday 5 August our late respected manager Mr Wilkinson arrived with the necessary funds, having stated by telegram that the bank would open at 6 a.m. on Monday morning, prepared to pay all depositors their claims in bullion. When the bank opened this morning there were no customers. It was then closed and when it reopened at the usual time a few people took advantage of the offer to obtain gold for their deposits, but no unusual claims were made and the panic subsided.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr Edmund Bowman JP, one of the directors of the Union Bank, drowned last Tuesday night in a creek near his Pt Wakefield Station. He was seen to fall from a log bridge and it is presumed he struck his head so as to have been unable to save himself from the water, which was only four feet deep. A woman saw him fall and no assistance reached him in time to save his life. The deceased was esteemed for his sterling qualities. He had been extensively engaged in pastoral pursuits and will be remembered in connection with Crystal Brook, Wakefield and Mintaro Runs. He was a married man and leaves a young family. The body was recovered about sixty yards from the crossing. [Born 1818 Askham, Wessex and died 14 August Port Wakefield, residence Crystal Brook. There were seven children with birth dates between 1855 and 1865.]</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. On Monday last 13 August Mr Thomas Gubbins was employed at the sawmill and crusher at the Burra Mine. It was his duty to oil the machinery every morning and to save time he usually went through the raft-wheel of the crusher. The machinery is put in motion by the overshot waterwheel driven by water from the engine. Because of the rain on Saturday night it is believed the buckets had become full of water and the wheel was thus almost in motion. It appears likely that the deceased trod on an arm of the wheel, which was enough to start the machinery. He was found with his head crushed between an arm of the wheel and the floor and suspended with his feet nearly touching a beam. The inquest found death by accident.</p>
<p>[Born 1810 Tavistock, Devonshire: died 13 August 1866 Kooringa aged 56.]</p>
<p>Accident. A man named Owers, while working on a well on a neighbouring sheep station, was handling a charge of powder in a piece of rock when it exploded. The damage to his hands was so bad Dr Dashwood had to amputate both and there is no hope he will earn a livelihood again. He has a wife and three children.</p>

<p>‘A Miner’ writes to comment on a report that there is a contractor in Burra who would employ 20 good men:</p>
<p>There are 20 good men in Burra who have worked for him this last three weeks and would not do it again. He works them from 7 to 12 without a rest and appears to think men are like a machine – never tired. If he did not ‘nigger-drive’ his men he would get plenty in this neighbourhood. He offers men 4/- a chain to dig a drain 3 feet wide at the top, 18 inches deep and 9 inches wide at the bottom. I leave you to judge whether that is enough. (Kooringa 15 August.)</p>

<p>Obituary. Last week intelligence was received of the discovery of the remains of a man on the plains some 30 miles from Ketchowla. After considerable trouble Corporal Shaw and Police Trooper Catchlove found a human skeleton with completely bleached bones as if they had lain there for at least two years. There was no clue to the identity of the deceased. The police interred the bones before leaving the place.</p>
<p>William Owers, who lost both his hands through an explosion in a well, is progressing towards convalescence. He will not lose the sight of his eyes as was rumoured here last week Subscription lists have been opened and energetic measures will be taken to collect a sum to purchase a small life annuity for him. The Destitute Board can merely grant rations and as he is quite helpless efforts will be made to enable him to live the remainder of his life in tolerable comfort. [Owers eventually died 7 April 1900 at Aberdeen aged 74.]</p>
<p>The Road between Kooringa and Redruth must soon be surveyed. About 80 men are at work breaking metal for it. Sufficient will be broken in about a fortnight. They will then be out of work unless the cuttings and the spreading of metal can soon be commenced. The miners have proved themselves particularly fitted for this kind of work. Few will average more than 5/- a day on the road between the Telegraph Station and Redruth. The stone is very hard. At the other end of the contract, by the hotel, the stone is softer and they will do better.</p>
<p>Some good specimens have been exhibited from the Scrubbers’ Camp Mine. The ground is soft and is worked at the rate of £4 a fathom.</p>
<p>The Narkara hole has yielded some good ore and the promoters are hopeful of success.</p>
<p>It is hoped that our much respected friend Dr Mayne will resume his practice next week. All his patients and acquaintances congratulate him on his recovery during his recent trip to England.</p>

<p>‘Burra’ writes concerning the railway extension to the Burra:</p>
<p>I am surprised that in all the discussion about railways in the colony, no one seems to advocate the extension of the Northern Line to Burra. Adelaide merchants must recall the splendid trade done in Burra in her palmy days. I am convinced as much or more might be done if we had rail communications. There is much ore left in the ground and plenty of men to raise it. It stays there because of the enormous expense of carriage to and from the Mine. Under more favourable circumstances low grade ore could be extracted and either sent to Pt Adelaide or smelted here. In addition coal or firewood or both would be required here for both the Mine and inhabitants for domestic purposes and the population would grow. In addition agriculture is expanding between Burra and Kapunda and there is large traffic in wool from the north and with railways traffic in sheep would also come, either live or in the carcase. (Kooringa 23 August.)</p>
<p>30 August 1866, page 2</p>
<p>William Owers, we now learn has also lost his eyesight as well as both hands after the recent explosion in a well. He has a wife and three children, the youngest only three months old. He is utterly destitute, having been out of work for only a month after a long period of unemployment. Rev. Lionel W. Stanton is interesting himself in the case and though Government rations have been granted, he is seeking to get together such money as would ease his days beyond the necessities of the Government rations.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 29 August</p>
<p>The extension of the Northern Railway has been much discussed here of late among business people. There are many thousands of tons of ore now useless because of the high cost of carriage to markets. The produce from the northeast country would also utilise a railway from Burra. A public meeting will be held and out Parliamentary representatives will be requested to take action in the matter.</p>
<p>A railway would also open country around Booborowie, Canowie and Mt Bryan to the agriculturalist.</p>
<p>A funeral sermon was preached on Sunday 26 August at the Bible Christian chapel by Rev. Allen, touching the death of the late Mr Thomas Gubbins.</p>
<p>The Scrubbers’ Camp Mine has improved so much that the proprietors have decided to offer it to a public company. There are now several shafts on the property, all of them showing good signs and some yielding ore. The soft nature of the ground means it can be worked for £3 to £4 per fathom.</p>
<p>The Narkara proprietors are also trying to form a company to work their claim.</p>
<p>7 September 1866, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 6 September</p>
<p>The contemplated railway remains the chief topic of discussion. The townspeople are determined to do all they can to get a railway to the Burra.</p>
<p>Another lode of ore has been discovered on private property not far from Redruth.</p>
<p>Accident. Last Tuesday near Prince’s Town Patrick Dowd was driving a horse and cart and while crossing a creek near Finch’s the bridle came off the horse, which immediately bolted. Mr Finch tried to stop the horse, but it shied and tipped the cart over. Mr Dowd was much shaken, but the driver escaped with a bruise to his forehead. Dr Mayne who was just passing on his return to Burra was able to render assistance.</p>

<p>The men lately breaking stone for the road were discharged last week and have been kept waiting for their money. This is a great inconvenience as they could not leave to seek work elsewhere. Many were again set to work on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Accident. Two boys who were screening stones near some overhanging earth where the road metal is obtained were buried when the ground fell on them. Two men were nearby and extricated the boys before they suffocated. Their injuries were slight.</p>
<p>The railway question is still much discussed and the memorial prepared under authority of last week’s public meeting is being extensively signed.</p>
<p>Weather. It remains very dry. Farmers and stockowners are beginning to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Theft of firewood, even from fenced backyards at the rear of houses, continues to be a problem. Mr Charles Cowper of the Pig &amp; Whistle has lost an unusually large amount recently and so set a trap, connecting a piece of wood with a concealed gun loaded with saltpetre and buckshot with the muzzle pointed to the ground so that only legs could be hit. He heard the gun go off in the night at about 1.30 a.m. and someone ran away in haste.</p>

<p>Tramway Meeting at Mintaro</p>
<p>[There is a lengthy report on a meeting to discuss the desirability of a tramway from Port Wakefield to Mintaro. About 100 persons attended.]</p>
<p>17 September 1866, page 3</p>
<p>‘Burra’ writes from Kooringa, 12 September:</p>
<p>Having read the report on the Tramway Bill debate at Auburn, I cannot understand hoe the speakers think they have made a good case. Mr King says the Government would not build the railway to Kapunda unless it had some arrangement with the Patent Copper Company for the carriage of its goods. I believe the arrangement was made after the line was built. The company has a large amount of carriage, which renders it highly desirable to use an expeditious and cheap mode of transport. It must be obvious that it was not because of a tender affection between the Copper Company and the Government that the company was offered a rate better than usual. Neither did the company rush to support the railway for patriotic reasons. It is simply an example of a common rule of commerce that a wholesale customer is supplied at a cheaper rate than a retailer. This may not be a wise or a just decision by the supplier – after all, if the Copper Company paid the same rate as everyone else the general rate could be lower and this could see an increase in traffic.</p>

<p>Lionel W. Stanton writes from the Parsonage, Redruth, 8 September concerning the case of William Owers.</p>
<p>I wish to inform those who have responded to the call to aid Owers that it now seems that he will recover a little of his sight – sufficient to distinguish objects and so move about independently. This is a matter for rejoicing, though it does not diminish much the severity of the calamity or reduce his need for assistance ‘especially as contributions do not, at present, overwhelm us as a torrent’.</p>
<p>20 September 1866, page 4</p>
<p>Railway Extension Meeting at Saddleworth</p>
<p>The meeting was held at Mr Siekmann’s corn store at Saddleworth 18 September.</p>
<p>Mr Arthur Coleman JP presided. The object was to forward strong arguments to the Government in favour of a railway or a tramway to Saddleworth through a petition.</p>
<p>Mr E. Siekmann thought the Government should either privatise the railway or else extend it. To leave it as it is was to retard the progress of the colony. There was talk that an English company would be prepared to extend it north. The railway should be extended to a place which could show that it would be most productive and to which it could be completed most cheaply and also which would open up the best part of the colony. Promoters of the Pt Wakefield line made much of the 300,000 acres that had been sold west of the Skilly Ranges, but he believed much of this was held by agent for pastoralists. The argument that it would be benefit the people of Blyth and Hoiles Plains etc. failed if there was to be no great quantity of produce to shift.</p>
<p>He moved that the time had come to extend the railway from Freeling or Roseworthy through the Gilbert Valley east of Mintaro to some point at or near Burra. W.H. Harry seconded and Mr James Milne supported it. He pointed out that the Gilbert Valley was without good natural roads and that little had been spent on making roads either.</p>
<p>S. Dawson spoke in support, saying railways or tramways were needed to open up new land to provide for a growing population – though he wished the motion had not specified the route.</p>
<p>Mr Milne replied that the suggested route was the most central to the area with large tracts of agricultural land on either side.</p>
<p>Mr Thomas Jones expressed his disgust with the roads and supported the motion, which passed unanimously.</p>
<p>G.W. Byerlee then moved that such a line would pass through very thickly populated and productive country and would bring the pastoral country to the north into direct communication with the present line, the city and its port. He did not like the idea of a tramway, preferring to see a locomotive at the front of the train. The amount of money laid out on northern roads was ‘a mere bagatelle’. Last season he had seen at times 40 to 50 drays passing his house and now he scarcely saw one because the roads were so poor. People drove off the roads and made tracks through private property.</p>
<p>Mr Gurr seconded the motion. It was necessary to have speed in conveying their produce whether by a tramway or railway. Farmers could send down 200 or 300 bushels of wheat when it was opportune instead of storing it and trusting to wheat merchants for a return. Vast areas of agricultural land would be opened up. The Kapunda line had seen large sales of land in that district. Many northern mines would become viable with a railway, he believed. The motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>W.G. Cole said the strongest agitation had been for a line from Pt Wakefield to Auburn, but as others had said, there was not sufficient land along that route to produce a revenue and the route up the Gilbert would pass through one of the richest agricultural districts of the colony. It would open country north of Burra and provide for the easy conveyance of stock. He moved for the formation of a committee to draw up a petition, collect signatures and see it presented. John Moule seconded the motion, pointing out that having become the greatest wheat producing colony in Australia, an extension of railways was needed to protect their position as Victoria was rapidly extending a network of railways and land was being placed in the possession of farmers on easy terms. Carried without dissent.</p>

<p>Petty thefts seem to be on the increase. One night last week the detached kitchen of Mr Dunstan’s at the White Hart Hotel was entered and half a bag of flour and a new broom were taken. On Monday rations and other items were taken from a hut at Gum Creek.</p>
<p>On 8 October Mr McCulloch charged Michael Manning of Saddleworth with stealing 200 sheep from Princess Royal Station. A few months ago Manning passed Princess Royal with a flock of sheep en route to the Barrier Ranges. About this time 1,400 sheep were lost from Princess Royal. Last week Manning returned with another flock and when at Gottlieb’s Wells word was sent to Mr McCulloch that a number of sheep with the Princess Royal ear mark were in the flock. A warrant was issued. Manning says he could produce a receipt for the sheep and also the man who sold them if given time. The case was adjourned to 13 October and bail taken for his appearance.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association. Editorial</p>
<p>At present at the Burra Mines 445 people are employed and a large quantity of ore is being raised, but the low price of copper keeps down the prospects of work.</p>
<p>Shortly after the last Directors’ Report, which referred to the increased price of copper, there was a serious financial panic in London and the copper price fell by £8 per ton. The price has continued to decline to the lowest point in 16 years. The projected profits will not now appear. The latest reports show a rising copper price.</p>
<p>Despite employing fewer hands and working almost exclusively from old pitches the ore raised in the past six months is estimated at 2,626 tons of average 22% fine copper. The proposal to reconstruct the company has been postponed until financial conditions improve. In the meantime Directors will aim to limit expenditure while continuing to develop the mine.</p>
<p>Captain Roach reports:</p>
<p>Graves’ Engine Shaft is being sunk by 9 men and is 20 fathoms deep and in sinking the last ten fathoms a grey ore lode was discovered. Samples have assayed at 32 and 52% copper. The lode has taken a diagonal direction into the western hill. Once a plat has been finished a crosscut will be made west to investigate this lode. Sinking of the shaft will continue to the 30 fathom level.</p>
<p>Morphett’s Sump-men, when not engaged in the engine-shaft, are sinking Hector’s Shaft from the 50 to the 60 fathom level.</p>
<p>Tribute pitches in Peacock’s Main and Air Shafts are looking much more favourable.</p>
<p>Pitches in Ayers’ and Graham’s No. 1 &amp; No. 2 shafts are yielding the usual quantities of or of a good percentage.</p>
<p>Tribute ground in Kingston’s, Roach’s and Stocks’ Shafts is satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Secretary Ho. H. Ayers said there was more than enough produce in hand to pay the overdraft. Work at the mine continued night and day.</p>
<p>At the extraordinary general meeting, which followed, consideration was given to selling various lands [as listed in the advertisement 5 October 1866]. The Directors said they had no immediate intention of selling, but sought the authority to do so.</p>
<p>The Karkulto Mine was not included in the properties listed.</p>
<p>Mr Samuel Tomkinson asked why Kooringa was not included and the Chairman said they thought it more advisable to hold that property at the present time.</p>
<p>Mr Tomkinson then moved that the Directors be empowered to sell the properties as listed in the notice of 5 October – though he would have liked to see Kooringa included. Mr Henry seconded and it was passed unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr Glyde MP asked what the probable amount that could be so realised was and Mr Ayers said in round numbers it was between £5,000 and £6,000.</p>

An entire table is occupied with samples sent from the Moonta and Wallaroo Mines, the Burra Burra Mine, the All Nations Mine at Kooringa [?] and Mr F.C. Singleton’s section near Mt Barker. The Moonta collection is the richest of all with specimens yielding from 35 to 47 and 60%. Wallaroo proprietors sent specimen ores varying from 20?% to a natural coarse copper yielding 98.57%. Burra Burra proprietors sent nothing, but Hon. H. Ayers MLC sent a cabinet full of small specimens.</p>
<p>Other displays are bags of wheat, flour, and oats and jars and pots of fruits etc. and some very fine raisins. J. Tidmarsh &amp; Co. of Adelaide sent half a cwt of soap. There is also a display of agricultural machinery and some 610 samples of wines and liqueurs. Simpson &amp; Son sent a patent fire-proof safe. J.M. Wendt sent silverware including a fine candelabrum in the shape of a fern tree and an epergne in the form of a gum tree. There are specimens of woods from the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>The Port Wakefield Tramway</p>
<p>[Quite a long article reports evidence given to a select committee on this subject. The conclusion is that the port might be improved at moderate expense and a tramway 26 miles long to the Broughton would be a great advantage. It was far more difficult to get any agreement on the construction of east-west connections.]</p>

<p>On Sunday 4 November William Albe a bushman staying at a friend’s house in Aberdeen complained of being very ill and believed he had taken poison in mistake for salts. When he was worse two hours later John Robertson, his friend, questioned him and obtained an empty bottle labelled Strychnine Poison. Information was given to the Police who laid a charge of attempting to commit suicide. This broke down when Dr Dashwood said if he had taken 4 grains of what had been in the bottle he would have died within 20 minutes. It is presumed he lied about taking the poison and that the illness was overindulgence in alcohol.</p>
<p>William Isilin was arrested at Oulnina and charged with being a dangerous lunatic, but after a few days in custody his mind improved and he was discharged.</p>

<p>A new silver-lead mine has been found lately on some property belonging to Messrs Roach and Pascoe in the Wheelbarrow Hills about ten miles from Burra. A small vein led to better samples at 20 feet, which assayed at 80% lead and 6 oz of silver to the ton. If these indications continue a company will be formed to develop the venture.</p>

<p>Fire. Five men were fined from £2 to £3 each for leaving a camp fire alight at Mt Bryan. The magistrate hoped this might deter teamsters from leaving fires alight after camping: Thomas Miller, W.H. Vivian, Robert Pickford, James Pickford and Robert Cock.</p>
<p>Maurice O’Haren who cruelly deserted his five small children about 18 months ago was sentenced to two months’ gaol under that charge. [This offender appears in records variously as Maurice O’Haren, Maurice O’Hern, Morish O’Hearne and Morris O’Herne. His wife Mary died at Redruth 30 May 1865 aged 28.

<p>Mr Leyshon Jones has been experimenting with a new process for extracting copper from the sand in the Burra Creek. Results have been favourable. A load of sand is placed in a furnace and kept at a certain heat until converted into metal. Then by means of water the sand and metal are partially separated and the resultant metal is then smelted in the usual way. It is hoped by this method to recover copper from the low grade sands and the same process may be applied to low grade ores in the mine. If it is feasible on a large scale every ton of sand in the creek could be worth 10/- to the company.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Chapel celebrated its Anniversary last Sunday and Monday. Rev. Mr Lloyd from Gawler preached three impressive sermons. The usual tea and public meetings followed on Monday and £75 was raised from the Anniversary.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. August Fischer, a miner of intemperate habits met a friend named Killick outside the Miners’ Arms on Saturday evening 8 December. Killick asked him if he would have a nobbler. Deceased said no, he would have a bottle. Killick refused, but said he would give him half a pint if he drank it at one draught – if not the deceased was to pay half. The half pint was drawn and the deceased drank it at two draughts. Asked if he would have another, he said yes. This he drank and then fell down. It was assumed by all that he was intoxicated. At closing time (11 p.m.) he was laid on the floor of a bedroom with a pillow under his head. In the morning he was found there quite dead with his face embedded in the pillow. Dr Dashwood attended. An inquest was held before W.H. Challoner. The conclusion was that he died of apoplexy accelerated by drinking a pint of brandy. The jury censured the barman William Fowler and James Killick for administering the drink knowing at the time the deceased was under the influence of liquor.</p>
<p>[August Fischer died 9 December 1866, Kooringa aged 52.]</p>

<p>Christmas Day in Burra was most disagreeable. It began with a hot northerly wind, which increased in violence towards noon, becoming a gale, raising clouds of blinding dust. It ceased towards evening, when it became cooler. The public amusements were meagre, limited chiefly to tea meetings.</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodists celebrated their Sunday-school Anniversary in the usual manner.</p>
<p>Redruth and Copperhouse Bands of Hope had a tea and cake treat for their children, who, led by a drum and fife band paraded the town with banners flying. About 200 children took tea at Redruth.</p>
<p>In the evening there was a public meeting at the Court House where Mr Kelly of Clare gave a spirited address and the united Redruth and Copperhouse Fife bands produced such music as was never heard before in Burra.</p>
<p>At the Local Court on Wednesday Mr Cooper, landlord of the Miners’ Arms was fined £1 plus £1-14-0 costs for supplying drink to the late August Fischer, while he was in a state of intoxication.</p>

<p>Bushfires have been rife. At Booborowie on Sunday during a thunderstorm, lightning started a fire, but fortunately it was extinguished by a deluge soon after. At Mt Bryan Flat a fire near the hotel seems to have been started by some matches, but no one was around at the time. Grass adjacent to Captain Killicoat’s sections caught alight on Thursday evening 10 January. It was soon put out after hard work by neighbours. An incendiary is suspected, but there is no proof to hand.</p>

<p>A series of robberies has latterly been reported:</p>
<p>T. Richards [boots]</p>
<p>Mr Parks – bacon, cheese, a cake, onions, potatoes, envelopes, tea, etc.</p>
<p>Wesleyan Chapel – a glass bowl and a pair of brass candlesticks</p>
<p>Mr Morris’s shop – pickles, sugar and bottled fruit</p>
<p>Mr Lane’s shop – door wrenched open, but nothing taken</p>
<p>Mr Warnes’ hut at Devil’s Hole – twice – blankets, rations, a small telescope and a ring</p>
<p>Gum Creek – blankets</p>
<p>Mr Parks’ shop was again entered on Sunday night and watch was set. About 3 a.m. Thursday morning Mr Dyer and George Leinig saw a light in Mr Richard’s shop. When they investigated a figure fled. When the police investigated they found a skeleton key in Mr Richards’ lock and a strange door handle. (Mr Richards had removed his doorhandle to prevent the door being opened even if the lock were picked.) The key was found to open Mr Parks’ and Mr Morris’s front doors. Next morning Messrs Drew’s porter found three pairs of ladies’ uppers and a pair of ladies’ cashmere boots in their WC, apparently left there as the thief fled. Acting from the description of the man, Corporal Shaw issued a search warrant for the premises of one Charles Watts, a journeyman shoemaker of Kooringa, where they found a collection of stolen goods that were readily identified. Mr Waters, shoemaker, identified a whole lot of items. By the time all had been identified some 200 people had assembled and Watts was arrested. His wife was also arrested for receiving stolen goods.</p>
<p>Identification of many items was difficult in court and so Watts was charged on three accounts of entering and stealing from Mr Richards, James Waters and Thomas Parks’ shops and one charge of stealing from the Wesleyan Chapel. The prisoner came originally from Swan River and had conducted himself well around Burra for the last three years. His conduct in the court was most insolent and it was clear he was not unacquainted with such proceedings. He was committed for trial.</p>
<p>Fires at Kooringa</p>
<p>A serious fire occurred at the Burra Hotel on Friday night 25 January. The whole of the stables, Mr Williams’ malthouse and contents, a buggy, a valuable horse and a quantity of fodder were destroyed. It was a hot boisterous night and the alarm was raised a little before 11 p.m. The strong wind, the inflammable nature of the building and the absence of water or a fire engine made fighting the fire futile. It is amazing that the nearby wooden brewery building escaped due to the wind direction.</p>
<p>An inquest was held the next day before Mr MacDermott SM with Mr Lane as foreman of the jury. William Hayward ostler described his duties in the stable that night. A Chinaman named John gave the alarm at about 10.40 p.m.</p>
<p>Haywood did not smoke, smoking was not allowed in the stables and he had seen no one about the place smoking. William Kimball gave corroborative evidence. He had seen several boys walking from the brewery to the hotel. J.G. Lamb landlord of the hotel said he did not believe he had an enemy in Burra. He spoke to five boys in the stable yard (aged 12-14), reprimanded them and said he thought they had started the fire.</p>
<p>W.H. Williams said the fires in the brewery were always carefully extinguished when done with. None had been there for two days before the fire.</p>
<p>Neither the stables nor the malthouse were insured.</p>
<p>Thomas Moody Jnr was there before Mr Kimball, but saw no boys. Thomas Pearce barman was one of the first there and also saw no boys. The jury concluded there was no evidence to show how the fire started.</p>
<p>A bushfire occurred last Friday on Mr Hallett’s Wandillah Station – believed to have started from ashes thrown out of the house. It went south, burning the feed along the flat and a line of fencing. It entered Henry Pinch’s paddock and he is a great loser. The Burra Mines authorities, seeing the threat to their paddocks sent men in carts, their fire engine and water cart and so the fire was halted halfway across Pinch’s paddock.</p>

<p>The new process for roasting the sand in the creek so as to melt the ore and afterwards washing the sand away had a fair trial last week. The new furnace near the Mine Store was heated gradually and charged with 21 wheelbarrows of sand from the creek. After melting and washing it yielded 14%. The process was repeated twice a day for the week and on Saturday the operations were suspended so that wages, fuel and other costs could be calculated to see if the process was profitable. So far there has been no announcement.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Burra was astounded on Thursday 21 Feb. when all men employed at the Burra Mine, including officers, were given notice that their services would not be required at the end of the present take in seven weeks time. Business people in the town could face endless embarrassments and thrifty and industrious men could foresee no means of obtaining employment before starvation overtook their families.</p>
<p>There are many unemployed already and many have recently come from Wallaroo through those mines being overcrowded. On Sunday allusions to the calamity were made from all pulpits and the consolations of religion were urged upon all. At present no orders have been received to stop work in the new shaft. A hope is held that some tributers will be allowed to continue, but many feel this is an illusion as the mine has become too costly to pay for working at the present price of copper. The first batch of men, numbering 56, was discharged last Saturday and more will be discharged each Saturday until all are gone.</p>
<p>On Monday many men sought to see Mr MacDermott SM who granted an immediate interview. Spokesmen were J.M. Patterson of Copperhouse and Charles fellows of Kooringa. They said that on Saturday 24 tutworkmen, 7 mechanics and 25 surfacemen had been discharged and all but two of them were married with large families. Due to the high price of provisions in winter many had only just paid off debts incurred then. Mr MacDermott promised to do what he could and would write to the Government to urge public works. In fact he had written three weeks ago on that subject. There was a regulation in the Destitute Board that relief was not to be granted to a family of an able bodied man. He would, under present circumstances, disregard that regulation and would promise the men that their wives and children should not starve while they were away seeking work.</p>
<p>Mr Fellowes said many could not go. They were without money due to such low wages lately. He himself had only earned £45 at the mine in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Mr MacDermott said the contract for the Dry Creek loop line had just been let and miners were a very suitable class of men for the contractors to employ. Mr Patterson said that may be so, but how were men to get there without money. Mr MacDermott said ‘Where there’s a will, there’s a way.’ Empty wagons left Burra regularly for Adelaide and the Smelting Company’s teams were always on the road and either of these means could be had for a small consideration.</p>
<p>Mr Patterson said he had just returned from a 300 mile journey to the north and east and had frequently to pay 1/6 for a meal. No one could travel without money for food and lodging. Mr MacDermott said he could not advise them to stay in Burra as ‘it was the worst place in the colony for them’.</p>
<p>The men thanked him for his kindness. About 60 men were present.</p>
<p>28 February 1867, page 2</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>We have ascertained that it is the determination of the Directors to stop ore-raising after the end of the present take – probably about 28 March and in April they will decide how much exploratory work, if any, will proceed.</p>
<p>Orders have been given to continue work in the new shaft.</p>
<p>The Wallaroo Times reported on the contemplated stoppage, characterising it as one of the most serious items of news for some time. It will have a depressing effect upon the mineral reputation of the colony and throwing out of work some 500 men occurs at a time when work is by no means plentiful. Mineral exports will decline by c. £90,000 a year. The coal trade and the Smelting Company will also suffer. The last report of the company in October 1866 said the Mine was then generally satisfactory and raising ore at about 500 tons per month. It was then employing 448 hands. We fear the low price of copper must have determined the Directors to ‘knock the bal’.</p>
<p>We hope that before long the market will improve and the mine will again be worked. Burra has to pay a rate of carriage which would close several of the Peninsula mines if confronted with the same expense. A railway to Burra might see mining profitably resumed.</p>

<p>Gold is rumoured to have been discovered in the Barrier Ranges, but a telegram from Kooringa denies this and a mercantile firm has a letter from their Outalpa Station dated 26 February, which fails to mention it. The area involved is large and so the discovery might be unknown to these sources. Reports from the Darling Stations say some men have been heading to the area of the reports.</p>
<p>A letter to a city gentleman from Burra says several men have gone from there to the new diggings and Mr Dawson is going up to open a road on behalf of Cobb &amp; Co., whose fare to the Barrier Ranges is to be fixed at £6-6-0.</p>
<p>[The editor goes on to develop the idea of the desirability of a Government report on the existence and/or the extent of the field because it could save many people from much wasted effort and waste of money. The route to the area is a difficult one and not without danger.]</p>

<p>Employment prospects in Kooringa are hopeless, with more men discharged every week. The wider district provides no solution. Generally the gold discovery at the Barrier Ranges is doubted here. Letters coming from the area have not mentioned it and there is no report of shepherds deserting their flocks.</p>
<p>The unemployed met at the Redruth Court House on 14 March to consider the best means of getting work. Mr MacDermott recommended the men elect two representatives to travel to Adelaide and have interviews with the contractors for the Roseworthy-Forresters Railway and the Pt Wakefield Railway, to see if work could be obtained there. Mr MacDermott gave £1 to the clerk of the court to be given to the men after a further £9 had been collected to defray the costs of the delegation to Adelaide. Another friend left 10/- on the same conditions.</p>

<p>Reports from the Barrier Ranges differ, but most in Burra discredit those suggesting any significant success. Reports come from bushmen and are not given much credence.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Chapel had a tea meeting on 19 March to benefit the Circuit debt, but it was thinly attended.</p>
<p>Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary on 17 March. Tea and cakes and a public meeting followed as usual on Monday and in all £7 was raised.</p>
<p>The present take at the Mine will end on 28 March and all underground working will then cease. Some say the pumping engine will also be stopped.</p>
<p>This would force the suspension of work on the new shaft, now at 30 fathoms – 10 fathoms below water level. The miners say that if the water rose to that height the oldest workings would collapse and could not be re-opened without great expense. Most levels are kept ‘abroad’ by timber supported by ‘addle’ or rubbish and would collapse when submerged.</p>
<p>Mr Richards licensed spirit storekeeper was charged with selling less than one gallon of brandy – the smallest amount he is allowed to retail. After evidence from Zechariah Rees and Julius Stevens the Bench decided Richards was guilty and he was fined £10 plus £2 costs. Mr Benham for Mr Richards gave verbal notice of appeal.</p>

<p>First business was the examination of the preachers’ character</p>
<p>Secondly, reports from various stations were presented.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the finances of the district were investigated.</p>
<p>At 7 o’clock the chapel filled, with at least 500 people present. Mr Ashton preached the sermon and the Lord’s Supper was administered to the ministers and about 80 of the friends.</p>
<p>The 4th and 5th sessions on Friday morning considered the work of God in the colony.</p>
<p>The sixth sitting on Friday examined Bro. W.H. Finch for admission to the ministry and he was approved after 21⁄2 hours. Messrs Woolcock and Tresise were examined on the progress of their studies.</p>
<p>At 7 o’clock 570 people filled the chapel for the ordination service of W.H. Finch.</p>
<p>The ninth siting examined Mr McNeil, who was received as a candidate for the ministry.</p>
<p>The twelfth sitting concerned local matters:</p>
<p>The anniversary services of the chapel were deemed to have been of a high order and the collection of £21 was good considering the state of Burra.</p>
<p>The thirteenth sitting settled the ‘stations’. [That is the postings of the ministers to chapels and circuits.]</p>
<p>A tea meeting followed in the evening, with addresses by Messrs James Way, S. Keen, J. Ashton, T. Hillmann and J. Hancock. The collections and tea raised almost £50. The trustees and friends were pleased that in five years almost £1,000 of the debt had been paid off.</p>
<p>Tuesday was spent on correspondence and further consideration of financial matters.</p>
<p>S. Keen Chapel Secretary reported that in the past year there had been much progress with ten new chapels accommodating a further 1,500 people and two chapels ready to open in a month would accommodate 400 more. One third of debt on chapels had been paid off.</p>
<p>Wednesday saw a sermon by Messrs Richard Stoye &amp; Rock and the appointment of a committee to act with the General Committee on the Marriage Bill.</p>

<p>Burra Mine is now idle. All underground men ceased work today. The dressers will be kept at work for about a month. The officers and captains will then leave and the place will be deserted.</p>
<p>Fire. A fire broke out in Mr Bock’s hairdressing premises on 21 March. Mr Bock found some matches, paper and concertinas alight under his counter. He could not fight the fire as his tank was empty, but neighbours responded with water from their tanks and it was put out after doing sone £15 damage. His is the only insured premises in the row of buildings. Has the fire spread it would have destroyed seven more houses, some of them containing tradesmen’s stores.</p>
<p>At least one local man believes the report of gold being discovered at the Barrier Ranges. He and two of his sons will leave for there on Monday next.</p>

<p>‘An Old Burra Miner’ writes to the editor:</p>
<p>With news of the stoppage of the Burra Mine many readers may be under the impression that this source of wealth is exhausted. Most of the ground in the richest portion of the mine has undoubtedly been worked, in some instances over and over again. Still, there are many places where there is payable ore and so it is surprising to hear of its being closed down, especially when in new areas the lodes have not been followed in the lower areas of the mine. At 70 fathoms a splendid lode bears away towards the Burra Hotel and Princess Royal Mine. The excuse for the stoppage is the expense of keeping the mine dewatered. ‘The mine could only be kept clear of water at the 70 fathoms level by two large engines, involving the outlay of £100 a week each.’</p>
<p>One engine was stopped and the water allowed to rise to the level maintained by one engine. Considering the large dividends paid it is surprising how few trial shafts have been sunk – not more than three or four in an area of about ten square miles.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal Mine is now at work and yielding excellent returns to a small party of miners.</p>
<p>The wells of the Burra Hotel and neighbourhood have lost their water as the mine has been deepened, indicating the lie of the land. Cost saving could be effected by the use of machinery in ore dressing – the machinery at the mine being very meagre.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 3 April</p>
<p>The Barrier Ranges gold claims are getting much attention here, but so far conclusive links in the chain of evidence are wanting. Many people have nevertheless decided to visit the area. Mr Luke a sheep farmer in the area arrived yesterday and says gold has been found, but not in payable quantities. An old digger who has returned from the Barrier says 100 men are at Menindie waiting to return on the mail – the diggings having proved a failure.</p>
<p>The Catholic Bishop Dr Shiel arrived here on 2 April, having been escorted from Gum Creek by about 25 horsemen and 15 carts. He was accompanied by Fr Tappeiner SJ, Superior of Sevenhills College and Ft Polk of Sevenhills. He was presented with an address signed by:</p>
<p>W.F. Coglin Jos. Fogg John O’Leary</p>
<p>John Walsh Jas. Fitzgerald Martin Howard</p>
<p>The Bishop responded, addressing the gathering of about 300 persons.</p>
<p>On Wednesday 3 April Very Rev. Fr Tappeiner celebrated Mass and his Lordship baptised 19 postulants. The chapel was densely crowded. In the evening the Bishop went to Sevenhills College.</p>

<p>Flood. On the night of the 5 &amp; 6 April one of the largest floods know affected Aberdeen and Redruth. It began raining at 11 p.m. Friday and continued for several hours. The creek peaked at 6 a.m. with 15 inches of water in the White Hart Hotel and 2 feet in the Aberdeen Hotel. In Richard Davey’s house it reached the window sills and was halfway up the windows in Fogg’s house. Several other homes were flooded. In the White Hart the walls of three rooms have collapsed and the cellar has fallen in, destroying a set of photographic instruments. The household furniture is much damaged. At the Aberdeen Hotel the cellar is much damaged and one of the side walls on the lower floor is badly damaged, as is the household furniture. Mr West’s cellar in Redruth has fallen in and the foundations of the back kitchen sank. The water rose higher than in previous floods because the natural watercourse has been filled in with sand from the Mine. Those affected are talking of suing the Mining Company. The water covered the new road opposite the hospital [i.e. Bleak House] as well as that leading to the new ford, the piles of which were entirely covered.</p>
<p>Many people have passed through en route to the Barrier Ranges. All are well equipped with drays, provisions and tools.</p>
<p>The tributers at the mine are washing their ore and preparations are being made for an almost complete stoppage at the end of the month. Wages have been reduced for the few remaining.</p>
<p>18 April 1867, page 2</p>
<p>‘Surprise’ writes from Redruth 9 April.</p>
<p>I was surprised at the Mine stoppage, having always thought of the Directors as men gifted with more than the ordinary amount of talent. Many are saying the move is but part of a process that will yet astonish the world. If the object is to lower wages it looks like burning the house down to heat the oven. If the object is to sell the mine, everyone knows that selling a ‘knocked bal’ is like trying to sell a dead dog.</p>
<p>[He goes on to consider that in Cornwall if a mine needed money for exploration when conditions were bad than a call would be made on the shareholders, but it seems different here.]</p>
<p>It is also very hard that as well as losing their jobs the miners should lose all the investment they have made in building homes, which are the company’s asset. It is a serious thing for the colony to throw hundreds of men out of work, to destroy their years of savings and make property valueless that was worth thousands.</p>
<p>18 April 1867, page 3</p>
<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The AGM of shareholders of the Association was held on 17 April with Hon. G.S. Kingston in the chair.</p>
<p>The report was taken as read.</p>
<p>The production of copper had been almost as much as the preceding six months; 2,534 tons of ore being raised. Despite this the Directors said that although they had cut costs the falling value of copper forced them to order the discontinuance of mining from 28 March. They decided to limit operations to the keeping of water out of the principal workings, sinking Graves’ new engine shaft and washing and dressing low class ore in the Burra Creek. Active working is not suspended because ore is exhausted, but merely because it cannot be raised profitably while the copper price remains at its present level. The time may soon come when lower transportation costs or lower dressing costs or a higher copper price or a combination of these may again make it profitable to work the mine. In the meantime expenses will be kept as low as possible.</p>
<p>The financial statement showed a probable loss on the last year’s operations of £7,389.</p>
<p>E.C. Homersham wondered whether an attempt had been made to save money by the men working eight hours a day instead of six. The Chairman said they already worked eight hours a day as was usual there and in other mines.</p>
<p>The Secretary Mr Ayers said the wages earned by miners in the past six months had averaged less than £1-14-0 a week. The question of wages had been considered carefully and there was not much chance of a reduction. He said there was no use raising ore and exhausting the mine without profit. They had raised nearly 2,500 tons averaging 22%, but had received no dividends since December 1864. A sum of £21,640 had been transferred from the stock account to the profit and loss account. Operations would continue in Graves’ New Engine Shaft and dressing of low grade ores in Burra Creek.</p>
<p>The last sale of 200 tons of copper was made at £78 per ton, which was £17 less than the rate in 1864.</p>
<p>The Directors had sold only one of the properties they had permission to dispose of and the terms were not such as to justify selling any more. Mr Tomkinson hoped that the remaining running expenses might be met from the proceeds of the halvins. He also thought it a pity the mine had been carried on for two years when the ore was simply being given away. He felt new discoveries might well prove to be cheaper to mine and so see the operation at a profit within a moderate period.</p>
<p>The retiring Directors Messrs Thomas Graves, Arthur Blyth, George Strickland Kingston, John Beck and Thomas Greaves Waterhouse, were re-elected.</p>
<p>The fee for Directors attendance at a meeting was reduced for one guinea to half a guinea.</p>

<p>Accident. A 15-year-old son of Mr W.H. Broad of Sod Hut Ranges was walking with a mule team on the Adelaide Road near Mr Bock’s on 12 April. He was climbing onto a wagon while the mules were stationary when they suddenly moved forward and he was thrown to the ground. The wheels passed over his foot, ankle and part of his leg, completely crushing them and then passed over his wrist. The victim was taken to Dr Mayne and Dr Dashwood and the leg was immediately amputated. The arm has not yet been amputated.</p>
<p>Despite contrary reports many people have passed through en route to the Barrier Ranges. Some say the diggings are actually at Cooper’s Creek.</p>

<p>Easter passed with only religious amusements. The most popular was the Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary. About 300 children from 5 to 15 were arranged in steep galleries either side of the pulpit. Mr Thomas Moyses of Clare preached twice and Rev. W.S. Worth addressed teachers and scholars in the afternoon. On Monday there were sports on Limestone Hill with tea and cakes followed by a tea meeting in the evening and then a public meeting. The collections this year were trifling.</p>
<p>The Church of England has the usual services on Good Friday and on Easter Monday Rev. L.W. Stanton entertained the Sunday-school children at the parsonage in Redruth.</p>
<p>Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Sunday School Anniversary was also celebrated on Good Friday and Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>A Farewell Banquet was given at the Burra Hotel on 2 May to the chief officers of the Burra Mine: Captain Roach; Mr W.H. Challoner JP, accountant; Mr W.K. Elphick, assayer; on the occasion of their ceasing to hold the situations they had so long filled. Hon. G.S. Kingston took the chair. Among the 60 or so diners were Mr E.B. Gleeson SM of Clare, Messrs Porter JP, J. Chewings JP, A. McCulloch MP, Drs Mayne, Davies (of Clare), &amp; Dashwood, Mr Arthur King JP of Watervale, Captain Killicoat and Mr E. Hampton. [Toasts are reported.]</p>
<p>Hon. G.S. Kingston said Captain Roach had been there more than twenty years, arriving about June 1846 and had never failed to fulfil his duties to both employers and employed. He had superintended the raising of 200,000 tons of perhaps the richest ore in the world, worth £2,000,000 to the colony. The mine had employed large numbers, contributed to the development of Kooringa and the district and been the source of profit to many now in flourishing circumstances.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner had been employed by the company for twenty years, arriving but a year after Captain Roach. Large sums has passed through his hands in wages and for the purchase of timber and other supplies and all without exciting ill feeling or dispute and with the strictest integrity.</p>
<p>Mr Elphick was a younger employee and had lived for about nineteen years among the inhabitants of Kooringa. In all those years his assays had rarely been challenged and on those rare occasions had been resolved in his favour. In assays between the Mine and the Copper Company the latter sometimes complained his results were too high, but again when referred to Me Walters, the highest authority in England, the result favoured Mr Elphick.</p>
<p>Captain Roach was cheered when he rose to express his thanks.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner stated that the present was not the proudest moment of his life. He felt sure that when they were all dead the mine would again be worked and be more prosperous then than ever.</p>
<p>Mr Elphick expressed his thanks to those assembled.</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat said that eighteen years ago the copper price was as low as now, had then risen to £137 a ton and since fallen again to £78, but there were no reasons to suppose it would not rise again.</p>
<p>The mine only went to 60 fathoms and it would certainly go deeper, although perhaps not by the present company. Another cause of the stoppage was the lack of a railway. Had that been made sixteen years ago the Burra would not now be in its present plight.</p>
<p>[Various other toasts followed.]</p>
<p>Hon. G.S. Kingston said he had arrived in SA thirty-three years ago. He had laid out Burra twenty-two years ago and always felt a great interest in its progress. He felt sorry for its present state and believed there would yet be good times ahead.</p>
<p>The meeting terminated at midnight.</p>
<p>10 May 1867, page 3</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 8 May</p>
<p>The railway to Burra is the cause of much agitation again. A preliminary meeting was held on Tuesday 3 May and a public meeting was arranged for the next week. When it is considered there are many thousands of tons of ore lying useless at the Mine, which would pay handsomely if cartage were cheaper, all must admit the force of Burra’s claim for a railway.</p>
<p>Prospects at the Mine are very bleak, with men leaving the district daily. Many of the best men are going to Victoria where wages are particularly good for skilled men.</p>
<p>The complimentary dinner at the Burra Hotel was a complete success.</p>
<p>Accident. Am itinerant fiddler at the Burra Hotel was kicked in the chest and chin by a horse last week. He fell back on the ground and his breathing became slower and slower until it stopped. He was presumed dead when Dr Mayne came, but after the doctor had inflated his lungs, poured stimulants down his throat and applied artificial respiration, the man quickly recovered.</p>
<p>Princess Royal Mine is attracting great attention with 16 pitches let. The lessees Messrs Brenton &amp; Farley expect to employ 100 more within a month. It is said the reason for the mine’s earlier failure was the high rate of wages. This will prove a great benefit to unemployed miners if the expectations of the proprietors are met.</p>
<p>Heinrich Sievert was charged today with stealing a hat, the property of Corporal Shaw, from the dining room of the Burra Hotel on 2 May. He was committed for trial at the next Local Court of Full Jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr Tennant, well known squatter of Pt Lincoln died at the Globe. At the last Thebarton races while passing from the Grand Stand to the paddock he fractured his ankle.

He was aged 77.</p>

<p>Railway to the Burra</p>
<p>A meeting at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday evening discussed the question of a railway to Burra. Despite very wet weather 130 persons attended and Mr A. McCulloch MP was voted into the chair.</p>
<p>Mr McCulloch said that the construction of the Roseworthy to Forresters [Tarlee] line had begun. Last November the Chief Secretary said that to extend this line west of the Skillogolee Ranges and thence via the Gulnare Plains to Mt Remarkable would place it too far west. He then considered going up the Gilbert Valley and Farrell’s Flat, which he thought too far east.</p>
<p>[Mr McCulloch said there were many views, but he favoured the Gilbert Valley to Saddleworth and thence to Farrell’s Flat.]</p>
<p>Wherever it goes there must be as least a branch line to Burra. There are two important benefits of a line to Burra – the quickness of the transport of ore and the speed in the transport of stock.</p>
<p>Mr Challoner read a letter from Hon. J.H. Barrow alluding to support in the Advertiser, and the Chronicle for a railway to Burra.</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat proposed that the railway from Forresters north be proceeded with at once, as sanctioned by Parliament.</p>
<p>Some might argue that with the Mine closed a railway to Burra was now wasted, but the closure of the Mine was only for the present and there was still plenty of ore there. What they needed was cheaper transport to make 10% ore marketable. With that object gained mining might be carried on almost for ever.</p>
<p>[He then elaborated on costs and viability of the Mine for various percentage ore types.]</p>
<p>It might be asked why the railway hasn’t been extended before. How is it that even the Burra Directors have not previously supported the extension?</p>
<p>‘The Directors did not advocate a railway before because they were not selfish, and did not wish to say anything so long as good dividends were turned in.’ (Hear, hear and laughter.)</p>
<p>He believed a railway would lead to a number of small mines being opened up. He had visited Princess Royal last Tuesday and they were raising as good malachite there as he had seen at Burra. He understood five or six pitches were at work and seventeen let. He thought £4,000 to £5,000 could see it developed and 300 to 400 could be employed. Specimens had assayed at 261⁄2%. Furthermore roads in the north were poor. In January 1865 money was granted for the road at the Sod Hut Ranges and it had not been laid out yet – despite repeated questions from Hon. H. Ayers in the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Mr William Pierce [sic: for Pearce?] seconded. He thought they had been too quiet in the past. They needed a working committee to keep the matter constantly before Parliament and the public. At present there were hundreds of unemployed men who were willing and anxious to work on such a project. All that was needed was the passage of a Bill through Parliament authorising the expenditure. Several routes had been surveyed. Agriculture and pastoralism would also benefit greatly from its construction.</p>
<p>Miners were leaving Kooringa as fast as possible and it was necessary to find work for them until mining operations could be resumed.</p>
<p>Mr Ridgway spoke in support and the motion was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>W.H. Challoner spoke of the money the Mine had put into the community and cited statistics for 191⁄2 tears up to 31 March 1867:</p>
<p>For labour in building nearly £30,000</p>
<p>For dressing ore £90,000</p>
<p>For horse feed, attendance etc. £70,000 – showing that farmers had good reson for regretting the mine’s stoppage</p>
<p>For unskilled labour £300,000</p>
<p>For mechanics and overseers etc. c. £70,000</p>
<p>Tributers and ore raised £700,000</p>
<p>The officers £50,000 to £60,000</p>
<p>Rough timbers and firewood £200,000</p>
<p>Tutwork £140,000</p>
<p>To sick &amp; injured workmen £15,000</p>
<p>And other small sums amounting to £20,000 to £30,000</p>
<p>This showed the importance of having the Mine and to have it in operation they needed a railway and needed it quickly. He especially deplored the coition of the unemployed men’s wives and families. He moved that the already surveyed line be carried out, as labour was plentiful and there were great facilities for obtaining capital from England. J.R. Stephens seconded the motion and developed the arguments. Mr Ernest Siekman also spoke in support. He suggested that agriculture would be as big a supporter of the line as the mining industry.</p>
<p>The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>William Young moved that the meeting urge upon Parliament the desirability of commencing construction of the line from both ends and Mr Godson seconded. He stressed the fact that the land through which the line would pass was already largely bought ready for agricultural development.</p>
<p>Mr Owen Harvey spoke in support, but Mr Siekman thought this move would be seen as selfish and thus be unpopular. Mr Challoner then suggested that the work ‘start at various points on the line’.</p>
<p>Mr Ridgway supported the original motion and Mr Moody, Mr Challoner’s amendment, which was eventually carried.</p>
<p>A memorial for presentation to Parliament was then read by Mr Rosman. As well as making the principal points discussed at the meeting, it suggested that the amount of traffic furnished by the Burra Mine would almost itself be sufficient to defray the working costs of the extension, as no less than 1,000 tons of ore per month could be raised, involving the movement of at least 12,000 tons of coal annually for smelting. The extension of the line would result in the almost certain speedy resumption of work at the Burra Mine.</p>
<p>Mr Moody moved the adoption of the memorial and that signatures be obtained.</p>
<p>Mr W.H. Rosman seconded and Mr S. Drew supported.</p>
<p>Mr J. Rounsevell spoke, discussing the alternative routes and concluding that the Auburn area could better be served from Pt Wakefield. He favoured a line from Forresters, the present terminus, to Riverton, Saddleworth, Farrell’s Flat and then into or near Burra. He did not think a branch line to Burra was suitable for a place where ‘from the natural course the traffic and produce from the north, north-east and surrounding districts had always taken.’</p>
<p>It had been shown the railway would raise the price of copper about £10 per ton and would also raise the price of farmers’ grain 8d to 1/- per bushel by saving on cartage. He also urged the establishment of a District Council or Corporation, which by raising modest rates would have them doubled by the Government and could ask for special funds for urgent works.</p>
<p>Mr W.H. Rodman pointed out that a Corporation would have the effect of requiring tenants of SA Mining Association to pay for improvements to land belonging to the Association. The motion was carried.</p>
<p>A motion was carried that Mr A. McCulloch MP be requested to present the petition in the House of Assembly and Mr J.B. Neales MP be asked to support it and that in the Legislative Council Hon. J.H. Barrow be asked to present the petition and the Hon. Captain Bagot be asked to support it. Carried.</p>

<p>The Railway Meeting at Burra Hotel on 14 May was a great success, even though the weather was bad.</p>
<p>The Local Court heard a case of cattle stealing last Monday. Messrs Ware &amp; Chapman have for a long period discovered cattle losses from their run. They found the carcases had been removed on horseback. On 2 May they came across Joseph Webb and Edward Rowe at work cutting up a carcase. One of them offered the stock-keeper £5 to turn a blind eye. The Bench committed the defendants to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Princess Royal Mine continues to look promising. 10 tons of good ore are at grass and the men at work calculate they have earned £1 each per day.</p>
<p>Mr Murphy has made a new copper discovery at Booborowie. 15 cwt of ore was brought in for smelting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Men are still at work at the Barrier Ranges, but there is no news of actual gold being recovered.</p>
<p>Miners are leaving Burra daily in search of work, which has been rather difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>Legislation for Railway Extension (Editorial)</p>
<p>Parliament has been prorogued and seems to have no great desire to reconvene.</p>
<p>The railway extension question was treated last session as a matter of urgency. The select committee’s report was read, but no further action was taken.</p>
<p>The whole matter was dealt with in the report and all settlers are asking for is the implementation of its recommendations. Politicians might be concerned about the costs of railway north of Pt Augusta, but the settlers want ordinary means of communication in the old established districts. Railways should connect our main agricultural and mining districts with the metropolis and shipping ports of the colony. Wherever the nature of the country permits the means of communication should be railways, as they are more economical than macadamised roads. The lines recommended include:</p>
<p>Forresters to Saddleworth to Burra</p>
<p>Adelaide to Glenelg</p>
<p>And surveys for Clare District to Kadina</p>
<p>All the settlers want in this matter is the extension of roads – iron rails being used instead of broken stone.</p>
<p>As for a line beyond Pt Augusta – instead of borrowing heavily, it could be financed by land sales along the route, with some other encouragement from the Government.</p>

<p>A Trip to the North</p>
<p>The trip to Kapunda by train is rendered tedious by the wearisome stoppages and slow advances, so that a trip that should take 11⁄2 hours for the 50 miles can take two or even three hours.</p>
<p>Gawler seemed very dull. Business was very quiet and there was a feeling of general depression.</p>
<p>At Kapunda had breakfast at the Sir John Franklin and bought a ticket for Clare in a strongly-built Cobb &amp; Co. coach behind four capital horses. However, we soon left the made road for a jolting tumbling and rocking ride through an adjoining station for some five or six hours.</p>
<p>‘Nothing in its way can exceed the nonchalance of the coachman. He makes his horses plunge headlong over crevices and ruts which would cause a nervous lady to shriek and even a bold driver to be cautious.’</p>
<p>Clare was full of talk about the railway from Pt Wakefield. Clare district farmers this season are paying 35/- a ton cartage to Yorke Peninsula compared with 50/- previously and this has enabled them to compete with the Adelaide shippers to the Peninsula. Fruit, vegetables and dairying would flourish here is transport costs were lowered and such id the potential of a tramway. Wool would also benefit by a connection with Pt Wallaroo.</p>
<p>After two or three days in Clare, I set out for Burra. For twenty miles of dreary landscape I saw one man driving a team of horses and another mending a fence.</p>
<p>‘My approach to the Burra was not at all calculated to prepossess me in its favour.’ A few drops of rain fell, followed by a strong easterly and clouds of dust, before the shower began in earnest. Burra was in a sad state, the last of the men at the mines having just been dismissed.</p>
<p>‘Family after family were bidding adieu to the place which had been their home for years, while one after another disappointed and crestfallen were returning from their ill considered journey to the Barrier Ranges.’</p>
<p>The general thought was that the only thing to save Burra was the construction of the railway. In that all seemed to concur. It is not debated, but seen as an absolute necessity. Total abandonment of the place is seen as the alternative.</p>
<p>I left at daybreak the following morning for Clare.</p>
<p>[The writer then describes his journey to Yorke Peninsula at great length. He visited Kadina and Wallaroo (but not Moonta) before returning to Adelaide.]</p>

<p>Three wagons and parties comprising residents from around Mintaro and some Burra miners returned from the Barrier Ranges on the evening of 24 May. They report plenty of holes, but no gold.</p>
<p>On Thursday 23 May Rev. L.W. Stanton gave one of his amusing entertainments comprising readings from popular authors supplemented by amateur musicians. The aim was to provide some aid for a poor, but deserving widow. [The program is printed.] The sum collected was £6-15-0, which together with the previous week’s takings made £16-8-0.</p>
<p>Rev. M.C. Patchell, Wesleyan Minister from Wallaroo, has been here since 17 May as deputation for the Home Mission Fund. He gave a lecture at the Kooringa Wesleyan chapel on 22 May on ‘The Future Residence of the Saints of this World’. Several public meetings have been held on the object of the Mission.</p>
<p>On the Queen’s Birthday holiday there were races at Mt Bryan Hotel, but few people attended and the racing was not of the best order. On the way home Mr Opie’s cart overturned and a son of Mr Potter sustained a severe leg injury.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal Mine still looks well and if some capital can be obtained to crush ore many think it will prove a splendid mine. There are large piles of ore at grass.</p>
<p>8 June 1867, page 2</p>
<p>‘A Burra Miner’ writes re a Burra Railway:</p>
<p>The suspension of operations at the Burra Mine have surprised many and caused some distress among the unemployed. Many who have a little capital are leaving for Victoria. This loss of migrants that the Government spent money to bring to SA is to be regretted and the immediate construction of a railway to Burra would have furnished work for the miners until the mine could be re-opened. Immense quantities of high grade ore remain, but cannot be profitably removed given the low copper price and the high cartage costs. The Burra Mine has been of immense value to the colony and is now crippled by high transport costs.</p>
<p>13 June 1867, page 3</p>
<p>The Kapunda Mines</p>
<p>The mines are in transition. The rich ores have gone.</p>
<p>The first discovery was made by Messrs C.S. Bagot and F.S. Dutton while seeking some stray sheep. The first ore was raised on 8 January 1844 and the first five dray-loads of ore departed Kapunda on 23 January 1844. The first horse whim to drain water began on 4 March 1845 and kept the mine dry to 15 fathoms. A steam engine began to pump water on 1 July 1848. Crushing machinery followed. A larger engine began work in January 1851. As at 1862 all water was directed to one shaft and pumped out by this larger engine. The first engine was then used for haulage and crushing.</p>
<p>Smelting began in December 1849 and for some time a large portion of the ore was reduced to regulus before shipping. The gold rushes saw smelting cease between March 1852 and March 1855. Nearly all the miners left and it was with difficulty the engine was kept going to keep the mine dry. At one point there were just four miners, but the men returned in 1854 and especially early in 1855.</p>
<p>The ore types are quite varied. To December 1864, 35,280 tons of 21 cwt had been raised of an average produce of 20%. Underground workings are nearly all confined to the first 80 acre section number 1271, though the company acquired sections 1284 and 1405 to the south of the original section and some allotments north and part of section 1400. [The engines, machinery and buildings at the mine are then detailed.]</p>
<p>All the ores raised are now reduced to fine copper before shipping.</p>
<p>[Operational changes introduced under Captain Osborne are the detailed, including changed ore treatment arrangements.]</p>
<p>The smelting works have been abandoned.</p>
<p>[There is then discussion of the production of copper dust of 80% copper to be exported to England in casks.]</p>
<p>All carriage within the site will be on tramways.</p>
<p>Handling ores according to Henderson’s Patent is said to accommodate then as low as 3 or 4 %. The process has not been made public, but involves wet and dry operations. The wet operation uses sulphuric acid.</p>
<p>It is estimated some 30,000 to 40,000 tons of ore have been raised at 4 to 5% copper and this will be subject to the process. Great quantities of water will be needed and will be taken from the deepest shaft.</p>
<p>Previously much copper in solution escaped into the River Light, but efforts will be made to contain this extravagance. At present about 200 persons are employed – 100 of them tributers.</p>
<p>The new company objects to the workings being within the Corporation boundaries with the accompanying rates charges and they also object to the railway’s rates for carriage. They believe they are entitled to concessions as they presently pay £400 to £500 a month and expect shortly to increase that to £1,000.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 12 June</p>
<p>When Messrs W. Everard MP &amp; Mr H. Bright MP as members of the Central Road Board arrived in Burra as part of a tour of inspection, a few leading inhabitants decided to wait on them. [A list is printed.]</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat introduced the deputation and said they were far from satisfied with the state of the main lines of road near Burra. Firstly in the Sod Hut Ranges money had been appropriated to make the road in 1865, but nothing had been done. He did not blame the Board, but their surveyor Mr Macaulay. Also the road between Burra and Sod Hut was disgracefully formed. Instead of a crown in the centre of the road there was a hollow. Spoon drains had been made instead of culverts – equally expensive, but not nearly so effectual. The road, though newly laid, was almost as bad as before it was metalled – a fact he attributed to a poor foundation.</p>
<p>Mr Dawson corroborated Captain Killicoat’s statements and also referred to the dangerous crossing known as Thomas’s Gap about two miles north of Kooringa, which would be totally impassable in winter.</p>
<p>Mr John Roberts, Mr William Pearce and Mr O. Harvey spoke at some length in support. Mr Bright said in reply that he felt Mr Macaulay had not been fairly treated and was not so much to blame as had been stated.</p>
<p>The road through the Sod Hut Ranges would have been completed, but for the absurd amount of compensation demanded by Mr Broad, through whose property it would pass. He wanted £5 per acre instead of the £3 offered and also £150 for the removal of a sheep yard and brush fencing. The road would be gazetted in about a week and work begun immediately. With reference to the piece of road near the Mine Store, they had instructed the Surveyor to commence a bridge across the mine watercourse there at once, which would be on the same level as the road recently made. [The Mine Bridge.] They had ordered a watertable be made on the western side of Commercial Street. Work on the Thomas’s Gap would be done as soon as possible. When about fifty unemployed men waited upon the Commissioners, seeking work, they were told twenty could start work raising and breaking metal on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Sunday was Whit Sunday and the Bible Christian Sunday-school Anniversary was held. Rev. W. Allen, the local minister, preached morning and evening and in the afternoon Rev. Jarrett, the Primitive Methodist Minister gave the address. On Monday the children had tea and cakes and an adult tea meeting followed. The collections raised £32.</p>
<p>At the Sunday afternoon service an unfortunate accident occurred to a temporary gallery erected for the children’s accommodation at the end of the chapel. During a hymn one of the boards broke and the boys and a teacher on it fell to the ground. The girls heard a crash and cries of alarm and they in turn screamed and surged forward down the tiers to the bottom, endangering limbs in the panic. The panic spread to the congregation, some of whom rushed outside. Fortunately the office bearers managed to calm things down and were able to assure everyone that there had been no serious injuries and after much trouble the service was resumed from the point of interruption.</p>
<p>A new cobalt mine has been opened lately and a company formed in Burra with £1,000 capital – half a crown paid up. With this the Directors will raise five tons of ore and send it to England to decide on the venture’s viability.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal Mine continues to look well with 14 men working 7 pitches. One pair calculated they earned £50 for nine days’ work.</p>
<p>Mr Dutton MP and Mr Tomkinson visited the adjoining Dutton’s Square Mile last week to inspect a continuation of the lodes and it is possible these too could be developed.</p>
<p>The proposed railway remains a prime topic of discussion and the farmers continue to lament the closure of the mine. Nearly 200 are employed in the creek dressing low grade ore, but the labour market is still very full, with many idle.</p>
<p>15 June 1867, page 3</p>
<p>Railway Extension to Burra</p>
<p>A public meeting was held at the Court House in Redruth, Wednesday 12 June, to consider the best means of advancing the cause of a railway to Burra. About 100 attended. Mr M. MacDermott took the chair.</p>
<p>Mr Goodridge said that it was desirable for the railway to be extended from Forresters to some point near Redruth and moved a motion accordingly. [His arguments were basically as previously noted.]</p>
<p>He thought there was not the remotest chance of the Burra Mine being restarted unless a railway was built. He believed the natural place for a temporary terminus would be just above the Bon Accord Mine at Redruth – he said temporary, as he predicted it would be extended to North West Bend.</p>
<p>Mr John Sampson seconded it and argued that Burra could offer more inducements than any other place for expenditure on a railway on account of the mineral wealth and because that would produce more traffic than 50 miles of agricultural land.</p>
<p>Mr West also supported the motion.</p>
<p>[In addition to the points already made he stressed the fact that a terminus near Redruth would enable the farmers of Mintaro and other villages to send their produce to the profitable market Burra would provide.]</p>
<p>The resolution was carried.</p>
<p>Mr Samuel Sampson proposed that Parliament commence the necessary works without delay and at various places. He criticised the slowness of the northern railway so far – Parliament had approved the 25 miles to Forresters and as yet only 5 miles had been let. He thought the route through Forresters passed through better country than an extension from Kapunda. The line to Farrell’s Flat and then to Redruth would be most beneficial to the colony because it could be extended to the Murray – an easy extension because except for two or three miles the country was flat.</p>
<p>Mr Woollacott seconded the motion. He said 600,000 acres had been sold along the line of the proposed railway and yet not £10,000 from that had been spent by the Government north of Forresters – rather it had been squandered on roads and fine buildings about Adelaide and down south. Last season 1,000,000 bushels of wheat had been produced north of Forresters and that could more than double if there was a railway. He predicted more people employed at the mine and in Burra than ever before. When times were prosperous he himself had paid away £12,000 a year in carriage. Carriage from Burra to Adelaide by drays would not pay so well as formerly because the land was all fenced and depasturing cattle on Crown Lands was now impossible. He too complained of the slow progress of the line north from Roseworthy. The motion was passed unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr Rosman moved that the meeting adopt the memorial being signed at Kooringa. Mr Bath seconded that and it also passed unanimously.</p>

<p>Heavy rain began on Saturday and lasted till Wednesday morning 19 June.</p>
<p>Last Thursday Mr Smelt, a former teacher near Adelaide and afterwards at Burra, left Fingerpost Run with a flock of sheep for World’s End Station. He has not been heard of since and in this bad weather fears were held for his safety. A strict search failed to find him. The roads are virtually impassable.</p>
<p>Editor: since receiving the above report a telegram has arrived from the correspondent saying Smelt arrived at World’s End Run on Tuesday evening, having lost his way.</p>
<p>William Yahn, a miner placed an axe on the roof of his pigsty, so as to be out of the reach of his children. The son of William Hocking, a fruiterer, climbed up and got it down. He then told Yahn’s son to place his foot on a stool and then chopped off two of his toes, saying: ‘There I owed you that.’ Medical assistance was obtained and the toes were re-attached, but with what success only time will tell.</p>
<p>Obituary. A son of Mr Rogers of Gum Creek aged 19, who was a strong athletic young man, took cold and died after a fortnight’s illness. [William Rogers died 14 June 1867 at Gum Creek aged 19. He was probably born 4 May 1848 to Richard and Ann nee Bennetts, as two siblings were born at Gum Creek.]</p>
<p>Obituary. Michael Stephens, an old miner has died. [Michael Stevens died 17 June 1867 at Kooringa aged 53. BISA says he was Michael Stephens born about 1815 in Devonshire and arrived in SA in 1855.]</p>
<p>After a long period without water the Burra Creek has been flowing and is interfering with jigging operations to extract ore from the waste sand. The recovered ore is averaging 191⁄2%.</p>
<p>The guarantee of the promoters of the Burra Grammar School has now expired. Three years ago thirty persons guaranteed 12 guineas a year to start the school under Rev. L.W. Stanton MA, who was brought from England to superintend it. The scheme has been a failure, though Mr Stanton’s services have been secured for a further six months on a smaller guarantee. It is unfortunate that a superior school under a thoroughly efficient teacher should go down for want of support.</p>

<p>Railway Meeting at Chinkford [Chingford - later Manoora]</p>
<p>A large crowd assembled in poor weather on 19 June in the barn of Jabez Frost, Park Mill, to consider the proposal for a railway from Forresters to Burra. Arthur Colemann JP was voted to the chair.</p>
<p>[As might be expected the arguments here were somewhat different in emphasis from those at Burra. Here the chief argument was that the appalling roads meant they could not get produce to markets. And cartage costs were too high. Poor roads meant cartage had to be done when possible and not when the market was at its most favourable – cartage took as much as 25% of the value of produce.]</p>
<p>The first resolution said the line was most desirable.</p>
<p>The second stated that the general depression in the north and the great surplus of labour was chiefly caused by the high transport costs, which the railway would remedy, making it highly desirable that it be constructed immediately.</p>
<p>The third resolution urged the benefits of building it in various places simultaneously.</p>
<p>The fourth resolution urged that the Forresters-Kooringa line take precedence over all others.</p>
<p>The final motion called for the adoption of a memorial similar to that sent from Burra.</p>
<p>All were passed without dissent. [Much more detail is reported.]</p>
<p>26 June 1867, page 3</p>
<p>Railway Meeting at Mintaro</p>
<p>The meeting took place at the Devonshire Hotel on 17 June. Mr Thomas Priest took the chair.</p>
<p>[The arguments are already well noted. The emphasis that distinguished Mintaro concerned the reliance of farmers in that area on Burra as a market and therefore they were most seriously affected by the stoppage of the Burra Mine. This was stressed in a speech by W.H. Rosman Jnr.</p>
<p>Mr George Faulkner said: ‘Many like himself had got what he had mainly through having a good market at the Burra.’</p>
<p>The first resolution said the line from Forresters to Kooringa was extremely desirable.</p>
<p>The second resolution said that as the great surplus of labour in the colony was mainly owing to the high cost of transport and low prices for produce, and given that the railway would in great measure remedy this, it should be proceeded with at once.</p>
<p>The third resolution said that as a great calamity had overtaken the colony and particularly the northern areas, the Government was urged to mitigate that evil by the immediate construction of the proposed railway.</p>
<p>The fourth resolution urged construction simultaneously at various points along the route.</p>
<p>The resolutions all passed without dissent.</p>
<p>The petition to the House of Assembly was then read and procedural matters agreed to.</p>
<p>[Much more detail is presented.]</p>

<p>A run up to the dry country</p>
<p>Beyond the rainfall country everything is new and strange except to very few persons.</p>
<p>Squatting on the inside of the line is easy and profitable. Settlers live like gentlemen and see a yearly accumulating balance at their bankers. On the other side it is all hard work, unceasing toil, meagre fare and disappointed hopes with pecuniary losses. Between the ‘up’ squatters and the ‘down’ squatters there is a great gulf. Beyond the line when rain comes they come from the northeast, but south of it they come from the southwest.</p>
<p>On Saturday 22 June I was deputed by the proprietors of the Register and the Observer to attend a meeting of settlers at Tetulpa [sic: Teetulpa], a station belonging to Mr Chewings about 211 miles from Adelaide. I took the train to Kapunda and then the North-eastern Mail. It had rained in the north and the mail from the country beyond Mt Remarkable was two days late in reaching Burra and many hair-raising stories were told of its journey, including the abandonment of the coach and the mail guard having to swim with the bags.</p>
<p>At about 10 o’clock the coach left Kapunda for Burra. The road, though being improved, was sloppy and sticky. We passed through the ‘towns’ of Hamilton, Marrabel, Steelton, Waterloo and Black Springs. Burra was reached in good time and I was comfortably lodged at Lamb’s Hotel [Burra Hotel].</p>
<p>Because of the bad roads beyond we had to start at 5 a.m. ‘Tom Colley’ was on the box and we set off. We stopped for breakfast at Mt Bryan Inn for 15 minutes. The Cobb &amp; Co. vehicle was comfortable and travelled easily – a great improvement on the square box with heavy springs formerly in use. We made it to the end of the stage at a gallop. Not twenty yards beyond the changeover we were buried to the axletree in mud and only with great difficulty extracted. Once on firm land again we travelled at ten miles per hour to Gottlieb’s Wells, Mr A. McCulloch’s Station, right on the boundary of the rainy and dry country. There was half an hour to change horses. The country was becoming generally poorer, with less feed and more bare patches showing themselves.</p>
<p>We were told here that in June 1866 McCulloch’s run was as red as a brick, but now there is a green and cheerful look to it. The next stop was at G. Williams’s run of Parnaroo. Here there was a delay to effect repairs to the coach. The last stage for the day was a long run of 30 miles to Paratoo. This was through saltbush country – much of it dead after the long drought. Though the new growth was patchy, I was assured that the change from last year was marvellous. To speak of agriculture here would be fanciful. Surface water was temporarily plentiful, but survival relies entirely on water from wells and here they are deep and expensive; 100 or 250 feet or even 300 feet and the water drawn by horse power. Paratoo is the head station for the Pandappa and Paratoo runs of Mr Peter Waite and where he lives. I was greeted by Mr Waite and taken for a ride across his run the next morning. To me the country seemed miserable beyond description, but he spoke enthusiastically of the improved state of the run since 1866.</p>
<p>We had a ride of 18 miles to Tetulpa where the meeting of squatters that I had been sent to cover was to be held. After the meeting we returned to Paratoo shortly after dark.</p>
<p>At 5 a.m. on Wednesday I took the mail coach to head back to Adelaide. The bush roads in this dry country are generally excellent, though the speed required by the mail service means the coach provides painful thumps and bumps which the traveller will feel for days. I arrived back in the city by 3 p.m. Thursday.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 26 June</p>
<p>A man calling himself William Cummings came to Burra last week and began placing very large orders for a station that he said lay 180 miles beyond the Barrier Ranges. The orders were consistent with those needed to establish a large new head station, but no money changed hands. He then vanished, leaving storekeepers with made up orders ready for collection, but as no goods had been taken he had committed no crime by his lark.</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodists at Redruth celebrated their Sunday-school Anniversary on 23 &amp; 24 June. It was a great success. Rev. Jarrett preached. Collections were larger than at the previous Anniversary.</p>
<p>Midwinter was a Mine holiday and was duly celebrated by the firing of cannons, burning of tat-barrels and the making of bonfires.</p>
<p>The working men are complaining bitterly about the low wages for making the new road to Adelaide. They say that 15/- a week is as much as can be earned. Many are still out of work and many workless men are arriving from the bush. Applications for rations will soon be made to the Government to avert starvation.</p>
<p>Hopes are still held that a company will be formed to work Princess Royal Mine. If a little capital were raised 200 men could be employed. About 40 tons of ore, said to average 20%, are at grass and the fourteen men there now are expected to raise 60 tons this take.</p>

<p>Meeting of the Unemployed at Kooringa</p>
<p>On Saturday 6 July a meeting of the unemployed took place at the Burra Hotel, Kooringa. Speakers were exclusively working men. About 300 were present. A major complaint was that contractors who had tendered for work at a fair price were now paying their labourers a pittance.</p>
<p>W. Brooks of Hampton was voted into the chair.</p>
<p>He said the general depression of the colony combined with the stoppage of underground operations at the Burra Mine had thrown many people out of work who were now in want of the bare necessities of life. Distress at the present time was fearful. Even when work could be found it was often so poorly paid it barely fed the labourer and did not sustain a family.</p>
<p>The first motion by Mr John Young: ‘That this meeting views with deep regret the present unsatisfactory condition of the labour market by means of which large numbers of men are unable to find employment and are with their families thereby placed in a condition of great distress.’ William Cullen seconded and it was carried unanimously.</p>
<p>P. Murphy moved: ‘That in the opinion of this meeting it is desirable that the Government should borrow money for the construction of reproductive works, and that it is highly necessary that immigration should for some time to come be stopped and Sutherland’s Act repealed, thereby setting at liberty the whole Land Fund for public works purposes.’ He said all this distress had been caused by the Government introducing migrants whilst there was no employment for them. At the next election no candidate should receive support who supported immigration. Mr Bennett seconded.</p>
<p>R.H. Cook spoke in support. He said many had migrated to the sister colony and more would do so if they could pay the transit expenses. There was no inducement to stay in Burra. Even now there was a shipload of migrants on the water to add to the unemployed. The resolution was carried.</p>
<p>Mr George Shorter proposed a motion that it was the Government’s duty to push forward public works to furnish employment for the working classes, many of whom had been encouraged to come to the colony because of statements made concerning the better position of workers in SA. He said it was not widely known that many were living on dry bread and suffering greatly, yet kept their plight secret. Rather than depend on the scant provisions of the Destitute Board they would approach death.</p>
<p>G. Townsend seconded the motion and said he had lately read with disgust a letter from the Chairman of the Destitute Asylum saying that destitution was not as great as had been represented. One source of destitution originated from the road contractors who screwed wages so low that their workers could not actually live.</p>
<p>John Vivian, assistant bailiff, spoke in support. His occupation caused him to witness scenes of the greatest distress and poverty. Many a poor child had to stay in bed while its mother washed the rags that covered it.</p>
<p>W.H. Bennetts said that for the last three years at the Burra Mine his wages had not averaged £1 a week and in the last six weeks working there they were but 9.6 a week. He had a wife and four children and had not earned a penny in the last five months. He would have travelled to seek work, but what was the use when those who had done so had returned without finding any. On the Roseworthy-Forresters railway some had come back with 29 or 30 shillings after five weeks’ work.</p>
<p>Joseph Richardson supported this, saying he had worked on the line from 6.45 a.m. till dusk and could not get better than 3/1 a day.</p>
<p>Mr Joseph Beaglehole corroborated that and said it was impossible to support a family on the wages paid for railway construction.</p>
<p>John Sampson Jnr moved: ‘That the present system of letting contracts is open to grave objections and should be discontinued, as men seldom earn sufficient to procure the common necessities of life, and often lose their wages entirely, while the contractor reaps enormous profits, owing to the desperate circumstances in which a man is placed in a time like the present.’</p>
<p>He also spoke against immigration at this time.</p>
<p>Mr Pearce seconded the motion and said the Government was liberal with the contractors, but ought to be fair to the men and see them paid properly for their labour. Work should be let on small bargains to parties of miners.</p>
<p>Mr Pollard supported the resolution, which passed unanimously.</p>
<p>22 July 1867, page 2</p>
<p>Percy W. Dyer writes:</p>
<p>On Saturday 8 June Messrs Bright and Everard visited the place to acquaint themselves with the needs of the district. A deputation waited on them, stressing the need for employment and they said they had just driven through the town to Redruth and had given instructions for a bridge to be built near the Mine Store. [The Mine Bridge.] And for a channel to be cut on the side of Commercial Street. On the following morning four or five men were seen preparing the channel, ready for paving. Several loads of stone were thrown down along the road. In a few days all action stopped and nothing more has been done, except to increase the heap of stone along the road. This is a scandalous way to treat starving men as well as an inconvenience to the tradesmen of the town. I do not know if the fault lies with the Board or with Surveyor Macaulay, but something is radically wrong for men to be waiting five weeks for something to be done.</p>

<p>[Obituary] August Fischer died 8 December 1866. He had been drinking freely at the Miners’ Arms, Kooringa, on the night of 8 December 1866 where he stayed the night and was found dead in the morning. A native of Prussia, he had been a miner at the Burra Mine for about 12 years. He was of intemperate habits with no known relations in the colony.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 31 July</p>
<p>Inquest/Obituary. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms on Monday 29 July into the death of a miner, John Mitchell. He was reported to have fallen down in a fit while drinking in Mr Richards’ spirit cellar in Kooringa. The examining doctor concluded death was due to apoplexy, but public opinion demanded an inquest. Mr MacDermott presided with Mr John Roberts as foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Richard Collins: saw deceased 3 to 4 p.m. at Killicoat’s Corner – he then seemed sober.</p>
<p>James Richards: saw deceased briefly in the cellar – deceased then went away, but returned in a few minutes, falling down the cellar steps. Mr Richards and Thomas Killicoat were present and rendered assistance. Deceased was able to rise, but not to speak. When he failed to improve he was taken home in a cart.</p>
<p>Witness said he was not drunk and he did not see him have anything to drink in the cellar.</p>
<p>Dr W.H. Dashwood: was sent for at midnight on Saturday, but was not at home and did not see deceased until 5 a.m. Sunday. He was then lying on his back unconscious. He appeared to have had an apoplectic fit. There were no bruises or signs of violence and he believed the fall to be a consequence of the fit. Thought him a likely person to suffer apoplexy, having treated him frequently for headaches and bilious attacks.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of ‘Died by the visitation of God.’</p>

<p>Some sheep farmers dear that scab has been introduced by sheep travelling from Wellington, though so far no actual case has been reported. There is a flock at Anlaby afflicted with Coast Disease and they have been detained for ten days to ensure they are not infected with scab.</p>
<p>The election was rather more exciting in Burra than is usual. Mr Crozier’s committee was active and so were speakers for the other candidates.</p>
<p>Princess Royal Mine continues to attract interest. Sixty tons of ore are at the Smelting Works – principally the produce of 15 men who raised it in the last ‘take’ of two months.</p>
<p>At the Burra Mine about 220 men are at work.</p>

<p>The Cartapo Mining Co. has in its office in Adelaide a number of cakes of an alloy of copper and cobalt from their mine about 15 miles north of Burra. About 6 tons of ore was smelted to yield 14-15 cwt of the alloy. The ingots are supposed to be 50-55% copper and about 45% cobalt. Some is presently being assayed. A cake will be sent to England for the cobalt to be extracted by the wet process.</p>

<p>A Meeting of the Unemployed was held in Victoria Square in Adelaide on 19 August to receive the report of the deputation that had waited upon the Government on Monday. Some 800 to 1,000 were present.</p>
<p>Mr W. Collings was elected to preside.</p>
<p>The Government had assured them it was doing its best to push forward public works. The Chief Secretary had said that about the end of the week there would be contractors ready to give them work. The deputation had tried to impress upon the Chief Secretary the necessity of the contractors giving a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. He had intimated that the men could not live for less than 6/- per day. The Chief Secretary denied any responsibility for the price of labour ‘the men must make the best bargain they can with them’.</p>
<p>‘He believed that gentleman [Mr Ayers] had said to them that the Burra Mine would not have been stopped if the men could have worked for 4/- a day; but he did not say also that he had the conscience to offer it, because he knew they could not live upon it. It was their duty to meet the men half way – do with half their dividends and pay them more for their labour.’</p>
<p>The papers reported that the miners at Moonta had passed a resolution which in effect prevented them from making known their grievances and shut their mouths. He considered that a disgrace to them.</p>
<p>The Chief Secretary said the best thing they could do would be to form small groups and take up small contracts for themselves without having to work under a contractor.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzgibbon said that was said just to get rid of them. Hoe could working men prepare plans and specifications for contracts as professionals?</p>
<p>Mr Collings though the Chief Secretary’s suggestion a good one.</p>
<p>A vote of censure on the Government was carried with three groans.</p>
<p>The meeting dispersed without any definite procedure being decided upon.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 21 August</p>
<p>Accident. On 21 August an accident occurred on the macadamised road half way between the telegraph station and the Mine Store. Mrs John Pearce and Mrs John Symons were in a spring cart driving towards Kooringa. Mr Armstrong of Booborowie was coming the other way in a two-horse American trap. When Mrs Pearce tried to pass on the wrong side of the road her horse shied and started up the hill, overturning the cart. The occupants escaped with some rather severe grazes and a good shaking.</p>
<p>Surveyors have been busy the last few days, surveying the line of the contemplated railway.</p>
<p>The Cartapo cobalt discovery is being worked energetically. William Davey has been appointed agent and is to go at once to the mine with eight miners to raise 100 tons of ore, which is to be sent to England as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The new mine found by Mr Patrick Murphy is also looking promising.</p>
<p>The Princess Royal Mine has recently been inspected by Captain Matthew Bryant. Some of the ore has proved less rich than expected and this has caused dissatisfaction among the tributers. But there is still some fine ore waiting at the Smelting Works.</p>
<p>A disturbance occurred recently between some men employed in building a stone wall around a portion of Dr Browne’s Booborowie Run. There was a fight between a party of Irishmen and a party of Cornishmen, in which the Cornishmen were worsted. It is likely to end up before the Local Court.</p>

<p>Henry Mason wrote from White’s Forest complaining of the miserable and dilapidated condition of his schoolhouse and appealing for funds to help towards repairs. Since the closure of the Burra Mines the people were very poor and many without employment. Many with large families were quite unable to pay school fees.</p>
<p>The Board said that regrettably they had no funds for such purposes and could only suggest he appeal to gentlemen whose local interests might induce them to assist.</p>
<p>[White’s Forest is not known with any certainty, but Manning in Place names of South Australia, November 2006 says it was probably near Wirrabara.]</p>

<p>Mr R. Alexander, in proposing a toast at Yankalilla on 29 August in connection with a ploughing match, made the point that the colony of SA would make more progress in mining if the regulations were changed. At present a man wanting a licence to mine had to pay £40 in instalments before he could remove any ore at grass. It would make more sense – as in South America – for the Government to impose a royalty of say 2%. As it is there are many heaps of ore at grass that will not move because the miner cannot pay the £40.</p>
<p>August 1867</p>
<p>Throughout the month there was a series of letters arguing that labourers’ wages were too low to exist on and a series countering that and asserting that it was high wages that had resulted in the men not being employed.</p>

<p>Cartapo Cobalt Mine</p>
<p>Results of samples of smelted allot from Cartapo ores average 26.29% cobalt and 69.72% copper.</p>
<p>The report of Mr Francis says the patent process used offers the mining world a means of smelting low grade copper ores and offers a better process than any wet or acid process. The resulting alloy can be treated with suitable acids and reagents to separate the copper and cobalt metals or their oxides and salts. The main use for cobalt at present is in smalts [i.e. glass] for giving the beautiful blue colour to glass, china and earthenware, but there are many other potential uses. William Davey has been appointed Captain of the Mine. He reports raising good ores from both the north and south levels. They have also opened new workings. There are about 19 bags of ore at the mine. The Directors intend to continue raising ore, but before anymore smelting is done, they will await the results from ores shipped to England. If the results warrant it they will erect smelting works on or near the mine to make the alloy and so reduce freight costs if the ore had to be sent.</p>

<p>Kooringa News, 17 September</p>
<p>Obituary. Mrs Diana Bagg was found dead in her bed on Sunday morning 15 September. An inquest was held before Mr MacDermott SM.</p>
<p>Bennett Smith said he lived next door to the deceased and saw her between 5 &amp; 6 p.m. on Friday, crossing the footbridge near the Anti-Butchers with a little firewood in her hand. Never saw her other than sober.</p>
<p>She lived alone and no one saw her Saturday and not seeing her door open Saturday or Sunday morning, the neighbours notified the police.</p>
<p>Police-trooper John Carley found the deceased lying on the bed fully dressed with one foot on the floor and her boots off. Under the bed was a bottle with a little brandy and another with some beer. The house had plenty of food in it.</p>
<p>Dr Dashwood saw the deceased about 3 p.m. Sunday, by which time she had been dead at least 24 hours. He smelt no odour in the mouth to suggest drunkenness. She seems to have died while dressing in the morning. After an autopsy he had concluded from the condition of the brain that the cause of death was a fit of epilepsy and the jury returned a verdict of death by natural causes.</p>
<p>[Diana Rebecca Bagg died 14 September 1867 at Kooringa aged 45. Her husband was John Bagg (born c. 1807) and they were married 17 July 1854 at Kooringa. At that time she was a widow and said she was three years younger than the age at death would suggest. BISA research says she was born Scott and gives Seymour as an alias, perhaps suggesting that was her first marriage or even a de facto relationship. On her marriage to Bagg she used the name Scott and her father’s name is not recorded. BISA also says her husband was John Diment Bagg and that he died in Dorset UK 29 March 1891. The couple had two daughters; one in 1853 and the other in 1860.]</p>
<p>Last Wednesday 11 September about 40 people in eleven conveyances set out in wind and rain from the Wesleyan Church for a tea meeting some 35 miles away on Mr George Hiles’ Munjibbie Station. All present enjoyed the outing very much, but on the homeward journey next day Mr William Pearce was thrown over the splashboard while getting into his vehicle while it was in motion. He broke his leg near the ankle and is progressing under the care of Dr Dashwood. The object of the meeting was to raise money for the ministry.</p>

<p>The Royal Visit</p>
<p>On Saturday 21 September a large part of Gawler’s population turned out to construct a huge bonfire on Flagstaff Hill to be lit on the arrival of the Prince. It is estimated that some 60 tons of wood were heaped together and saturated with kerosene and tar in preparation.</p>
<p>Tothill’s Creek News</p>
<p>With the new Government main road passing through Steelton and Waterloo the Central Road Board has abandoned the care of the old main road from Springfield through Tothill’s Creek and Apoinga to Kooringa. A public meeting has been called for some repairs on the old road and for a ford on the section between Springfield and Tothill’s Creek to be made free for general traffic; it having for some reason been sold to Mr Ryan. This latter application has been granted.</p>

<p>Burra News, 25 September</p>
<p>Princess Royal ore has not turned out as well as anticipated. A crusher and other machinery are really needed to prepare it for smelting. Hand-dressed ore has been between 201⁄2 and 25%.</p>
<p>At the Burra Mine the ore dressing in the creek is progressing well. The present ‘take’ ends on 26 September and will yield 500 tons of 15% and another 100 tons of about 16% will be got from the halvins around the Mine. About 230 men and boys are employed and this could go on for years. The proceeds from this ore will pay all expenses – fuel for the engine, wages, shaft expenses, sinking Graves’ Engine Shaft and salaries, and leave a surplus. All this from merely washing what was until recently considered useless. There are other places in the Mine where ore can be obtained at trifling cost, such as from the lobby leading into Beck’s Workings. Many would take work there at a low tribute and their labour would add to the surplus referred to.</p>
<p>We are anxiously expecting the Bill for the railway extension beyond Forresters to be brought forward.</p>
<p>On faith in the railway line being constructed some large portions of land between Kooringa and Mt Bryan and between Burra and Gum Creek are being ploughed.</p>

<p>The Old Burra Road</p>
<p>Mr Neales moved for a sum not exceeding £2,000 for repairing the Tothill’s Creek-Burra Road. He said it was still largely used.</p>
<p>The Treasurer said the Government could not support such a request.</p>
<p>Mr McCulloch said there was not a more wretched piece of road anywhere. In October 1863 no less than 40 drays, for the most part loaded with wool had bee stopped for nine days on account of its bad condition.</p>
<p>Mr Coglin &amp; Hon. W. Milne spoke in support.</p>
<p>Mr Bright said the reason for the condition was the large traffic by the Copper Company’s drays. He thought the people in the district needed to form one or two District Councils and that would be the way to attend to the road, the main line of road now having been shifted. The vote was lost 16 to 6.</p>

<p>Mrs Elizabeth Ann Hooper lost about £9 and suspecting it was in the home of Mary Davey, she got a search warrant for Mr Davey’s premises. While the police were searching the home Mrs Davey went to Mrs Hooper and insisted she come and witness the process.

Mary Davey was sentenced to four month’s imprisonment for the offence. She has six young children and a sick husband and the youngest child is still at breast. She was allowed to take it to gaol with her.</p>

<p>Width of Tires Act</p>
<p>At the last meeting of the central Road Board Mr Everard drew attention once again to the need for a measure to prevent the wholesale destruction of roads by the carrying of heavy loads on narrow wheels. He hoped an attempt would be made in the House of Assembly to reintroduce the Width of Tires Bill.</p>
<p>Such a Bill was passed in 1865 by the House, but thrown out by the Upper House. It was intended to prevent carters from carrying more than 8 cwt for every inch of tire.</p>

<p>The half-yearly meeting of the Association was held at their office on 16 October. As indicated by the Directors in April the operations at the Burra Mine have been confined to keeping water out of the principal workings, to sinking Graves’ Engine shaft, which is now at 38 fathoms and to dressing halvins and creek ore. It was hoped the income attendant thereon would meet all expenses and it is now believed that such will be the case for the last six months. The works throughout the area are in a satisfactory condition and the employment is:</p>

<p>The railway now looks like a certainty and all are of the opinion that it will repay the outlay. Vigorous efforts will be made to have the work commence at either end and at various other places. Miners will work for less when near their homes and families and this should favour work starting at Burra and be a real boon for the labouring population.</p>

<p>Frederick Houghton was committed for trial on 2 November on a charge of stealing a horse belonging to James Williams. The prisoner was a cook on Mr Cooper’s Run. On 16 October he came into Burra and took a horse from near the pound. He rode it to the Pig &amp; Whistle from where he stole a saddle and bridle. He was arrested at Blanchetown by Police-trooper Ewins.</p>
<p>The morning HRH arrived was marked by rejoicing among the inhabitants. Captain Killicoat was informed at 6 a.m. and the Smelting Works bell was rung for an hour, awakening the inhabitants of Kooringa, Redruth, Copperhouse and the other townships to the fact. Flags were raised at the Works, the Telegraph Office, Drew &amp; Co.’s and most other principal buildings in Kooringa, though this was not the case in Redruth either at the Gaol, the Police station or the Court House. Schools were closed for periods varying from three to fifteen days. In the evening the bonfire blazed on the Mine Hill and fireworks were let off. At Redruth some pretty rockets donated by Mrs Branch were discharged from the bridge. On Wednesday at 9 a.m. a special mail conveyance was well filled with people anxious to see the procession [in Adelaide]. Thursday was observed as a public holiday.</p>
<p>Three informations were laid today under the Bush Fires Act against carters for failing to clear an area of ten feet around their camp fires.</p>

<p>Arson. At about 3 p.m. on Sunday 10 November a man was seen near Cobb &amp; Co.’s paddock on the Mt Bryan Road. A quarter of an hour later the grass where he had been was alight. A few people extinguished it and found at its origin a candle, some paper and dry grass. The wheat around was green and confined the fire to Messrs Hallett’s Run. Only the greenness of the growth prevented the fire from causing serious mischief and allowed residents to get it out. An inquest will be held.</p>

<p>An inquest was held at the residence of Mr Richard Hallett, Wandillah, near Kooringa, before Mr MacDermott SM into the fire in Cobb &amp; Co.’s paddock on 10 November.</p>
<p>William Nottle: was employed mowing wheat for Cobb &amp; Co. and saw a man leaving the source of the fire. Saw the fire half an hour after in the corner near Mr Hallett’s Run. It was extinguished before I got there. Discovered at its source a piece of paper, the nearly burnt wick of a tallow candle and some green wheat recently pulled up, forming a windbreak for the candle.</p>
<p>James McEwen gardener at Mr Hallett’s corroborated the above and so did other witnesses, though only Nottle had seen a man in the area. The jury concluded the fire had been maliciously lit by a person or persons unknown.</p>
<p>At Redruth Gaol on 11 November an extra allowance of rations was given out in honour of the royal visit. A visitor could not help noticing the extreme cleanliness and good order prevailing there and that much of the credit is due to the gaoler Mr Perry, who is an old colonist, having arrived on the second ship.</p>
<p>Monday was a public holiday in honour of the Prince of Wales’ birthday, but no public amusements were got up.</p>

<p>State of the Crops</p>
<p>Mr A.H. Forder of Kooringa says red rust is not perceptible, but black rust or blight is present in a few patches. Not much loss is anticipated and the average yield should be 10 to 12 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>On 10 November a bushfire was discovered in Cobb &amp; Co.’s paddock apparently intentionally lit by a candle with the intention of setting fire to Mr Hallett’s Run. Fortunately it was soon extinguished. Tracks through the green feed were followed in the direction of Firewood creek and then lost. On 18 November a reliable gentleman saw the grass alight on the western side of Mr Hallett’s Run. A man on a bay horse was seen to ride away towards Black Waterholes or Firewood Creek. A man and a boy in a cart were able to extinguish this fire. On 23 November another portion of Mr Hallett’s Run was found to be alight. This time ten or twelve square miles of feed were destroyed – mostly on Hallett’s Run, but some 800 acres on the property of Mr Robert Stevens of Princess Royal. A second inquest was held at Redruth Court House on 26 November. Mr Henry Hallett, who is unfortunately deaf and dumb, gave evidence: am brother to Mr R. Hallett the manager of Wandillah Run. Last Saturday on the way to Caroona saw smoke about two miles distant. Went to it and began beating out the fire and in about half an hour plenty of assistance came. Am of the opinion it was deliberately lit. Had assistance not come all Gebhardt’s Run would have been consumed. While present at this fire another broke out on the flat.</p>
<p>[Evidence from Henry Lawn, employed by Mr Robert Stevens gave further details, but did not offer any clue to the arsonist and neither did the evidence of Richard Reed sheep farmer.]</p>
<p>The jury could come to no conclusion as to the cause of the fire from the evidence tendered.</p>
<p>A man in a half drunken state was seen driving his cart along the Mt Bryant Road [sic] on Saturday 23 November and was seen to light his pipe and throw the match away, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished by nearby workers. When questioned by them he denied smoking and abused them roundly, but then forgot his statement, pulled out his pipe and repeated the process. This action is not covered by the Bush Fires Act and the only remedy is civil action.</p>
<p>Obituary. Anthony Evans died at Llwchwr near Redruth on 23 November aged 104, in the house of his daughter Mrs Edwards. He was born at Llanelly in South Wales on his father’s farm, where he worked until he was 24. He then married and worked then at a furnace in the smelting works at Llanelly for 28 years. He then moved to Swansea and continued to work there at the smelters until aged 85. At that time his daughters, Mrs Edwards and Mrs Morris of Port Adelaide, with their husbands and families, being employed by the English &amp; Australian Copper Company to come to SA, brought him with them, with the consent and assistance of the company. On his arrival he obtained employment at the Smelting Works as a watchman for 22/- a week. He held the appointment at a reduced wage until his 98th year. Being then unable to do much walking he retired and the company paid him 15/- a week until he died. Had she survived his eldest daughter would have been nearly 80 and the youngest is about 50. His wife died when he was 65, so he has been a widower for almost 40 years. At the time of his death he had 118 descendents. He was a man of very regular habits and drank no intoxicating beverages except sparingly of ale and beer. He took care to vote at each election. He died quietly at breakfast time, expiring before Dr Dashwood arrived.</p>
<p>Samuel Trevena was fined £2-10-0 plus £1 costs for assaulting Police-trooper McKenzie while in the execution of his duties. Last week McKenzie stopped Trevena for furious riding at about 9 p.m. Trevena refused to give his name and the policeman refused to let go the rein and a scuffle ensued. McKenzie also said several of Trevena’s friends also intervened, but could not be identified in the darkness.</p>

<p>On 4 December a poor widow who makes a living by affording food and shelter to wandering bushmen was charged with keeping a disorderly house. It seems that one night two or three men returned to her house ‘the worse for beer’ and sang a song or two. Mr MacDermott considered the charge proved and fined her 10/- or a week in gaol. A Samaritan kindly paid the fine for her to spare her imprisonment.</p>

<p>Burra News, 25 December</p>
<p>Thursday 19 December was the hottest day for the season with a searing northerly wind and clouds of dust. Numerous bushfires surrounded the town, filling the air with smoke. For some hours burnt grass fell from the sky and accumulated in sheltered corners.</p>
<p>The largest fire started 30 miles from Mt Remarkable and travelled down through Mannanarie, touching Woorkoongoree, Gottlieb’s Wells, Canowie and Booborowie. The fire travelled 40 miles in six hours. Fire fighting efforts met with little success.</p>
<p>Another fire southwest of Kooringa broke out at midday on Bown’s at Springbank and rapidly ran up the hills, crossed the ranges and got into Need’s paddock. Mrs Need tried to save some sheep, but got caught by the fire, barely escaping with a burnt arm. In the meantime the fire had reached the house. The furniture was removed to the Government Road, but the house was eventually saved, though some dry creepers burnt over the roof. They lost five pigs, 70 fowls and 25 acres of wheat and a new haystack. The fire then spread to Mr Porter’s paddock and all his feed on the eastern side of the ranges was consumed. A friend rode to warn Mr Flowers and Mr Humphries, seven miles away, but the fire outpaced him. Flowers’ Run is greatly injured and Humphries’ all but burnt out. Amazingly a haystack of Mr Flowers, protected by a low stone wall, survived.</p>
<p>The cause, uncovered by an inquest on Friday, was almost certainly someone carelessly throwing out ashes at Bown’s.</p>
<p>At the inquest Richard Bosence gave evidence of its origin at Bown’s when only Mrs Mrs Bown was present. The wind was strong from the northwest. He said he had often cautioned Mrs Bown about carrying hot ashes out to the ash heap.</p>
<p>John Bagg gave corroborative evidence.</p>
<p>George Townsend thought the fire started from ashes carelessly thrown out during a boisterous wind.</p>
<p>The jury decided the fire started from the ash heap referred to through the carelessness of some unknown inmate of John Bown’s house.</p>
<p>On Sunday 22 December another fire at Stony Gap burnt a good deal of grass of Messrs Duffield &amp; Porter.</p>
<p>Shell parrots are in the neighbourhood in immense numbers.</p>

<p>A sheep farmer less that 50 miles away, hearing about the amount of distress in the area, generously offered 25 fat sheep to be distributed as a New Year’s treat. In response a committee was formed and about £20 collected. As a result this morning about 55 families were furnished with a good supply of mutton and groceries. The general ration per family was:</p>
<p>1⁄2 sheep</p>
<p>10 lb flour</p>
<p>7 lb potatoes</p>
<p>1⁄2 lb tea</p>
<p>2 lb sugar</p>
<p>2 lb currants</p>
<p>1 lb raisins</p>
<p>2 oz candied peel</p>
<p>1 oz spice</p>

<p>A New Year’s Ball was held at the Burra Hotel.</p>
<p>Messrs Cobb &amp; Co had 250 acres of wheat in crop, most of it being cut for hay and 60 acres left for wheat. One patch of 10 acres yielded 65 bags and another 12 acres averaged 22 bushels per acre. Reaping is general now with no rust to speak of.</p>

<p>Fire. Last Thursday there was a fire at Booborowie, believed to be the work of incendiaries. Another on Friday between Mr Gebhardt’s Run and Mr Hallett’s was caused by a shepherd throwing out ashes. A third on Saturday between Booborowie and Gum Creek is believed to have been deliberately lit. The Bush Fire Act needs to be amended to cover fires caused by carelessness. At present only fires lit on purpose are covered.</p>

<p>The Christmas-New Year season saw few festivities this year. The only public amusements were provided by Rev. L.W. Stanton, assisted by other ladies and gentlemen. (Readings, songs and music.)</p>
<p>Though there are but few farmers in the immediate district, those have had a good year. On the new land taken up at Gum Creek, Mr Bryan Flat, Springbank Flat, the Little Plain, Tothill’s Creek and Springbank, the yields are about 23 bushels per acre and on old land about 20 bushels. It is a matter of regret that so little land about the neighbourhood is under cultivation and it is to be hoped that soon the plains around will be dotted with farmers’ homesteads. The haystacks of Cobb &amp; Co.’s paddocks are a splendid example of what Burra land will produce.</p>
<p>The Local Court heard a cross-information case today in which Mrs Hodge and Mrs Vincent accused each other of assault over some misunderstanding about a fowl. Mrs Hodge swore Mrs Vincent threw a stone at her and then ran and pulled her to the ground and assaulted her for ten minutes. She appeared, however, to have escaped serious injury. Mrs Vincent on the other hand was black all around the eyes, her eyes were bloodshot, her cheeks were black and blue and her limbs were stiff. She described how Mrs Hodge had pulled her to the ground, taken her head in both hands and bumped it hard on the ground and then knelt on her stomach and with both hands battered her eyes. Witnesses supported Mrs Vincent. The parties were bound over to a Local Court of Full Jurisdiction on 30 January.</p>
<p>In a case of animal cruelty Joseph Williams was sentenced to 30 days in gaol. Mr Woollacott engaged him to drive two teams of bullocks from Pichi Richi to Burra, in company with Woollacott’s son, aged 14.</p>
<p>[This would appear to be William John Woollacott born 9 June 1852 and so 15 in the latter half of 1867.]</p>
<p>No time was specified, but eight days was mentioned. Williams did the journey in four days, but Mr Woollacott said it crippled the bullocks, making them useless for months. Williams blamed the boy for urging him on, but the lad denied it positively and swore that Williams had charge of the teams.</p>

<p>Cornish Miners have been leaving Moonta for other colonies, saying they cannot be worse off for leaving SA behind. Every departure has a bad effect on the tradesmen and many of the departed miners leave behind debt. Copper prices are low and so is the grade of ore being raised here compared with a few years ago. The mine is deeper and haulage and other costs are higher and as the shareholders expect the same dividends it is at the expense of wages and the departure of many of the best workers.</p>

<p>Public Education in 1867. Editorial.</p>
<p>There are 308 schools under the control of the Board of Education, an increase of 16 on 1866.</p>
<p>Most schools are in the country areas:</p>
<p>Adelaide and corporate towns 39</p>
<p>Country schools proper 231</p>
<p>Outlying or pastoral schools 38</p>
<p>The practice of the Board is to attach a certain amount of stipend to each grade of licence – the grade being determined by personal examination. Stipends range from £40 to £80. The average amount of private fees paid in 1866 was £1-1-51⁄2 per scholar. In Adelaide the average size of school was 69 and so the average income from private fees would be £74 and the average stipend from the Board was £52.</p>
<p>But it varies considerably with districts:</p>
<p>This is surely an anomalous situation. Where the parents can afford to pay more the subsidy is greater! The largest number in attendance at any time across the colony was 14,544, of whom 8,187 were boys and 6,357 were girls. Attendance averaged about 78%. The economic state of the colony is reflected in the number of destitute children:</p>
<p>In 1865 it was 934, in December 1866 it was 1,191 and now it is 1,365.</p>

<p>The ‘letting’ at the Burra Mine was better than for some time. Several pitches were let in the lobby at reduced prices, but sufficient to permit pretty fair wages. The creek continues to turn out the usual 400 to 500 tons per take, of 14% ore.</p>
<p>Even without the railway many are confident of the future prosperity of the Mine. The new [Graves’] shaft is down to 40 fathoms where a plat is being cut.</p>

<p>Much discussion locally concerns the possible location of the station.</p>
<p>In the Hiles v. Kronke case – arising out of an earlier case in which Mr Hiles was charged with an indecent assault on one of his shepherd’s wives – Mrs Kronke has been committed to the Supreme Court for perjury.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. On 2 March William Thomas aged 41⁄2 fell off the longitudinal beams of the ford near Aberdeen into the water and drowned. At the inquest his sister Mrs Mary Elder said that her mother had gone to sew at Mr Goodridge’s. Mrs Elder had sent the deceased and his little sister to the Mine Creek with dinner for her brothers, who were working there. The deceased on his return said that in the afternoon he had to go to a place near the creek to get some grapes from a little girl named Davey. She left the deceased playing outside his home some 200 yards from the creek and had told him not to leave, but when she returned half an hour later, he had gone. Not finding him, she raised the alarm. Lance Corporal Smith said they had searched till 1 a.m. and started again at dawn. They dragged the creek at 7.30 and found the deceased in a six-foot-deep hole close to the ford near Dunstan’s. The jury found that the deceased had drowned through accidentally falling into Burra Creek. [The birth does not appear to have been registered in SA.]</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Last Thursday all the bargains in the Creek were taken at the usual prices. Several pitches were let in what is called the lobby or surface workings on the side of the hill. Ore raised there in the last take is about 170 tons of 23%. On the whole the Mine is looking more lively and the ‘floors’ on the side of the hill are looking promising. Some think the Mine will show a profit for the last six months, after paying for sinking Graves’ Engine Shaft, driving crosscuts and executing other sundry works.</p>
<p>This would be better than last year’s report, which showed a £15,000 loss.</p>
<p>The talk is that given a railway line, Burra will again employ her thousand men and if scientifically worked will pay a dividend for generations. The new engine shaft is now below the 40 fathoms level. The total ore for the last take is estimated at 650 tons.</p>

<p>Arrangements for mail from the north and northeast of Burra have been improved. The northern mail leaves Kooringa at 5 p.m. Friday and by travelling by night it arrives at Blinman on Sunday at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>It leaves Blinman on Monday at 10 a.m. and reaches Burra at 4 a.m. on Wednesday, in time for despatch to Adelaide, which it reaches at 2.40 p.m.</p>
<p>Messrs MacDonald &amp; Hosking operate excellent Yankee traps fitted with five powerful lamps and their teams are in excellent condition.</p>
<p>Messrs Cobb &amp; Co. have also increased their rate of travel for their Outalpa contract, leaving Outalpa at 10.30 a.m. Monday and arriving in Kooringa at 6 p.m. Tuesday – without any night travelling.</p>
<p>‘Too much praise cannot be given to this firm for providing the commodious vehicles now running wherever their contracts extend north of Kapunda.’</p>
<p>Rev. W.S. Worth was presented with a purse of 20 sovereigns before he left Burra.</p>
<p>Splendid rains fell since Monday and green feed will soon replace that destroyed by fires.</p>
<p>Farmers are in good spirits and two additional sections on Mt Bryan Flat have been settled in the last month.</p>

<p>SA Mining Association</p>
<p>The Association’s AGM was held on 15 April.</p>
<p>Twelve to fourteen shareholders attended.</p>
<p>The 23rd Annual Report was taken as read.</p>
<p>During the past half year 1,746 tons of ore of an average 17% copper has been raised from new works near the surface.</p>
<p>The general operations of the Mine had included:</p>
<p>Pumping water from the workings.</p>
<p>Securing and renewing timber in various parts of the Mine.</p>
<p>Continuing to sink Graves’ Engine Shaft, which is now at 431⁄2 fathoms.</p>
<p>Linking Graves’ Engine Shaft to Graham’s at the 30 fathom level.</p>
<p>Stoping ore from near the surface has yielded 80-90 tons of good ore per month.</p>
<p>Dressing halvins and extracting ore from waste.</p>
<p>We are satisfied the produce so obtained will more than meet costs.</p>
<p>The number employed at the Mine is 278.</p>
<p>Some principal shareholders in Europe have recommended engaging an engineer will acquainted with the latest methods of working and the economic preparation of ores. They have such a person in mind and ask the Directors to engage him or such other competent person to determine the best system of working for the future. The Directors sent the necessary authority to engage him and should receive by the next mail when he is to arrive in this country.</p>
<p>The Directors also said the completion of the Burra Railway would greatly facilitate the operations of the company.</p>
<p>At September 30 1867 the ore at grass was 858 tons and since then 1,746 tons has been raised for a total of 2,604 tons.</p>
<p>Of this 1,825 tons has been delivered to the Smelting Co. and 779 tons remains at the Mine.</p>
<p>The stock of copper on hand at 30 September 1867 was 412 tons and since then 169 tons has been received, making 581 tons.</p>
<p>200 tons of this was exported to England, 98 tons sold and 183 tons are on hand.</p>
<p>The progress in Graves’ Engine shaft was slow in very hard ground. They hoped to be able to raise ore when it reached 60 or 70 fathoms.</p>
<p>The retiring Directors were re-elected. Arthur Blyth and T.G. Waterhouse were leaving SA and were replaced with Messrs Henry Rymill and Neville Blyth.</p>

<p>Election meeting for Burra District</p>
<p>[This meeting is reported in a very long article of no particular interest in the most part unless you desire a detailed knowledge of issues of concern at this particular election. The speakers were principally J.B. Neales and J.P. Boucaut. Mr McCulloch spoke briefly to thank people for their support in the past and to indicate he would not be standing again as other candidates had come forward.]</p>
<p>J.B. Neales:</p>
<p>He felt that a deal of the trouble for the North was that electors failed to make him aware of what their needs were. He did his best, but they should tell him more.</p>
<p>He was concerned about middlemen making money from land sales.</p>
<p>Given that the Government had to raise money, he favoured the ad valorem duties.</p>
<p>He had been advised that there was no problem about started work on the Burra railway at the Burra end or at other points along the route.</p>
<p>Roads in the North were a disgrace, but he feared that even when they were built there would be problems maintaining them. He did not think tolls a good solution and was not sure that District Councils would be the answer either.</p>
<p>He did not advocate denominational teaching in Government schools, but he would not utterly banish Bible reading.</p>
<p>Mr Boucaut:</p>
<p>He agreed with much of what Mr Neales had said.</p>
<p>Immigration had been overdone, but it should not be altogether stopped, but better tailored to needs.</p>
<p>As Mr Neales had said the present land purchase system was rotten.</p>
<p>Certain areas should be set aside from which free selection of agricultural land could be made. It was not fair to turn squatters out after they had made significant improvements. Nevertheless, in appropriate areas the squatter must eventually give way to the more productive agriculturalist.</p>
<p>Customs House duties were a necessity (i.e. ad valorem duties).</p>
<p>The insolvency laws were a problem. A poor man with unpayable debts ended up in gaol while the richer person went though bankruptcy and set up business again.</p>
<p>He did not believe in denominational instruction in Government schools – that should be done at home.</p>
<p>[Both candidates went on at much greater length and also answered questions from the floor.]</p>

<p>The Wesleyan Sunday-school Anniversary was held last Sunday and Monday. On Sunday Rev. Wylie preached two sermons and addressed children, teachers and parents in the afternoon. On Easter Monday the children and teachers marched to Limestone Hill for their usual tea and cakes and they had plenty of grapes and played games. At 4.30 p.m. the public tea meeting was held, after which proceedings adjourned to the chapel. The collections amounted to c. £39.</p>

<p>In reply to a correspondent in another colony, I can say that the Wesleyans were the first and only church at or near the Burra in 1847. Their first place of worship was opened by the late Rev. D.J. Draper in October 1847.</p>

<p>Richard Barker of Bremer Mine, Callington, writes on 21 April.</p>
<p>I draw attention to the demonstration of a boring machine at Tincroft Mines, Cambourne, Cornwall. The Doering’s boring machine was at work at the 184 fathom level. I suggest that this and other machinery could make mines in SA viable by saving costs. The new Graves’ Engine Shaft at the Burra Burra Mine being a case in point.</p>

<p>Metals</p>
<p>[A short article tells of falling prices for all metals except tin. In the case of copper the huge exports from Chile dominate the market and low prices have not acted as a brake on the quantity from that source. The only hope of a rising price seems to lie in reduced production following the closure of some British and Continental mines and a large emigration of miners from Cornwall.]</p>

<p>The Burra Railway</p>
<p>On 30 April the newly elected members for Burra Messrs Neales and Boucaut waited on the Commissioner of Public Works and presented two memorials to him. One urged the creation of much needed employment by the immediate commencement of the Forresters-Redruth Railway, with work at the Burra end.</p>
<p>The other was signed by tradespeople of Kooringa and the neighbourhood and vouched for the validity of the plight of the 54 unemployed (and 23 soon to be unemployed) who had signed the first memorial.</p>
<p>The members spoke in support of the memorialists. The Commissioner said no time would be lost in completing arrangements to carry out the promise he had previously made in favour of commencing the line at both ends. He hoped everything would be ready to let contracts at the beginning of June, but a more formal answer would be forwarded next Monday.</p>

<p>‘One of the Number’ writes on 30 April in support of the Early Closing Movement.</p>
<p>Shop assistants are often working 16 hours a day. I would appeal to the wives of the working classes to try to crush this system and to try to assist some of their fellow citizens to obtain shorter working hours.</p>

<p>[Central Road Board, 21 April] Stationmen.</p>
<p>[There is an article reporting on a discussion at the Central Road Board concerning the possibility of discontinuing the position of stationmen along the main roads. They were men employed to look out for maintenance problems along the road and to see to immediate repairs. The alternative seems to have been to employ a fewer number of overseers who would have had much longer stretches of road to supervise, but who would have engaged local labour to attend to maintenance and not have done any of the work themselves. The stationmen also engaged labour, but also did some of the work themselves. The overseers would have received about twice the salary of the stationmen.]</p>
<p>7 May 1868, page 3</p>
<p>H. Nicholas of Spring Hill Farm, Salt Creek, writes re stationmen on 30 April.</p>
<p>[His letter reveals that the suggestion had been to replace 109 stationmen with 44 overseers.]</p>
<p>Stationmen look after 8-10 miles of road and many do fine work. If some do not do their duty the solution is to replace them – not to change the whole system. The suggested savings would be illusionary. Overseers would merely be gentlemen riding along the roads and never touching a shovel.</p>

<p>Booborowie residents are complaining that the new mail route excludes them from regular service. Their mail service is now inferior to places 400 miles from the city – delivery now depends on the doubtful chance of persons coming from Kooringa.</p>

<p>Burra News, 6 May</p>
<p>Accident/Obituary. A 16-month-old child of Mr Richard Reed, sheep farmer of Wandillah, was sent out to play with the rest in the morning. An hour later the child was found sitting in a small galvanised iron washing pan with its head hanging over the side, dead, but warm. The pan contained about three inches of soapy water. It is conjectured that the infant fell into the pan face down and struggled into a sitting position while nearly suffocated, and through its head falling over the side of the pan was unable to breathe freely and so died.</p>
<p>[Emma Reed born 6 February 1867 at Wandillah: died 2 May 1868 at Wandillah.]</p>

<p>A new bridge over the River Light on the north side of the railway near Kapunda was tested on Monday by Mr Mais the Engineer-in-Chief. The old timber bridge had become unsafe due to white ants and dry rot. The new bridge is of the same span – 100 feet between abutments. The new bridge is of wrought iron, designed by Mr Dempsey of Westminster and made by the London Engineers Co. [Further details are printed.]</p>

<p>Copper is Recovering</p>
<p>Reports from Swansea say orders for copper are finally rising and the economy in general is recovering and wool sales have been lively. In 1867 the Cornish smelters had closed and markets dwindled. America had a prohibitive tariff and France and Germany had cheaper labour. Imports of copper and regulus at Swansea for 1867 were 103,000 tons compared with 129,000 tons in 1866 and 222,000 tons in 1865.</p>
<p>Imports of pure copper rose by 173,000 cwt to 593,000 cwt as a result of Chile having learnt how to smelt cheaply following the discovery there of local coal. The Continental markets now prefer raw material to the detriment of Swansea’s operations.</p>
<p>Since February copper prices have firmed. The price of Chilean copper was c. £71 and Burra was quoted nominally at £81.</p>
<p>In March Chilean bars were quoted at c. £72-10-0 while Wallaroo was £80-10-0 and Burra £83.</p>
<p>Prices throughout March changed only slightly, but trade is picking up generally and prospects are more promising than at any time since 1866.</p>

<p>Ministerial Visit to Pt Wakefield. [Editorial]</p>
<p>When the Burra Company ceased to use Pt Wakefield the port was little used. There were abandoned houses and grass grew on the wharfs. The population departed. Mr Bright has devoted himself to the development of the poor.</p>
<p>He succeeded in getting money for a tramway to Hoyle’s Plains (£69,000) and also got £7,000 for clearing a channel in the bay. These works are near completion and a ministerial visit was arranged. A party of twelve left Pt Adelaide in the Goolwa last Thursday, reaching the channel off Pt Wakefield by midnight. The party started off in a couple of boats at 7 a.m. and travelled up the new channel. It was to comprise a cutting 41⁄2 feet deep and 3,300 feet long and 100 feet wide, of which 3,000 feet has been completed. The channel connects with a short channel made by the Burra Co. 17 years ago.</p>
<p>The old channel is only 50 feet wide and only half the depth of the new. The contractor suggests he deepen the old channel instead of completing the 300 feet at the sea end of the new channel and this idea is likely to be adopted.</p>
<p>The object was never to det ships to the port, but to allow barges access so produce could be taken out to ships – previously even barges were useless at neap tides and were often laid up for days together. Now the locals have 41⁄2 feet at ebb tide and 6 to 7 feet at high tide. This will suffice for barges at all seasons. Silting has not been a problem for the old channel and seems not to be bothering the new. It has however, drained the creek and deepening of the old channel will surely aggravate that. This will, in part, be compensated for by the new Government wharf of 250 ft, erected at a cost of £1,655.</p>
<p>The party then landed to inspect the town.</p>
<p>[A description of the town and its wheat handling operations follows.]</p>
<p>The principal buildings are the hotel – near the proposed terminus of the railway – and Mr Ferguson’s Mill. The abandoned stores of the Burra Co. have been re-opened. A new hotel is not yet open.</p>
<p>[The tramway is then described at length.]</p>
<p>The line runs generally east through Bowman’s Flat to Hoyle’s Plains and towards the Skillogolee. At various points it intersects the old road of the Burra Co., still used by the traffic between Auburn and Pt Wakefield. It crosses the river once at Dunn’s, via a cheap iron bridge. It reaches the Two-Mile House also known as the Wallaroo Inn, where the Wallaroo coach changes horses and then goes 14 miles to Dunn’s. At Dunn’s is a bush public house – it was originally the Copper Co.’s station for their bullock drays. Here the company’s bridge over the Wakefield is more than twenty years old and rather shaky. Here the tramway will cross on a light iron bridge. The visit of the party stopped at the end of Walker’s contract 22 miles from Pt Wakefield.</p>

<p>M. MacDermott writes from Kooringa 1 June:</p>
<p>Last Friday Captain Gregor, a mining agent, found some fossil bones in a small creek about half a mile from the Burra Cemetery. He recovered part of a lower jaw with four double teeth. The teeth measure 21⁄2 inches across the top surface in either direction. From the insertion of the teeth to the bottom of the jaw was five inches. A smaller piece of jaw without teeth and some other bones were also recovered. I saw the bones at Captain Gregor’s cottage and went to the discovery site. They came from a clay bed six feet under the bank. It is highly desirable that the bones be brought to the attention of the Adelaide Museum and a skilled person be sent to extract further specimens.</p>
<p>[The Register’s Burra correspondent also reports Captain Gregor’s discovery, giving similar details.]</p>
<p>3 June 1868, page 2</p>
<p>Burra News, 1 June</p>
<p>On Friday Captain Gregor, formerly one of the surface captains of the Burra Mine, found the remains of extinct animals in clay in the bed of Spring Creek. The jaw of an enormous animal held four teeth measuring 21⁄2 inches square on the upper surface. They were embedded in bone for five inches and protruded from it two inches. The piece of jawbone is about one foot long with indentations for several more teeth. Other pieces of bone were also found. The site was about halfway up the range of hills in the side of a channel some six feet deep, near its bottom and close to the rock bed. No one in Burra has the scientific knowledge to identify the animal.</p>
<p>Accident. Last week Mrs Dolman and her baby in arms were going home to Charlestown from Hampton when she missed her track and fell into an open well on the property of Mr John Snell. She fell thirty feet perpendicularly and reached the bottom virtually unhurt. The baby awoke at its usual time apparently also unharmed. A young foal came to the well in the morning, perhaps attracted by her cries and the foal’s neighing attracted a young boy who was riding by on a mare. Assistance was immediately obtained and both victims were extracted from the well. No bones were broken. Mrs Dolman was severely shaken and has been confined to bed ever since. [The child would appear to have been Mary Jane Dolman born at Charlestown 20 June 1866 to John &amp; Elizabeth Dolman nee Hoskin(g).]</p>

<p>Report on the Board of Education. [Editorial]</p>
<p>In the last twelve months 28 licensed teachers resigned their connection with the Board and with but one or two exceptions it seems it was due to being unable to make a living. Even in places where the population is large enough the fees are often so small as to be inadequate to sustain the teacher and his family. Many parents are too poor to pay fees and too proud to classify their children as destitute. Others have money, but prefer to put their children to work. Attendance is also often very irregular. In areas of scattered settlement the position is even worse. Some attempts have been made to have a school teacher teach alternately at two sites – but with very doubtful success. The number of destitute children rose by 174 in the past year and for this year is expected to rise further. One bright spot was an increase in the attendance of children aged 11 or over. Attendance at night schools also rose. Last July 625 attended at night. A training school for teachers is required. Many schools operate in very poor buildings – badly ventilated and overcrowded.</p>

<p>W.H. Challoner writes from Burra Burra Mines 5 June.</p>
<p>Today I examined the bones and agree with the very exact description given by Mr MacDermott. My impression is that they are the remains of a gigantic member of the Phascolomy family.</p>
<p>(Editor: Mr Waterhouse, Curator of the Institute Museum is now at Kooringa to examine the bones.)</p>
<p>11 June 1868, page 3</p>
<p>The Fossils at Kooringa</p>
<p>F.G. Waterhouse, Curator of the SA Institute Museum, 10 June.</p>
<p>On examining the bones in Captain Gregor’s cottage near the Burra Cemetery I immediately recognised them as the remains of the gigantic extinct animal Diprotodon australis of which many fossil specimens have already been found in SA and are well preserved at the museum. The bones examined consist of a much-decayed lower jaw (left ramus) with four true molar teeth, having roots displayed by the decay of the jaw bone, a portion of upper jaw containing some molar teeth and a small portion of the zygomatic arch. Also two lower incisors detached from the bone. These are straight and about 7 inches long and were originally deeply embedded in the jaw. And two upper incisors also detached, which are much curved. Among other bone fragments were portions of a scapula or shoulder blade.</p>
<p>Captain Gregor accompanied me to the discovery site. The jawbone is the most persistent part of the skeleton and it was in such a decayed state that I deemed it unnecessary to incur the expense of further excavation in the hope of finding more, especially as the animal is well known. Others had already made a good search around the spot.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell in his expedition into the interior found a large number of fossil mammalian remains. Among then was a large tooth identified by Professor Owen in 1838 as that of a gigantic marsupial allied to the kangaroo, but having remarkable affinities to the large non-marsupial pachyderms. Subsequently there were discoveries of other parts of the skeleton and eventually of an entire skull. This was almost three feet long. The hind legs were much shortened and the forelegs longer and strengthened compared with a kangaroo. The discoveries have been made in the most recent geological formations in Queensland and NSW and in several places in SA and so at one time this animal must have been widely distributed over the continent.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr John Hallett has died.</p>
<p>He came to SA on the Africaine towards the end of 1836. He purchased a town acre in Adelaide in the first land sale held there on 27 March 1837 and contributed towards the erection of the first Wesleyan Chapel and in March 1838 was a member of six gentlemen to consider measures relative to the Aborigines. He soon entered into business with the late Captain Duff and at the close of that business became a pastoralist. At his death he held Murninnie Station 60 or 70 miles north of Burra and the Wandilta [Wandillah?] Station not far from Burra. He was a shareholder in several mining companies, including the Adelaide Land and Gold Co., the Worthing and the Murninnie. He had a substantial brick house erected on South Terrace, which has since been demolished. On 9 March 1857 he was elected in conjunction with Mr T. Reynolds to represent the District of Sturt in the first House of Assembly under the new Constitution Act. On 23 March 1860 he was re-elected in connection with Mr Joseph Peacock. In 1862 he was again a candidate, but was defeated and he also failed in an attempt to enter the Legislative Council in 1863. Eight years ago he took up residence at Ilfracombe near Beaumont. In July 1866 he was taken ill with apoplectic symptoms and never fully recovered. He transferred control of his business to his brother, Alfred. Of late he has suffered from softening of the brain and has had three attacks of serious apoplexy. Bronchitis set in about a fortnight ago. He died [at Ilfracombe] on 10 June and was buried in the Magill Cemetery. He has left a widow and ten children; five sons and five daughters. Of the daughters, one is married to Mr Carlile of Mickolo, Western Plains; one to Dr Goldsmith of Robe and another to Mr Woods of the SA Bank at Robe. [Born in Essex, UK 30 August 1804.]</p>

<p>The Northern Mail on Thursday arrived in Kooringa five hours late and was only brought at all with great difficulty due to extraordinary rainfall. On the way the coach capsized and the passengers, including the Post Master General, were thrown out. The mails were then forwarded on horseback. The passengers proceeded in an open cart until it too had an accident and its shafts were broken.</p>

<p>John Kennedy writes to complain of the charges made for station stores in the outback. The men are compelled to take what is offered and to pay the price. There is no option. All sorts of obstacle are placed in the way of hawkers to prevent them from selling. There is no check on dishonesty. Light weights can be used. The Government ought to interfere.</p>

<p>Last Sunday the Bishop of Adelaide confirmed about 30 young persons at the Church of England. A large congregation assembled. His Lordship preached two sermons on the same day.</p>
<p>On Monday evening Rev. L.W. Stanton presented one of his usual entertainments. On this occasion a chief attraction was a lecture by the Lord Bishop on The early colonisation of the United States of America. Rev. Stanton gave three amusing readings and others presented songs and music. Proceeds went towards the repair of the parsonage at Redruth.</p>
<p>The new enginehouse [at Graves’ Shaft] is progressing favourably and will probably be completed in about seven or eight weeks. The shaft is now down to more than 40 fathoms and has a little water, but not enough to retard operations significantly.</p>

<p>Samuel Bailes is believed to have pillaged a number of huts on his flight from the Clare District to the North-Eastern Plains. On 8 July he was charged with stealing from the hut of James Rosser, a shepherd on Paratoo Run, one canteen valued at 4/-. On 2 July Patrick O’Neill Police-trooper and Trooper Catchlove arrested Bailes at Annattra on several charges of horse stealing and hut robbing. Rosser’s name was on the canteen with the prisoner and it was recognised by Rossiter along with a chain and strap. Bailes was committed for trial in Adelaide and was taken by the troopers to Clare, where other charges were to be preferred against him.</p>
<p>William Walsh alias Walter beadle was brought up on remand, charged with altering a cheque at Kooringa on 30 June, drawn by R. &amp;. P. Couch, from £4-14-3 to £64-14-3.</p>
<p>Mr S. Drew of Samuel Drew &amp; Co. said the prisoner had purchased c. £5 worth of drapery goods on 30 May and tendered the cheque in question as payment. As the amount was large and the man unknown only about £16 in cash and goods was given for it, with the balance to be paid on Monday morning, when the prisoner promised to call for it. He did not.</p>
<p>The bank returned the cheque unpaid and he notified the police. Corporal Shaw found the prisoner on the other side of the Murray, en route to Victoria, still in possession of the goods bought from Mr Drew, who identified them.</p>
<p>Richard Couch said he has paid the cheque to a man named James Linch on 18 May for lamb minding – it was drawn for £4-14-3. James Williams gave evidence that he saw Linch and the defendant in the Pig &amp; Whistle and saw Linch give the prisoner a cheque and saw the prisoner write something on it. He also heard the prisoner say he would go with the cheque to Drew’s and later saw him coming from Drew’s with a bundle. The prisoner was committed for trial in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Country Breweries</p>
<p>[There is a lengthy article on Country Breweries: Fotheringham’s at Gawler, Allen’s Creek, Burra, Oakbank, Auburn, Clare, Strathalbyn, Penola and the Auburn Aerated-Water Factory.]</p>
<p>The Burra Brewery is managed by W.H. Williams and is celebrated for its very superior XX and XXX ales. It has every appliance for the successful working of a brewery without the aid of steam power. An excellent malt mill has recently been brought from England. The machinery is driven by horsepower. The tuns, coolers, boilers and other stationary apparatus are on a large scale and can turn out more than the Burra market in its present depressed state can consume. The cellar is well adapted for storage, being hewn from limestone rock. In it are twelve troughs, each capable of supporting five hogsheads. Near the brewery is a galvanised iron store to house the malt and malt mill. Adjacent is a stone house occupied by the cellarman and a four stalled stable, cart sheds and other outbuildings. A convenient distance away is Mr William’s residence and neat garden. The prospect of the railway and the re-opening of the mine encourage Mr Williams to continue in business. As much as 48 hogsheads have been brewed weekly. Four horses are at present employed on the works.</p>

<p>A District Council has been formed here and it is hoped roads will now improve.</p>
<p>The Central Board’s attention should be drawn to the main road opposite the hotel, which is impassable. Teams formerly made a road through Mr R. Glasson’s section, but this has now been fenced off and the only route is therefore through private property. No one cares to repair it and as a consequence drays get bogged, resulting in much cruelty to animals and a great deal of profanity.</p>
<p>It has been very cold. Yesterday morning pools of water had half an inch of ice on them and wash tubs three quarters of an inch.</p>

<p>The Width of Tires Act</p>
<p>A meeting was held at the Aberdeen Hotel on 25 July to consider the provisions of the Act and the best way of relieving teamsters of the restrictions thus placed on their calling.</p>
<p>James Tiver, road contractor and builder, was voted into the chair. He described the Act as ‘class legislation’.</p>
<p>William Woollacott objected to the haste with which the legislation had been put through. He said it was one thing for the areas around Adelaide with metalled roads, but it was only very recently that any roads in this district had been metalled and the Act should not be enforced [on unmade roads]. Teamsters could not make a living with reduced loads and increasing the width of tires meant more friction and more bullocks to move a load, which also meant they couldn’t make a living. Bush roads should be excluded from the Act. Wide wheels cost £4 to £5 more to make. He said the Patent Copper Co. loaded its mule wagons heavily and had them follow one another in a continuous line. Each mule was shod and each team was about twelve mules. This was what destroyed roads far more than a team of unshod or half shod bullocks. He called for all owners of vehicles to be taxed as an alternative – why should owners of buggies get off scot-free. The Act interfered with free trade. He then proposed a motion calling for a petition for the repeal of the Width of Tires Act.</p>
<p>Mr M. Quinn spoke in support of Mr Woollacott and so did Mr W. Sampson, who blamed carters near Adelaide for cutting up roads and inflicting the Act on everyone else.</p>

<p>On 29 July the McCulloch Bros. of Black Rock ordered a man named Alexander Alexander to take four valuable horses and a wagon loaded with skins to Kooringa. He was to take the team a short distance to Princess Royal, belonging to Mr McCulloch and allow them to rest for a few days before returning to the station with a load. He disobeyed almost all those orders. He put the horses into the Burra Hotel stables for three days, during which he was quite intoxicated. He then obtained the loading from Messrs Drew &amp; Co. Among the load was a case of rum and another of bottled ale. When he failed to return on schedule a search was made and he was discovered half way back to Black Rock in a state of intoxication, having consumed all the rum and all but 17 bottles of ale. He had also lost the horses. They were discovered with the harness partly on and the knees of one broken, seven miles from home. On the return journey to the station he drank the remaining 17 bottles of ale. A barrel of tar and other articles to the value of £7 were missing from the load. When brought before Mr MacDermott SM last Monday at Burra, he was sentenced to two months’ hard labour at Redruth Gaol.</p>

<p>Obituary. An unknown man has met a horrible death in one of the abandoned shafts of the Bon Accord Mine. Last Monday Mr Dunstan, landlord of the White Hart Inn, sent his son to look for some horses. About 350 yards north of the inn he saw some swallows fly from a deserted shaft sunk 42 feet some years ago by the mining company. Looking down in search of nests the boy saw a man’s hat and then could make out braces and a man’s back. The police were informed. Police-trooper Dix followed a well-sinker named Jonathan Sleeman down to the bottom where they found the body of a man in an advanced state of decomposition, lying on his face.</p>
<p>His legs were doubled under him and the thigh bone of the right leg protruded through the trousers. When taken to the surface it was seen to be the body of a man of c. 35 years with long black hair and beard, about 5 feet six or 5 feet seven inches tall. [Details of his dress and clasp knife follow.]</p>
<p>At the inquest no one could identify the man, though Mrs Davey of Redruth Post Office had sold a pair of braces and some trousers to a man of the same description in the early part of the previous month. The shaft is thoroughly unprotected and though not in a place of general traffic is not far from a short cut taken by bushmen coming from Mt Bryan. The place ought to be immediately secured. Even in daylight a man on horseback could easily miss it in short grass and ride right into it. The verdict was death through accidentally falling down the shaft.</p>
<p>A small collection was made and given to Mr Sleeman who first ventured down the shaft, as it was a courageous feat; the sides being composed of overhanging rocks, some of half a ton weight and loosened by rain.</p>
<p>It is surprising that both Sleeman and the Police-trooper regained the top in safety.</p>
<p>[See 17 November 1868, page 2 for identification.]</p>

<p>Changes in Working the Burra Mine</p>
<p>Mr Darlington, a mining engineer of considerable standing, arrived here by the July mail to advise the Burra Directors on the future working of the Mine. He has since spent most of his time at the Mine. Last Thursday Hon. H. Ayers and G.S. Kingston with Messrs Jaffrey and Beck visited the Mine and we understand Mr Darlington has recommended a system of trenching rather than mining.</p>
<p>Extensive excavations will be made to the creek side of the Mine. Nearly the whole of the orey country comprising the present workings, all the drives, slides, levels and shafts will go and all the ore left as supports along with large deposits of rich stuff used in filling up. Even all the timber will be recovered and if suitable for no other purpose will become fuel for the engines. This will no doubt shock many traditional miners, but will be far less evil that the total or partial suspension of work at a mine that was once the saviour of the colony. We hope these plans will accomplish what their proponents anticipate. The scheme is not yet fully developed and decided on, but if adopted, the workings being developed presently in the usual manner will be stopped. Regular tutwork and tribute men would not be required and ordinary labourers could do the work, leaving miners for other advanced mines in the colony.</p>
<p>It is not clear how they would manage the dressing operations with ordinary labour, but it is certain that much done by hand will be done by machinery. The invention comes from Germany and if successful is sure to be applied to other mines in the colony.</p>
<p>Mr Darlington’s report will be laid before the Directors at the meeting next month. It is believed Mr Darlington will proceed to England by the next mail to procure the requisite machinery and the new system could be under way within twelve months.</p>

<p>The Burra Death</p>

<p>Michael McCormick, a well-known carrier on the Burra Road was charged with stealing three horse collars, five bridles and one harness, saddle and breeching from the SA Mining Association.</p>
<p>Thomas Bentley, the managing stableman at Burra Mine, said he had missed the articles and all were branded SAMA. After obtaining a search warrant he and a trooper overtook the prisoner two miles from Burra on the North Road. They found one of the bridles on the first horse and then Bentley and Trooper Dechert found the other missing items in the drays or on the horses.</p>
<p>Police-trooper Frederick Julius Dechert stationed at Kooringa gave corroborating evidence and Henry Dawson gave evidence as to the value of the items, which he said totalled £4-17-6. The prisoner was committed for trial in the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The Burra Railway</p>
<p>Rapid progress is being made with the Burra Railway works. Deep soil is found on the plains through which it passes and persons in search of farms can see it in the cuttings. Contractors on the line are ready to employ as many miners as choose to apply. At present very few Burra men are employed on the railway.</p>
<p>The Burra Mine</p>
<p>The talk here has been of nothing except the complete cessation of all work at the Mine. A notice was posted last Friday that all work would cease on Thursday 24 September. People feared that after the news in last week’s Register all work would cease, but few anticipated all creek dressing would stop so soon. Such, though, is the case. At the end of this week there will not be a single tributer at work and in two months it is thought not a single person will be raising or dressing ore by the present method. Reports also say that at the end of that time the engine will be halted and the water be allowed to rise to its natural level. The miners fear that when that happens the timbers will slip from their places and all the ground above will sink down to form a vast quagmire, being dangerous to work on and very difficult to remove. Future mining in that ground would be all but impossible. No doubt all this has been considered.</p>
<p>The effect of this complete stoppage will be disastrous for the working and business classes. Already men are leaving daily for Wallaroo and once they have found homes their families will follow. When the new works commence a complete change of population will have taken place. About 300 men and boys are now employed.</p>

<p>Last week the country was beginning to be very dry and fears were held that there would be no more rain this season and crops would fail. Sheep farmers were also afraid of another season of drought. On Sunday morning soft gentle rain fell and then in the afternoon there was a thunderstorm. The Burra Creek rose quickly and washed Mrs Foy and family out of their home in Swansea Vale. It also threatened to enter the White Hart Hotel and the Aberdeen Hotel, but the Mine authorities breached the banks of sand across the creek and averted this flooding.</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. A shepherd named John Wardmann died suddenly on World’s End Run last Monday. Mr Warland the manager said the shepherd had been unwell for about a month. He was worse on Monday and Mr Warland went to seek Dr Dashwood’s services, but Wardmann died before the doctor arrived. A verdict of death from natural causes was retuned at the inquest held at the Miners’ Arms, Kooringa, the next day, before Mr MacDermott SM. Disease of the heart was the immediate cause, accelerated by exposure to cold and penurious living. It is believed the deceased had saved a considerable sum of money and was about to return to his native Switzerland to retire. [Died 28 September 1868 World’s End Run aged 53.]</p>
<p>17 October 1868, page 2</p>
<p>Kooringa townspeople are agitating for freehold title to property in the township. A letter signed by leading townspeople has been sent to the Directors, making a series of points.</p>
<p>The Mine had completely stopped work.</p>
<p>Trade had therefore slumped.</p>
<p>The likely siting of the railway terminus would preclude Kooringa from any resulting benefit.</p>
<p>Many of the company’s leases in the town had expired or were on the verge of expiring.</p>
<p>Most of the shops and houses were now or soon would be the property of the company.</p>
<p>The representatives of firms who signed wished to know under these circumstances if the Directors would sell freehold to them and if so at what price. The result of letting land on 21-year leases with a host of stringent clauses, including one that no public house could be opened without the Directors’ consent, was to create a town that is a laughing stock to strangers. No one will spend more on buildings than is absolutely necessary. Residents will not form a District Council or a Corporation, which would repair roads etc. because they will not tax themselves to increase the value of the company’s property, in which they have but a temporary interest. It is hoped the Directors will agree to sell freeholds at a reasonable price to those who have been at the expense of erecting buildings upon them.</p>
<p>19 October 1868, page 2</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>The Directors have issued their half-yearly report to shareholders.</p>
<p>In the past six months over 2,000 tons of ore have been obtained, an increase of 200 tons on the previous six months. This is from open surface working and dressing the orey-slime in the creek and is estimated to contain 17% copper. Also at the end of March last there was c. 834 tons on hand for a total of 2,836 tons.</p>
<p>2012 tons of this has been delivered to the English &amp; Australian Copper Co., leaving 824 tons at the Mine. Copper dealt with in the past six months has been 333 tons, of which 183 tons was the balance on 31 March and nearly 150 tons received from the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. Close to 212 tons of copper were sold in the colony, leaving of hand c. 121 tons.</p>
<p>The balance sheet deals with transactions for two years; 30 September 1866 to 30 September 1868. Among the credits is a sum of £88,299 paid for wages, plant, stores, etc. and another of £6,963 as expenses of establishments, officers’ salaries etc. and another of £34,535 for Karkulto Mine, buildings, workings etc.</p>
<p>Graves’ Enginehouse has been erected and the shaft sunk to 50 fathoms and a level has been extended to the south, which can be united with Roach’s 50 fathom level by a few more feet of driving.</p>
<p>A prominent place in the report is given to Mr Darlington’s Report. In accordance with this the present method of raising and dressing ore is to be discontinued. Cupreous ground and lode stuff from the surface to the 30 fathom level or deeper if practicable is to be open-worked before any further progress is made on the lowest level operations. The object is to utilise all the pillars and blocks between galleries and stopes, which are believed to contain thousands of tons of ore that is accessible without the heavy costs involved in deep sinking. The new workings will employ machinery that will dispose of hundreds of tons of lode stuff daily and will concentrate ores intermixed with clay and stone and size the ore so as to render valuable stuff hitherto worthless.</p>
<p>At the same time a dressing floor to deal with the orey sand in the creek will be constructed. The expense to carry out these recommendations is estimated at £25,000, an amount which can be raised from unrealised produce now on hand. Mr Darlington has been instructed to obtain from England all the necessary machinery and appliances and it is anticipated that in 18 to 20 months the new process will be ready to start. By that time it is probable the railway will have reached Burra and it is hoped the copper market will have improved. Mr Darlington is of the view that the Directors were correct in putting a stop to workings there.</p>

<p>At the inquest conducted by W.H. Challoner JP at the Miners’ Arms, Dr William Henry Dashwood said that at the post mortem he had found the heart in a state of hypertrophy and the liver was fatty and enlarged. The cause of death was an ‘effusion into the pericardium, consequent upon an old standing heart affection’ and probably accelerated by recent inflammation.</p>

<p>Central Road Board, 20 October</p>
<p>Plans for a new£3,000 wrought iron girder bridge at Williston were approved and sent at once to the Commissioner of Public Works.</p>
<p>A letter from D. Meehan drew attention to the dangerous state of the bridge spanning the Burra Creek at Redruth. It came through the Commissioner of Public Works who added a note requesting the Board to have the repairs, costing £10, executed. Mr Macaulay added a memo agreeing that the cost would be c. £10, but added that a new floor for the bridge would soon be needed at a cost of £120. The bridge however, was not under the control of the Central Board because it was not on a main road. The work was ordered to be done with the Government finding the funds.</p>

<p>Burra Branch of the Bible Society</p>
<p>The annual meeting was held at the Bible Christian Chapel on Friday 23 October. The report said there had been no meeting in 1867 because the deputation had returned to Adelaide on the arrival of the Duke of Edinburgh, before reaching Burra. The two years covered by the report had not been nearly as successful as the year before when the subscriptions amounted to £211 and £200 had been sent to the parent auxiliary. The income for the two years had been £179-0-1, including £4-18-5 carried forward from 1865. Of this £132-1-3 had been collected and £42-0-5 came from sales by the depository. This was dispersed: £60 was a free donation to the Adelaide Auxiliary; £33-10-0 was paid out for books and after working expenses £68-11-5 was in hand. Returns for the present year were incomplete and the committee recommended a payment of £100 [to the Adelaide Auxiliary]. Reference was made to the stoppage of the Burra Mine having affected the funds.</p>
<p>27 October 1868, page 3</p>
<p>Wool Washing</p>
<p>Wool sent from Australia to England in former years often fetched a low price due to the amount of dirt within the wool. Both the cost of land carriage and the freight to England for this dirt was considerable. One small run calculated that last year £180 was paid to transport the dirt! The dirt can be removed by soaking the sheep in hot water and then directing a strong jet of cold water on the sheep while it is in a bath. The Messrs Cowper of Baldina near Burra have erected a simple yet serviceable apparatus operated under the supervision of Mr B. Dowling. The cost, when taking into account the increased value of the wool, is trifling.</p>
<p>The washing place is in Baldina Creek in which water flows continuously.</p>
<p>Water is taken in a race over sloping ground until it has a height of six feet – the race is c. 110 feet long. Near the end are two spouts a few feet apart so two sheep can be washed at once. They are made of zinc four feet deep, three feet wide and twelve inches across at the top, tapering to a jet of one eighth of an inch. Externally they look like a wedge. The stream emerging is nearly the length of a sheep. Underneath the spouts are tanks about five feet deep. The top of the tank is six feet from the race and two feet from the bottom of the spout. Adjoining the spout tanks is another tank ten feet long by five feet wide, with three divisions where for every 100 gallons of water there is mixed two pounds of soap and four pounds of soda. This will wash one hundred sheep. The tank holds 1,200 gallons and is supplied from two large boilers holding 800 gallons situated within a few feet. The water in the soaking tank is kept at a temperature of 110°F by means of the boiler. The sheep are taken from a yard six at a time and plunged into the first division of the soaking tank. This is deep enough to immerse them and they are kept swimming for three minutes, till thoroughly saturated. In the second division the water is shallow enough for them to gain a partial footing and here they spend a further three minutes. In the third division they get a firm footing for another three minutes before running up an inclined plane to the stage adjoining the spouts. They are then thrown into the spouting tank. Here two men seize the head and legs and keep each animal floating under the spouts. 100 to 150 gallons a minute descends on it. As the water falls it takes away incredible quantities of grit and dirt. The men turn the sheep around until it turns white – a process taking from one to two minutes. By this time the animal is exhausted and barely able to bear the weight of the water in the fleece – estimated at about 60 pounds. The sheep are then left to dry for two or three days on grassy land.</p>
<p>The cost is from 1d to 2d per sheep.</p>
<p>The quantity of dirt washed from sheep from the Murray Flats, which are very dirty, is from 50 to 60% of the weight. A bale of unwashed wool weighs about 448 pounds, while a bale of cleansed wool weighs about 200 pounds. The saving in carriage and freight is obvious. In addition the clean wool fetched a higher price. Last year two pounds of greasy wool fetched 16d, but cleaned and reduced to one pound it sold for 21d, a clear gain of 5d and 2d on cartage easily covered the cost of cleaning. Losses by death in the process are trifling – less than 0.5%.</p>

<p>Accident. On Friday a man named Peartree was travelling on the roof of the omnibus from Kapunda to Kooringa and when it struck a hole he was jerked off. The wheel passed over his leg inflicting a severe wound. He is progressing under the care of Dr Dashwood. He had only been married a few days.</p>

<p>The Roseworthy-Forresters Railway</p>
<p>A deputation met with the Commissioner of Public Works on Tuesday 10 November to protest the proposal to move the station from Wasleys to Forresters. Wasleys was served by superior roads and served a larger population. The Commissioner thought he would be able to comply with the request. The proposed change had arisen over the water supply. Mr H.C. Mais, the Engineer-in-Chief, said it was probable the station would be at its original site at Wasleys and the water supply would be at a distance of about a mile at Forresters.</p>

<p>The crops are looking splendid with no signs of red rust. Were farmers to get hold of the land in the neighbourhood of Burra, it would soon be one large agricultural area; even as it is fully 4,000 acres have been sown or fallowed since last year.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales’ birthday on 9 November was honoured with races at Mt Bryan, about 12 miles from here. From 9 a.m. till dusk the road between the two places was busy with horsemen and vehicles coming and going. The scene at the ground was very lively and the races were well contested. There was a trotting match between McDonald’s ‘Parr’ and Dawson’s ‘Maggie’, which was keenly followed as they were thought to be evenly matched, but ‘Parr’ broke so often that he had no chance. After the races the principals adjourned for luncheon provided by Mr Dawson at the Mt Bryan Hotel. [Results are printed.]</p>

<p>Obituary. It will be recalled that not long ago the unidentified body of a man was found at the bottom of an abandoned Bon Accord Mine Shaft. Mr Burns of North Adelaide has now identified the pocket-knife found with the deceased as being his son’s. Mr Burns had a son in the neighbourhood and has heard nothing of him. A person named Burns was at Burra Hotel just before shearing time and sent his swag on ahead with mates, saying he would follow in the evening. He has not been seen since – though his mates seem to have made no effort to discover his whereabouts. [See reports 11 September 1868, page 2 &amp; 18 September 1868, page 2.]</p>

<p>Kooringa Primitive Methodists held a bazaar on 9, 10 &amp; 11 November. On Monday the school children from Kooringa, Redruth and Copperhouse walked in procession through the town headed by the circuit minister Rev. J.T. Pithouse and Mr G. Hannens, Superintendent of the Kooringa Sabbath-school. Being a holiday the bazaar was well patronised and upwards of £80 was realised.</p>

<p>Bushfires have broken out in several places, but have done little damage so far. Most people suspect incendiaries. A fire was seen on Monday evening on Mr Thomas Warnes’ Run. Jeffrey Pearce and a Spaniard called Barilla went on horseback and worked with spirit until it was extinguished. About 11⁄2 acres was burnt.</p>
<p>Three employees of the Mt Bryan Run have each been fined £1 plus £1 costs for assaulting a man named Carson on 9 November in the station kitchen. Ill feeling and drink seem to be the origin of the affray.</p>
<p>The weather has been very hot.</p>
<p>Hay making is progressing rapidly – though the yield is less than last year. The wheat crop looks very well.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 10 November the Trustees of the Wesleyan Chapel presented a beautifully engraved piece of plate to Mr A.H. Forder in recognition of his services in association with the choir. A tea meeting was held and several members of the choir were highly complimented on their achievements over the past six years.</p>

<p>The Burra Railway Terminus</p>
<p>A government survey party visited the neighbourhood on Tuesday, apparently to define the position of the railway station. Speculation was naturally rife. First it was asserted that the half dozen allotments owned by the Government on which the Court House and Police station are situated was the chosen site. Then another Government owned allotment in Redruth halfway between the Mine and the Smelting Works was named. But all speculation was futile; the decision awaits the arrival of the Chief Engineer late this week.</p>
<p>Kooringa News, 9 December</p>
<p>Since the stoppage of the Mine the greater part of the mining population has migrated to other districts, many to Wallaroo, a few to the diggings and one or two to the silver mines.</p>
<p>The miners’ cottages present a most deserted appearance. Where once all was teeming with inhabitants is now a scene of desolation. The houses generally have windows smashed and doors unhinged with collections of rags and rubbish on their thresholds. The old mine is desolate. Not a man is to be seen. The engine hangs motionless. The exception is the main street where the shops remain open and are far from being deserted, as might have been expected. The rapid increase in farmers around, the families of absent miners, those working on the railway and bush customers have all allowed the tradespeople to hold their ground. On the whole they do not seem to fear the stoppage and the dullness of trade that must come before the resumption of operations.</p>

<p>State of the Crops</p>
<p>From W.F. Coglin, Kooringa 30 November</p>
<p>Kooringa District – About 2,000 acres more than last year were sown. There is no shrivelled wheat and only a trifling amount of red rust. Some small patches of smut. The average yield should be 15 bushels and up to 25 in places. There are only a few acres of barley and none of oats. About 10,000 acres are under fallow. The hay is all gathered in good order. Reaping will commence in ten days.</p>

<p>‘A Liberal Contributor to the Fund’ writes a letter:</p>
<p>Can anyone inform me what has been done with the sum of about £400 collected eight years ago by bazaar and other means for building a church [Anglican] at Redruth? Nothing has, I believe, been expended on the building in the last nine years.</p>

<p>Settlers on the Murray have been annoyed for some time through Aborigines being continually supplied with intoxicating drink. Serious disturbances have occurred and often men on stations have had to stay home, neglecting their work, to protect their families and property ‘from violence by the intoxicated barbarians’.</p>
<p>Evidence was hard to bet and native testimony would not be given much weight. Police-trooper [name illegible] collected evidence against 13 men by posing as a bird fancier and winning the confidence of the natives. Five of the men who were shearers discovered the trooper’s identity and fled the district before they could be served summonses, but eight cases wear heard:</p>
<p>James Simmonds, wine storekeeper of North West Bend and Maria Simmonds his wife received five convictions and a fine of £6 for each plus costs £1-15-0 each to a total of £38-15-0.</p>
<p>Thomas Taylor, innkeeper at North West Bend received two convictions with fines of £3 and costs of £1-15-0 for each case. [£9-10-0]</p>
<p>H. von Reiben of Mallyon’s Hotel, River Murray received on conviction and a fine of £3 plus £1-15-0 costs.</p>
<p>A poor widow named Banin whose husband died last March of consumption at Kadina was last week dying of the same disease surrounded by five little children aged from 8 years to 14 months. An amateur concert was got up for her benefit. [The program is printed.] £7-10-0 was collected. Unfortunately the poor woman died just before the concert started and the money was used to aid the orphans, who will ultimately be sent to the Destitute Asylum.</p>

<p>John Meredith writes re the Redruth Church</p>
<p>An enquiry recently about the money raised several years ago for the Redruth Church now makes me ‘express my regret for not having sooner publicly testified my disapproval of the misappropriation of that money’.</p>
<p>As a contributor I say that if changed circumstances make it undesirable to continue with the project, I should, if a public meeting were called, vote for it to be invested as an endowment for the church in the district. As I am leaving the colony I shall instruct my attorney to give his support to any plan to which other subscribers may agree upon to recover the money.</p>

<p>‘Beta – a subscriber of £25 altogether’ writes re the Redruth Church</p>
<p>In the accounts of the Norwood Church I have seen a certain amount borrowed from the Trustees of the Redruth Church. I have heard that the interest has been given to the minister at Kooringa instead of allowing it to increase the funds. As a subscriber I do not approve of that. The Redruth Church will soon be wanted when the terminus of the railway is fixed. The walls have been built three or four feet from the ground and if not there now the greater shame, for it is within sight of the parsonage. The foundations are concrete on a hard rock base and cost over £100. I will add to my donation when I see a prospect of its being carried out and I shall agree to nothing else being done with trust money. I care not for giving my name publicly, but you can give it to any proper enquirer.</p>

<p>Rev. Lionel W. Stanton writes on the subject of the Redruth Church Funds.</p>
<p>[This refers to a considerable sum of money collected earlier for the purpose of erecting an Anglican church at Redruth.]</p>
<p>He says that the previous Thursday a letter had been published in which it was alleged that the interest from this fund had been paid to the minister instead of it being allowed to accumulate. Mr Stanton, as minister at Kooringa for the past four and a half years, says as far as he is aware he has not received so much as a farthing of either its capital or its interest. When asked about the fund he has always replied that he knew nothing at all about the fund and it did not seem to him to be his duty to meddle in the matter. Now it seems it is necessary to clarify it as he is being accused of somehow being a ‘sharer in the spoil and particeps criminis.’</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<p>‘I am informed by residents here that the Rev. Mr Ibbetson, of St John’s, Adelaide, and formerly “minister” here, is Treasurer and sole Trustee of this fund; if so I suppose he will at once give (as doubtless he can) a very satisfactory account of it, if only in justice to himself and his former co-Trustees. Besides, as it is just possible a church may yet be required at Redruth, as “Beta” suggests, and it may become necessary to solicit further subscriptions, it is not unlikely that the absence of authentic information as to the whereabouts and whatabouts of this money may prejudice and injure the cause, which I presume Mr Ibbetson would be among the foremost in deprecating and lamenting.’</p>

<p>The Burra Railway (From our correspondent)</p>
<p>The railways works here are in a forward state and are well ahead of contract time. The next contract to the south is not so well advanced. Four places are spoken of for the location of the actual terminus.</p>
<p>Paxton Square.</p>
<p>The Court-House allotments in Redruth.</p>
<p>An allotment close to the Special Survey on the Smelting Works Hill.</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Mine.</p>
<p>Paxton Square has the advantage of being right in Kooringa and this would increase the value of property there; all owned by SA Mining Association. Unfortunately it would cost between £10,000 and £20,000 to bridge both the Burra Creek and Welsh Creek and to construct the necessary cuttings and embankments and it would not increase revenue at all. North and north-eastern settlers would have to travel parallel to the line for three-quarters of a mile and then cross the creek to reach the station. The two sites in Redruth share a good deal of the same disadvantages [though without having to cross Welsh Creek.] The Bon Accord site lies at the junction of the north and north-eastern roads and there are no buildings there and so no town allotments to acquire and it is the nearest possible spot for the Burra Mine to which it could easily be linked by an inexpensive tramway. There is an abundance of water and it is best located for the other towns like Copperhouse, Hampton and Nelson. Experiences at Gawler and Kapunda suggest that such a location would not have a bad effect on the business centre in Kooringa. The only disadvantage is that it would be three quarters of a mile from Kooringa.</p>
<p>12 January 1869, page 3</p>
<p>Board of Education</p>
<p>Reports were read on the results of examinations at a long list of schools. The Burra District schools referred to were:</p>
<p>Dennis Horan Farrell’s Flat</p>
<p>William West Redruth</p>
<p>15 January 1869, page 2</p>
<p>Redruth Post Office. On the evening of the 12 January an attempt was made to set fire to the Redruth Post Office. When Mr Davey, the postmaster, emptied the letter receiver at 10 o’clock he found a scorched pill-box full of ashes and a box of matches. Police are investigating.</p>

<p>The Bushman’s Home Movement. There is a move in Adelaide to establish a home for bushmen in Adelaide on lines similar to the Seaman’s Home. It would provide a place of accommodation and support for men arriving in the city with money to spend after long periods of isolation in the bush. It would aim to ‘check the encouragement which their weakness gives to thieves and prostitutes, and worse still, the keepers of low public-houses.’</p>

<p>Body Found at Burra. Two sons of Mrs Nichols Opie of the Smelters’ Home Hotel, Aberdeen, were searching for some rabbits when they looked into the closet of the vacant Mine Hospital. They found a bundle under the floor made up of blue blanket and gunnybag. Police Trooper Dix was informed and he discovered the badly decomposed remains of a new-born child. W.H. Challoner held an inquest at the Smelters’ Home on 3 February, but the jury found it was impossible to determine if it had been born dead or alive. It has not been possible to ascertain who might have placed the body there. It appeared to have been there two or three months.</p>
<p>[But see next item.]</p>
<p>12 February 1869, page 3</p>
<p>Redruth Court, 10 February</p>
<p>Elizabeth Neville, widow, was charged with unlawfully disposing of the body of a child of which she had recently been delivered by placing it in the closet of the Mine Hospital. Sarah Thomas and Sarah McEwen both gave evidence that the accused had told them she was guilty of concealing the birth of the child, but had the child been born alive she would not have concealed the fact. After the birth she had intended to bury it, but had not been able to go as far as the cemetery. Alice Woollacott (c. 11), daughter of William Woollacott gave evidence that at about Christmas she had been sent for to make tea for the prisoner who was then very ill. Evidence was also given that the prisoner had kept her box locked for some time until she had left with a bundle. Esther Strike, a married woman living with her father, Mr Woollacott, said the tea incident had been at the end of November. She had visited the prisoner later that day and found her ill and in bed. Dr William Henry Dashwood gave evidence that the prisoner had admitted to him that she had given birth, but said that when she had become conscious the child was dead. She had tried to take the body to the cemetery, but had fainted outside the Aberdeen Hotel and then fainted a second time near the Hospital and was unable to go further. Dr Dashwood said he had examined the body and had no suspicion of foul play, though the body was badly decayed and the bones disarticulated. The prisoner said that poverty had driven her to act as she had and she wanted it known that no one else was present at the birth and no one had assisted her in any way in the matter. The prisoner was committed for trial at the next Criminal Sessions.</p>

<p>Mule Teams. Some local businessmen in Kooringa are proposing to buy mules from the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. to establish a system of carriage by mule teams between Burra and the Barrier Ranges. Whether anything will come of the idea is as yet uncertain.</p>
<p>19 February 1869, page 2</p>
<p>A Mill at Burra would be a good investment according to our local correspondent. A mill to grind flour and cut chaff should be kept busy because Burra currently forwards large quantities of these products to the north and north-east and beyond the Barrier Ranges. Farmers in the area are continuing to break new ground to grow wheat and soon all land not locked up in sheep grazing will be growing grain.</p>
<p>27 February 1869, page 2</p>
<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Co. has accepted a tender for deepening the approach to their proposed wharf extension at Pt Adelaide. We understand they intend to increase the accommodation by 500 ft from the present frontage of 200 ft to the junction of the company’s property with St Vincent Street. The new wharf will comprise a double row of screw piles 8 ft apart, backed by a dwarf wall of slag and concrete and decked 27 ft wide with Swan River jarrah. Mr Blackman will supply the timber and Mr Anderson, an engineer, is on his way here to supervise the erection of the wharf. The wharf will have a uniform depth of 18ft at low water. The company intends to erect large warehouses on the wharf.</p>

<p>‘Hawker’ writes on the Bushman’s Home idea.</p>
<p>[He suggests that the paper has been refusing to print letters opposed to the scheme, while printing supporting correspondence. He takes the view that bushmen generally are opposed on the grounds that it singles them out as a class needing support and protection and is supported by squatters for purposes of their own. The Chairman and secretary, he says, are deeply unpopular among bushmen. The whole idea is patronising and demeaning. It would also provide unwarranted competition with the private enterprise of respectable shopkeepers and innkeepers. The editor denies any bias and says he is willing to publish arguments against the concept when they are temperately expressed. Other letters received have been very intemperate and dealt only in assertion and insinuation rather than reasoned argument.]</p>
<p>11 March 1869, page 2</p>
<p>‘A Friend to the Bushman’ writes in response to ‘Hawker’</p>
<p>[He argues that far from supporting the idea of a home, if the squatters were as against the interests of the bushmen as ‘Hawker’ suggests, they would be encouraging his continued squandering of his earnings, so making him more dependent on them. As for the alleged unpopularity of the chairman and secretary; even if this were true, they are no guaranteed to hold their position once the scheme was established and certainly one a series of homes was established, they would hardly be controlling them all. He then takes up the issue of the need of the homes and the accusation of the patronising nature of the movement. He admits that there are many who do not need either reform or assistance, but to say that there is no role for the idea is nonsense.</p>
<p>‘But it is too true that bushmen of the lower class are improvident, drunken and immoral. It is well known that after receiving their wages – sometimes a considerable sum – they will go to a public-house, and give the owner their money on the understanding that they are to drink it out and it is no less true that these unfortunate men are fleeced in the most shameless manner. No wonder that publicans and storekeepers oppose the movement; it would deprive them of their large ill-gotten gains.’</p>
<p>He continues to say that when established there was opposition to the Sailor’s Home, but no one now says that they are degraded by frequenting the home. He continues with other argument before concluding:</p>
<p>‘A “Home” is much more wanted in Adelaide than at the Burra, where not more than half a dozen bushmen would ever think of spending their holidays. It is chiefly to the capital that the bushman looks for what he calls his “spree,” and it is there that he requires care and protection more than anywhere.’</p>
<p>26 March 1869, page 2</p>
<p>Vandalism. For some time the owners of unoccupied buildings at Kooringa have been annoyed by having windows broken by unidentified youths. No sooner do occupiers leave than the windows are smashed. Mr John Viant of Paxton Square saw a boy throw stones at the windows of the adjoining cottage and, recognising them, reported them to Mr Challoner JP, the Mine Accountant. He prosecuted William Stephens aged 11 who was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment with hard labour at Redruth Gaol. Mr Challoner said damage worth thousands of pounds had been done to the company’s property at Kooringa. A reward of £5 had been offered, but had not been successful and police had also failed. Mr Viant was offered £5, but rejected it. The damage is not confined to vacant houses. On the 13th windows in the [Anglican] church, the Wesleyan Chapel and the Bible Christian Schoolroom were all broken – as many as eight panes in the one building.</p>

<p>Easter. The annual church festival was held on Easter Monday. Over 200 persons sat down to tea at the Grammar School, which was crowded with tables three times filled. The room was decorated with green boughs, artificial flowers and scriptural texts. Some youths displayed their agility on gymnastic apparatus and other games were played with enthusiasm. In the evening at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room Rev. Stanton put on an entertainment of music and singing by Mr Dashwood and lady members and readings by himself. The readings were a mixture of didactic, pathetic and humorous. Attendance was estimated at c. 400. £6-10-0 was raised for the Female Orphan Home.</p>
<p>Agriculture. Good rains have seen crops planted with vigour and the country is green. Large areas of new land have been ploughed.</p>
<p>Kooringa Businesses are surviving better than many had expected, given the stoppage of the Mine. Although business has been dull, it is not as dull as feared. It has been a surprise that so many remain in the town after the mine stoppage. The answer seems to lie in the role of Kooringa as the entrepot for the vast areas to the north and northeast. Kooringa is the source of supplies for this area, extending into NSW. Many of the miners’ cottages are occupied by the familles of bushmen, while the men are away either looking for work or in full employment. Others are occupied by the families of teamsters.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary drew about 400 on Easter Monday.</p>
<p>Burra Mine. In May the plans of the new machinery are expected and then a few hands may again be employed to prepare for working the mine according to the new plan. Should this be successful the mine will turn out as much ore as in former times and with the arrival of the railway to reduce the cost of transport the returns should again be handsome.</p>

<p>Notice. The SA Mining Association calls an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders for 12 May to authorise the Board or any future Board of Directors to sell all or any part of the Burra Special Survey No. 1 that has been laid out as the Township of Kooringa. [While retaining the mineral rights.]</p>

<p>The Burra Mine. We understand that on arrival in Europe Mr Darlington wasted no time in giving instructions for the manufacture of the dressing apparatus to be used under the intended arrangement for removing the ore by means of open workings. The whole of the ore on hand has been disposed of to the E &amp; A Copper Co. 100 tons of copper have been exported to England for sale since last September and about 204 tons remain on hand. The loss on the workings of the mine since September 1866 has been £10,833-19-6, including the cost of sinking Graves’ Shaft from the 20 fathom to 50 fathom level, the erection of the engine house and other outlay to the benefit of future workings. A sum of £61,000 has been transferred from stock account arising from previous profits to meet this loss and that on purchasing and working the Karkulto Mine, leaving a balance to the credit of the profit and loss account of £32,761-1-10. The debits include the subscribed capital of £12,320; balance of stock account, £49,280; forming together £61,600, the amount of the proposed capital for the future, besides £32,761-1-10as the credit of profit and loss, and £827-1-2 due to sundry creditors. The credits, estimated at £95,188-3-0 include the value of fixed property, machining plant, stores, unsold copper, sundry debtors and cash. Mr Darlington is believed to have secured the services of a competent agent, who is expected to arrive shortly to supervise the operations under the new system.</p>
<p>SA Mining Association. We believe that at the coming meeting of the company the Directors will propose the opening of an office in London where information can be obtained and a register of shares kept, with provision being made for the transfer of shares and payment of dividends. It will also be proposed that the declared value of the capital will be £61,000 divided into 12,320 shares of £5 each, five of which will be awarded to the holders of each of the existing 2,464 shares in exchange for and in lieu thereof. By a new deed of settlement power will be reserved to increase the capital to £100,000by the issue of new shares.</p>

<p>Burra Mine. The plans for the Mine failed to arrive by the last post. This disappointed many because the railway works near here are nearing completion and many of the labourers are hoping to transfer to work of some sort at the mine, without having to wait very long. In the meantime business in Kooringa is dull.</p>

<p>Redruth Court, 22 April</p>
<p>A young woman aged 15 or 16 was charged with stealing a horse and bridle, saddle, tether rope and headstall. She was Caroline Harrison. On Monday in Kooringa she had a bridle with blinkers and asked for the eyepieces to be cut off. The request was refused. Later that day she was seen at Mt Bryan Hotel still with the bridle. Mr Robson, a teamster allowed her to ride as far as Middle Camp where he stopped an hour or so before sunset and turned his bullocks out for the night. The next day Mr John Thomas of Aberdeen, who had left his saddle, bridle, tether rope and headstall on a dray about five miles from Burra, reported to the police that these items had been stolen and in their place he had found a bridle with blinkers with a stirrup iron and leather, which he suspected were off his saddle. A little later Messrs Hallett reported the theft of a brown mare from their Wandillah paddock about half way between Robson’s and Thomas’s dray. Police Trooper Smith went searching and found the accused in a hut at Canowie. Her explanation being unsatisfactory she was committed for trial at the next Criminal Sessions on both charges.</p>

<p>Dr Berncastle has been in Kooringa and his visit created much excitement. At Least £100 was paid by those seeking his particular expertise. So far only one of his patients seems to have benefited from his skills.</p>
<p>[The rest of the article makes reference to has activities elsewhere and it seems he was probably a charlatan. The descriptions do no indicate exactly what he did or claimed to do, but it seems to have been some sort of eye surgery or treatment.]</p>

<p>The Bushmen’s Home. ‘A Subscriber’ writes as a bushman suggesting that the intention to locate such an institution in Burra is a mistake and the city is a far more useful location. He goes on to ask why anyone would choose Burra if they had endured one to three years of living in remote areas and then wanted a bit of a spell. ‘Who would choose such a hole as the Bon Accord Mine or the Burra to enjoy themselves? I am sure I would not, and I am also sure that very few will.’</p>
<p>‘The generality of bushmen are a shade above the natives, some of them being well-educated and intelligent men, and know full well the enjoyments of a civilized life, and at intervals will have them, cost what it will.’</p>
<p>Sailor’s Homes have been a success precisely because they are in or close to the principal cities and so the inmates could go and enjoy themselves according to their different inclinations.</p>
<p>‘The idea of a Bushmen’s Home is a splendid proposition, and I should like to see it prove a success.’</p>

<p>Northern Extension Railway. By about noon today plate-laying should have reached Stockport. Engines should be able to cross Hamley Bridge about Monday next. It is hoped the Government will dispense with some red tape and allow the carriage of wheat, flour and other stores as soon as the station is ready.</p>

<p>Obituary. On Saturday news reached Kooringa that a man had been found dead standing upright in a dismal and secluded hut on Caroona Run about 40 miles from Burra. It is believed the deceased committed suicide through extreme loneliness and poverty while temporarily insane. He had been hired on 17 April as a lambminder and sent to the hut at Hog Back. In a few days it was noted that his flock was drifting and a search of the area failed to find him, but no one looked in his hut. Last week an old man whose sight was defective was given the care of the flock and when he entered the hut thought he saw the deceased standing alongside his bunk, his eyes wide open and quite dead. He informed Mr Austin who investigated and found the man hanging from one of the rafters with his hands at his side and his feet touching the ground. There was no sign of a struggle but the neck was dislocated and it is conjectured he jumped off the bunk and death was instantaneous. He was Thomas Müller, aged 37 and a German by birth. Nothing could be ascertained about him except he had apparently been a clerk and was living in extreme poverty. An inquest was deemed unnecessary, especially as a dozen men could not have been found within ten miles of the spot.</p>
<p>[SA Deaths CD says he was Thomas Muller aged 37 who died 25 April 1869 on Cachowla [sic] Run.]</p>

<p>Editorial on Engineering works in progress. Many of the public works authorised three years ago will be viewed with very different feelings from those of their originators.</p>
<p>One of the new lines has already been placed on trial and several others are nearly fit for inauguration. Mr Mais has taken pains to supply the public with information about the expenditure upon them. [A section of the article then deals with the Strathalbyn-Middleton Railway and another with the line from Pt Wakefield.]</p>
<p>The Roseworthy-Forresters Line, though a mile longer (241⁄2 miles) than the Port Wakefield line was intended to be, has been constructed in little more than half the time. By the end of 1868 it was operational from Roseworthy to the Light. This comprised 121⁄2 miles of main line and two miles of sidings. The piers and timber staging to cross the Light had been completed and the girders were delivered in December from the Cremlin Works of Kinnaird Brothers in Monmouthshire. The foundation stone of the bridge was laid in July 1868 by Mrs Hamley, whose name it bears. The last contract connected with it expired on the 1 March 1869. The line ought to be very nearly ready for a visit from His Excellency and the Commissioner of Public Works. The station buildings have been designed with an eye to economy. There will be two of Stephenson’s 10-ton outside-cylinder engines, two composite carriages for passengers and twenty goods trucks. Mr Mais reports the completion of the works will be for a sum slightly within estimates.</p>
<p>The Northern Extension Railway had been only twelve months in hand at the date of this report. The line has been divided into four sections: No. 1 from Forresters north for 71⁄2 miles, No. 2 the next 14 miles, No. 3 the next 14 miles and No. 4 the next 131⁄2 miles. This brings the line within 11⁄2 miles of Burra and the final section will be allocated once the site of the terminus has been determined. Tenders have been let for the earthworks, masonry, ballasting and fencing of these sections. At the end of the year the first section was ready for plate-laying, the second was within four months of the expiry of the contract time and the other two were advancing rapidly. The 25 iron bridges have been ordered from England and advice has been received of their shipment. They comprise twelve 20 ft spans, ten 30 ft spans and three 60 ft spans. The locomotives are expected in July and the wagon frames have been ordered. They will be fitted out at the railway carriage works. The rolling stock has been designed for lightness. Mr Mais has no great faith in the carrying capacity of 40 lb rail, which had to be adopted throughout. [The editorial then goes on to discuss other lines.]</p>
<p>Dr Berncastle. [Another item deals with this much publicised practitioner who claimed to be an eminent oculist and aurist. The paper says it is yet to find a single well verified case in which he effected a cure, but reports on some very bad outcomes. The Doctor had eventually fled back to Victoria.</p>

<p>Editorial: The Roseworthy-Forresters Railway</p>
<p>The present program aims to see the inauguration of the railway to Forresters in June, of the Port Wakefield line in September and of the Burra extension in November. The Commissioner of Public Works visited two of the lines last week and a Register reporter went along. On leaving the Adelaide Station we could see the new line parallel to the Northern line, but leading to Bowden Junction. This has just been completed. We dashed to Gawler at 40 m.p.h. Within and hour of leaving Adelaide we had reached Roseworthy where we crossed the downward train. Here were huge piles of sleepers waiting to be despatched to the Burra extension line and we entered upon the Roseworthy-Forresters branch. Several miles of this have been available for wheat traffic for some weeks. Impatient farmers and dealers are already complaining that the line’s resources are in adequate. At first the line runs through rich farming country before entering a stretch of scrubby country. Farmers here are battling to clear land. More might be turned to agriculture were it not for the restrictive price of £1 per acre. Embankments and cuttings are few. The sleepers are stout sawn gum, with over 2,100 allocated per mile. The ballast is limestone. The fencing of strands of wire with straining posts every 600 yards. The intermediate supports are too flimsy and in future iron T posts will be employed. Wasleys station is substantial and superior to others on the line for no apparent reason and its erection has cost some £600 to £700 beyond the limit. Beyond here the line skirts wheat fields. A quarter of a mile from the River Light the engine had to descend upon unballasted rails, a slope rendered by an extensive cutting, somewhat less formidable than it naturally appears. The train halted just a few yards before the impressive structure of the Hamley Bridge, just on the eve of completion. The valley here is 300 ft wide and the river is crossed at a height of 80 ft. The abutments are of firm white Kapunda sandstone. The central support is a cylindrical pier 6 ft in diameter and 70 ft high. [Rather more detail is then provided about the Hamley Bridge.] The foundation stone of the bridge was laid by Mrs Hamley ten months ago and the line across it will be inaugurated in a month.</p>
<p>After half an hour the inspection continued by buggy. Two or three miles beyond Stockport we came upon plate-layers completing the permanent way.</p>
<p>Forresters, the nominal terminus of the line, lies nearly a mile away from the actual terminus at Tarlee, where the forerunners of a town – an inn, a blacksmith’s shop and a Methodist Chapel – are already to be seen. A skeleton of a station has been erected. The plate-layers will be here within a few days and not many weeks will pass before they continue onto the Burra Extension. The Commissioner is hopeful of having the line laid to Burra in time for next season’s wheat traffic and for the reopening of the Burra Mine.</p>

After the meeting held on Wednesday to consider the project of erecting a flour mill, another was formed to consider the action of the SA Mining Association with respect to renewing leases.

<p>Obituary. At 20 minutes past 4 o’clock 22 June Mr J.M. Stacey on entering Adelaide Railway Station saw someone lying apparently in a fit. On being raised the person was recognised as W.K. Elphick, late of Kooringa. Dr Phillips was sent for, but Mr Elphick died before he arrived. The deceased apparently walked from his home to buy a ticket for Freeling and while in the action of securing his ticket he fell down in a fit. He had not been unwell and had not been subject to fits. He was a colonist of many years and had once carried on business as a chemist in Rundle Street and then was for a long time assayer to the SA Mining Association. His services had been dispensed with upon the stoppage of the Mine. He had been living in Gilles Street. He was a most respected citizen and a man of unblemished character. An inquest will be held.</p>

<p>Booborowie District. Many people have visited the area lately seeking land and if a quarter get it not only Canowie, but Yongala as well must succumb to tillage. A visitor of two years ago would not believe what has been done in so short a time. Wheat has been successfully grown a few miles from Canowie. On Monday there was some heavy rain and some people reported hail the size of marbles.</p>
<p>12 July 1869, page 3</p>
<p>Fencing Sheep Runs. A letter from ‘Bucolicus’ printed in the Sydney Mail recently is reprinted.</p>
<p>[The writer approves of fencing cattle runs because cattle are apt to work their way back to where they were bred and this is prevented. They also quieten down and fatten better. He does not think the same can be said of sheep runs, based on his experience and reports from the Riverina. The squatters expect that with fencing they will save the shepherds’ wages and keep, while the increase in sheep numbers due to lambing and the income from meat and wool will remain as before. They fail to add in the cost of removing dogs. Then there is the capital cost of the fencing and the ongoing cost of servicing a loan. Water supplies may also have to be provided in the paddock. The writer alleges that lambing rates are lower and the wool of inferior quality. They will also find it necessary to employ more men at mustering times for cutting, weaning and shearing. Such men will not be readily available. Towns also tend to dwindle as the population in the area declines. Sheep in paddocks are timid and raced off when disturbed, thus fattening less well.]</p>

<p>Redruth Court, 14 July</p>
<p>Ann Macarthy alias McCaul and Bridget March were charged with using profane, indecent and insulting language on 3 July.</p>
<p>John O’Leary, tanner, said he was passing Macarthy’s house and March was at the door, very drunk. Macarthy used very insulting words and when he remonstrated she was very abusive. He informed the police and threatened to inform the Destitute Board from whom she received rations.</p>
<p>Richard Stephens, a butcher, said both defendants came to his shop and made a row. A black man came for some meat and when he refused to shout Macarthy some she became abusive. She then also abused another customer named Pounce, eventually attacking him with a meat cleaver and threatening him with a butcher’s knife. Witness distracted her and Pounce escaped. Macarthy went away, but later returned and wanted a pluck, [i.e. heart, liver and lungs] becoming abusive when told there was none available. She then tried to attack him, but he forced her from the shop. She followed him when he left the premises, later threatening to kill him as well as again being abusive. Defendant March, who was drunk called the witness some names and wanted to fight him. For the whole afternoon no one could come to the shop without being insulted and the shop could not be kept open. Robert Morley, police trooper gave corroborating evidence and further evidence of appalling language in the evening when a crowd gathered around the Macarthy’s house. He also gave evidence that on at least one occasion the defendants had sold the Destitute Board’s rations and bought drink with the proceeds. Macarthy was sentenced to one month and March to 14 days in Redruth Gaol.</p>

<p>‘Traveller’ writes calling for urgent action on the Saddleworth-Black Springs Road. He is also scathing about the Black Springs-Chinkford [Chingford - later Manoora] Road. He says at the very least the four or five bogs crossed between Glendore [Black Springs] and Manoora demand attention. A bridge across the Wakefield and another in Chinkford are also needed.</p>
<p>24 August 1869, page 2</p>
<p>A ‘Correspondent in the North’ writes with the idea of canalising the River Broughton as a means of transport to the coast from the Booborowie area. There are, he says, a dozen springs in the Booborowie area and a good source of water at Gum Creek and more from the Hutt River, which would supply the water for a waterway, but urgent action in needed before all the land along the route is alienated in the present rush to bring agriculture to the area.</p>

<p>Mr William Dare at Piltimitiappa had at the last lambing a lamb with three ears, eight legs, two loins and two tails. It was born alive, but starved to death when the ewe would have nothing to do with it. Mr Dare extracted the entrails and pickled it in brine for a month and then sent it to George Bennett of the Aberdeen Hotel. He in turn got Mr William West of Redruth to stuff it and surprisingly the result is an interesting curiosity and not unpleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>31 August 1869, page 3</p>
<p>Booborowie people are reported as satisfied with the new postal arrangements from Daveyston [Hanson], though Kooringa is complaining of the loss of business. The Hundred of Ayers, with the arrival of small farmers, expects to produce 40,000 bushels of wheat next season, even at the low rate of 10 bushels per acre. The northern portion of the Hundred of Hanson will probably produce much more. The Hundred of Andrews is partly under crop and by the end of the second year of the mail contract 100,000 bushels could be looked for.</p>
<p>Agriculture. The area around Kooringa seems to be heading into drought. Showers within the next fortnight would not come too late, but time is running out.</p>
<p>Rev. L.W. Stanton gave an entertainment in the Burra Hotel Assembly Room on Monday. The room was well filled. [The musical items are listed.] Mr Stanton gave clever readings of the following pieces:</p>

<p>The Attorney General intends to ban the hawking of colonial wine. This move will be much approved of by squatters. It is well known that many shepherds, while isolated in the bush and unable to get intoxicating beverages make useful and careful men, but when hawkers place alcohol within reach (they often sell colonial brandy under the pretence it is wine) the result is a loss of control and sometimes with very serious consequences.</p>
<p>Primitive Methodists held their Anniversary services at Kooringa on Sunday and Monday. Rev. J. Standrin preached to large congregations on Sunday. The public tea was held on Monday. £29 was raised.</p>

<p>A correspondent to the paper urges Chinkford [Chingford-Manoora] as a proper terminus for the railway. He sees it as an excellent central place from which the areas of Black Springs, Apoinga, Emu Flats, Auburn, and Mintaro could be served.</p>

<p>Burra Mine. Mr Darlington, who recently inspected the Mine, returned to England and it is reported has engaged Mr Swansborough to superintend the new workings of the Mine. The necessary new machinery is presently being manufactured under Mr Darlington’s direction. Mr Challoner will retain general superintendence, but Mr Swansborough will superintend the new system of working. It is not known yet when Mr Swansborough will arrive in the colony, but the Directors expect to recommence working by April 1870.</p>

<p>Agriculture. It is reported that crops around Kooringa are seriously affected by the drought and unless rain falls within two weeks it is feared they will be past recovery.</p>
<p>The Burra Extension Railway. The whole of the bottom ballasting of the Burra line has now been laid and when the bridges are finished the permanent way will be completed to the terminus. Morris &amp; Bond have the contract for laying the line. The rails have reached Riverton already. If the sleepers can be supplied in time the line could be open to traffic in December of January.</p>
<p>17 September 1869, page 2</p>
<p>Pastoral Outlooks in the North-Eastern areas are grim. There is scarcely a bite of grass now, with summer still to come. North of Kooringa the outlook is only slightly better. Last year at this time a boiling down works at Wildoto operated for three or four months, but now the sheep are carrying too little fat to make this a viable option. Butchers at Kooringa are selling hind quarters of mutton at 1/6 and sides at 2/6, but supply far exceeds demand.</p>
<p>Burra Mine. The work of preparing for the new system and installing machinery is expected to start in five or six weeks on the arrival of Mr Swansborough.</p>
<p>Agriculture. There has been no appreciable rain since June around Kooringa. The grass is short and already yellowing. Wheat crops so far remain green, but are very short. If rain does not fall within two weeks many farmers will not recover seed wheat. The days have been warm and dry, sometimes with unseasonably hot winds.</p>
<p>21 September 1869, page 2</p>
<p>Weather. Rain fell from Kapunda to Kooringa on 20 September. It started about 5 a.m. Saturday morning and continued with a few intervals for 24 hours or so. The outlook for the wheat crop has changed abruptly. The mail driver reports that the falls must have continued for many miles north of Burra.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr S. Drew of the firm of S. Drew &amp; Co. of Kooringa has died at the early age of 42. He arrived in SA on the Lalla Rookh in 1840 when aged about 13. He came here in charge of an uncle, Mr Edward Drew who died at Glen Osmond a few years ago. He was first employed in Adelaide by Mr W. Paxton. A few years later he moved to Kooringa, where he was employed by Mr John James, a Burra storekeeper. Over 20 years ago he began in partnership with Mr Young under the style S. Drew &amp; Co. and the company had been very fortunate. His partner left for England in the Duke of Sutherland six months ago and is expected to return by the St Vincent. The business is being managed by a younger brother of Mr Drew. The deceased had been in failing health for the past year and some time ago moved to North Adelaide. He is survived by a widow and nine children and had several brothers and other relatives. [Samuel Drew born 28 August 1827 Somerset: died 23 September 1869 North Adelaide.]</p>

<p>The Crown Lands Ranger will cease to have a job after the end of the year as a result of recent action in the Legislature. This will be good news for the wood carters, many of whom did not bother to get a licence before a local ranger was appointed. They would risk a fine as so rarely did a ranger visit the area. The fees and fines pay for the Ranger many times over. With no local ranger less money will be collected in the dog tax and grazing on Crown Lands will be carried on with impunity. The police cannot take over this work. It requires the sort of local knowledge that can only be acquired in 12 months or so and police rarely remain longer in one place. This action will result in loss of revenue and local graziers will be greatly annoyed through travelling sheep trespassing on their properties.</p>
<p>Burra Mine. 42 men are engaged this week. It is apparent the Directors intend the new method of dressing will be carried on with vigour.</p>

<p>Burra Mine. Workings have been resumed on a small scale from the beginning of November. This is but a prelude to the more enlarged and important operations to be carried out under the supervision of Mr Swansborough. Some of the new machinery arrived on the Orient and the rest is expected shortly.</p>

<p>SA Education. School Returns for 1869.</p>
<p>[This article does not mention Burra specifically, but it gives an overview of the state of SA Education and outlines some of the reasons that contributed to the changes made in the 1870s. The writer gives census data to conclude that SA should have between 30,000 and 35,000 children at school. The actual total shown in the returns is 20,846. Thus less than two thirds of those of educable age are enrolled. Actual attendance is yet lower; only 17,866. And of this figure 1,626 are under the age of five and 523 are over the age of 15 and so outside the measured number of educable age. This means barely 15,000 of those of educable age are actually attending school. What of the quality of education? One can assume that good organisation of schools and a staff of decently paid teachers would be necessary. There are 527 schools and 1,013 teachers provided for 17,866 scholars, giving an average of 34 scholars per school and 17 per teacher. If each child pays £3 per annum, including the Government grant, the average income per school would be £102 and per teacher £51. Good scholars cannot be maintained on such a footing. The figure of £51 is only half the earnings of mechanical labour. The writer concludes after further discussion that perhaps 10,000 receive a fair elementary education, but no more than 500 to 600 get anything like a higher education.]</p>
<p>‘The 527 schools, with their 1,013 teachers – has not produced anything very creditable to us as a nation. It has neither attained a high standard of instruction nor has it secured a large school attendance.’</p>

<p>‘A Bushman’ writes at some length on the appalling conditions of the working classes in the bush. He discusses the filth and squalor of the accommodation, the lack of utensils, clean water, sanitary arrangements and decent food. The flour is full of weevils, the sugar contaminated by sugar mite and the tea more twig than leaf. Payment is poor and when in the form of cheques not readily negotiable.</p>
<p>‘Equine’ writes calling for riders of bicycles to be regulated. In the city they are dangerous. They cause horses to rear and sometimes fall to the danger of both animal and rider. They imperil others’ lives. In the country little danger might ensue from their antics, but in the city it is time the authorities took an interest in their ‘dangerous gyrations’.</p>
<p>The Farrell’s Flat Railway Station seems to be right for Clare folk. We are pleased the mail is to be run from there. A well-known miller is said to be contemplating erecting a mill and there is also talk of running cabs to Clare etc. A resident landed proprietor is on the eve of cutting up one or two sections for a township.</p>

<p>Saddleworth is prospering with the coming of the railway. On 15 December a branch of the National Bank was opened and Mr Oldham transfers from Kooringa to manage it. Siekmann &amp; Moule are erecting a spacious corn store near the railway station. Gurr &amp; Cornish are building a substantial structure with domestic accommodation on the upper floor and their store on the lower. Their store is intended to be used in the wheat trade. Mr Kevill is the third wheat buyer in the town. It is hoped the railway will soon be open for goods traffic with the passengers to follow not long after.</p>

<p>‘A Bushman of Ten Years’ writes endorsing the statements of ‘A Bushman’ of 13 December.

<p>Ulooloo Gold-field. Gold has been discovered at Ulooloo Hill about 25 miles northeast of Burra near Messrs Stephens and Brayley’s Run. Mr Harvey, an experienced digger from Kapunda, recently took up land in the neighbourhood and he and Mr Brayley undertook to seek for gold in the creek. Two dwt of gold came from three tubs of ‘stuff’.</p>

<p>Redruth Court last week. Mr Whitting a sheep farmer from the Barrier sued former Police Trooper Molloy for £50 damages for false imprisonment. Whitting had one evening put his hand on the shoulder of a young woman, whom he claimed he had mistaken for one who was going up to his station with him. The young woman did not answer his, being deaf, but apparently felt he was going to insult her and called on Molloy for help. Molloy arrested Whitting, handcuffed him, forcing handcuffs on a recently dislocated wrist that was much swollen. He refused bail and forced Whitting to spend the night in the cell with a single blanket. The next morning Whitting was convicted of drunkenness, resisting police and assaulting the young woman. The jury gave damages of £25.</p>

<p>Weather. Monday at Kooringa could justly be described as ‘Black Monday’. A violent wind drove clouds of dust, which shrouded the whole town all day in dust. Nearly all the shops had to close to save their contents. The storm reached its height in the afternoon. Little damage was done.</p>
<p>Agriculture. Crops around Kooringa have turned out badly. In a few exceptional cases a fair quantity of hay was cut.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr James Reed died suddenly near Mt Bryan on 8 January. Mr Porter JP held an inquest at the White Hart Hotel, Redruth [Aberdeen]. Dr Dashwood said the deceased had died from a severe attack of cholera. The funeral was largely attended. The deceased was an old resident of Burra. [Aged 27.

<p>As yet no payable deposits have been found, but prospectors are sure the prospects are encouraging. All prospectors have found some gold, albeit not enough to make a living. Mr Jordan with experience from Victoria intends to make a further trial.</p>
<p>Accident. On Sunday morning Mr Lipsett of Kooringa was driving from chapel to his residence in Redruth and was about to cross the Mine Bridge when his horse swerved and bounded into the creek, dragging with it the cart and driver. They fell some eight feet and the cart and horse became wedged in a gutter, unable to move. Mr Lipsett was thrown over the horse, landing in front of it. Assistance soon saw the horse and cart extricated and the driver suffered only trifling injuries. The place is dangerous and needs to be fenced.</p>
<p>Inquest/Obituary. Mr Porter JP held an inquest into the death of James Reed at the White Hart Hotel on Sunday. Mr Reed lately settled at Mt Bryan and was the son of J.S. Reed, the proprietor of the White Hart Hotel. On Friday the deceased had complained of vomiting and stomach cramps, but went to work. He died at 3 a.m. Saturday at his home some eleven miles from Dr Dashwood’s. The Doctor was sent for, but Mr Reed was dead by the time the message reached him. James Kelly gave evidence of the progress of the illness. Patrick Kelly said he had been living with the deceased for three years six months and when the deceased has complained of being purged in the morning he had thought it was due to the previous night’s meal of sucking pig. Reed had been winnowing smutty wheat. He had not wanted the doctor sent for; asking only for some medicine. Marie Dunneman, a young woman staying with Mrs Reed corroborated the details of the illness. Dr Dashwood said the message received had not suggested any urgency, so he had made up some medicine and then taken the mail cart to see another patient at Waterloo. He judged that death was due to Asiatic cholera. A few hours after death the body was quite black and swollen and emitted such an effluvium that approach was difficult. The verdict was death from natural causes.</p>

<p>Ulooloo Gold-field</p>
<p>A report in the Northern Argus says 7 oz of gold have been brought into Burra from Ulooloo, but no one here seems to know of it. Last week a party of four brought down from 3 to 5 dwt from trial dishes. Several holes have been sunk, the deepest to 20 ft and they have bottomed on quartz boulders, which are too hard to handle by the miners. Everyone seems certain good weighty gold is there, but no reef has yet been disclosed. About a dozen persons are camped there.</p>
<p>Burra Railway Station. The residents are unanimous that the terminus is a shabby affair, quite unworthy the intended use. There is no accommodation at all for passengers and but little for officials. Perhaps this is to make up for the palatial structure at Wasleys.</p>

<p>Ulooloo Gold-field: from a correspondent of the Northern Argus.</p>
<p>The field is creating great excitement, but has not had much of a trial. Many of the diggers are quite inexperienced and easily disheartened. At present about 50 men are present and no doubt the field will give employment to hundreds during the winter. Water is available in a perennial stream. As far as I have ascertained no one has yet been very successful and the greatest quantity I have seen was only 2 dwt by two men in five days.</p>

<p>Church of England. A bazaar was held recently at the Grammar Schoolroom to aid the Parsonage Repair and Church Endowment Fund. Singing and music added to the enjoyment and over two days the attendance was numerous in fine weather. [Stall holders are listed.] Total receipts were over £200. This is a great sum considering the depopulated and dreary state of the town.</p>

<p>A Bolt. On Monday morning Dr Dashwood was driving a two-wheeled buggy between Redruth and Kooringa when the horse shied at some children sitting on the bank near the Telegraph Station. It bolted up the hill, capsizing the buggy and throwing the Doctor out. The vehicle was then righted and the horse turned down the hill and made it to the road again, in the process capsizing the buggy and throwing out the other occupant, a small boy. The horse then parted from the vehicle and continued through the creek and up the Smelting Work’s Hill dragging part of the wreckage. Eventually it ran into Welsh Creek and ran along it towards the Mine Store where it was eventually caught. Neither passenger was much hurt.</p>
<p>12 February 1870, page 3</p>
<p>A Bolt. On Saturday Mr Porter was returning to his residence at Koonoona, Springbank in a buggy when he stopped to talk to some men doing some fencing for him. The horse bolted, but Mr Porter had the presence of mind to jump out and escaped unhurt. The buggy had its fore-axle and shafts broken, but the horse was captured with trifling injuries.</p>
<p>Accident. On Saturday the Catholic Priest had a fall when mounting his horse near the chapel in Kooringa and, though not badly hurt, had to be taken home to Clare in a cart.</p>

<p>Northern Extension Railway. People at Mintaro are disappointed that the line was not opened on Monday as promised. We are informed that it will shortly be opened for down, but not for up traffic.</p>

<p>Northern Extension Railway. The line was opened on Monday for traffic from Tarlee to Manoora. A few people assemble for the occasion, but there was no influx of visitors from Adelaide and only a few passengers going up. Riverton will benefit from the mail now arriving by train to then be sent on to Clare via Rhynie, Undalya and Auburn.</p>

<p>Fire. The Redruth Post Office and store was totally destroyed by fire at about 4 a.m. on 27 February. It was occupied by Mr Martin Davey. Mrs Davey and two girls were sleeping in a bedroom adjoining the shop and were awakened by the flames. They ran outside and alerted neighbours, but assistance was useless. The flames were spread rapidly by the high east wind. No stock and not much else worth mentioning was saved. The stock was insured and the building is also believed insured by another office. All letters for delivery and those posted for transmission were destroyed along with post office sundries.</p>
<p>2 March 1870, page 4</p>
<p>Northern Mail Arrangements. On Tuesday for the first time mail for Clare was sent to Riverton by train instead of to Kapunda and thence by coach. The return mail leaves Clare at 5.30 a.m. and the contractors are Hall &amp; Partridge. Arrangements are deemed unsatisfactory for passengers as they will be unable to get to town by the midday train, unless they get to Kapunda by the Burra coach. Many say the mails would be better taken to Hamilton by coach from Kapunda and thence to Clare by Cobb’s bus. Cobb &amp; Co. will run a coach from Clare at 10.30 to meet the train at Saddleworth. This will all change when the line is opened to Redruth when it is expected there will be two trains a day on the northern line as well as on the Kapunda line.</p>
<p>4 March 1870, page 3</p>
<p>Inquest on Redruth Post Office Fire. Mr MacDermott SM conducted the inquest at the Redruth Court House on 2 March with Mr A. Stewart as foreman of the jury. Mrs Davey, wife of Mr Martin Davey said she discovered the fire on Sunday 27 February at about 4 a.m. In the house at the time these were beside the witness a servant girl Ellen Cushion, a young girl named Mary Jane Foy and a young boy named Samuel Cask. The two girls and Mrs Davey slept in a bedroom next to the shop and the boy in a sitting room at the back of the store. Martin Davey was very ill at Wallaroo; too ill to be informed of the disaster. They had all gone to bed shortly before midnight. They went to bed by candlelight, having placed the store lamps on the sitting room table and put them out. No one in the house smoked. The alarm was raised by Mary Foy who was disturbed by a sound she thought was thunder. Ellen Cushion said no, it was fire. The fire was then burning the door between the shop and the bedroom and the hangings of the bed were soon alight. Very rapidly the fire spread to the deal ceiling aided by a strong east wind. Ellen Cushion dragged Mrs Davey’s box out of the room as the witness ran to awaken the boy. She then tried to save a harmonium but had to abandon it when it got stuck in matting in the doorway. All the letters in the post office were lost, but a few unclaimed ones were saved from the back of the building. Mr T.F. Scott managed to save then, the day book and ledger.</p>
<p>[Mrs Davey then gave evidence about the insurance cover and the stock that had been lost.]</p>
<p>Ellen Cushion gave corroborative evidence. She had seen no one about outside when she had run out. Other witnesses were examined at great length, but nothing further was elicited. The stock had been insured for £500 and the building for £300. The verdict was ‘That there is no evidence to show how the fire occurred.’ They added a rider ‘That the building where the Post-Office was kept was not suitable for the purpose on account of its inflammable nature.’</p>

<p>Booborowie Mine. Captain Collins has passed through Burra en route to re-open the Booborowie Mine. The proprietors are fortunate in obtaining their claim, as the North Burra Co. made a mistake as to their boundary and has sunk several shafts and raised some good ore on the Booborowie section under the impression it belonged to them.</p>

<p>Northern Extension Railway. At present the line is open as far as Manoora or Chinkford [Chingford] as the residents insist upon calling it. The 80 miles to this point are covered in 51⁄4 hours, representing an average speed of over 15 m.p.h. and for the line beyond Roseworthy it is 11 to 12 m.p.h. The problem is the long delays at stations; in most cases at least 15 minutes. People will certainly demand a better result when the line is fully open to Redruth.</p>
<p>11 April 1870, page 5</p>
<p>The Burra Mine</p>
<p>Visitors to Kooringa are still tempted to turn aside and visit the old Burra Burra Mines. ‘Their wealth and good services to the community must ever be held in grateful remembrance.’</p>
<p>‘No mineral discovery in the future can ever produce do profound an effect as did the finding and development of the Burra Burra.’</p>
<p>Three or four years have worked a marvellous change in the aspect of affairs at the mines. No great time has elapsed since they were appropriately described as a hive of human industry. Clusters of workmen were engaged in the important duty of digging out the green ore. Below ground were hundred of miners, one set succeeding the other in perpetual relay. On the surface nearly as many were employed in the processes of raising, dressing and smelting. The activity was reflected in the trade of the adjoining townships of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen and half a score of smaller villages, all sharing the prosperity of the SA Mining Association. The stoppage of the Burra workings was an ill day for them. Businesses lost the bulk of their custom. The streets lost much of their traffic. ‘An appearance of antiquity and the reality of decay settled down upon the whole place.’</p>
<p>The next census returns, if not too long delayed, will place Kooringa in the rank of non-progressive towns.</p>
<p>The electoral rolls show a material decline in the number of qualified voters. But there are still grounds for predicting a brighter future for Kooringa. The inhabitants can see that something is being done on a gigantic scale, but they are puzzled by the mysterious preparations now in hand. At the bottom of the creek in immediate proximity to some of the former excavations, a huge platform 60 feet high has been erected upon pillars formed of the old iron tubing taken from abandoned shafts. This is flanked at the northern end by an embankment of earth sloping up at an angle of from 45° to 60°. Judging from appearances this is intended to be the roadway for the trucks bearing the ore obtained from the depths below by the trenching system, which it is understood to be resorted to in place of conventional mining. To the southwards an embankment has been commenced which onlookers presume is to be carried across the valley to meet the platform before spoken of and to make with it a roadway from the workings to the side of the hill, a distance of some 200-200 yards. The material is obtained from the vicinity of the platform and is transported on a crude tramway. The motive power coming from a small engine in a small shed on the hillside. Already some thousands of loads have been brought over, but as yet a wide gulf separates the embankment from the platform. Before it can be filled up an enormous pit will have been dug in front of the 45° to 60° slope before mentioned. It will be almost immediately above some of the old levels and the intention is probably to re-open these and enable all veins, leaders and lodes to be traced without the difficulties to which subterranean mining is subjected. Since operations have ceased according to the old plan, whole acres of ground have sunk appreciably. In many places gaping fissures are to be seen and in traversing the area one must exercise extreme care not to be engulfed. It is said there are scores of thousands of pounds worth of timber buried in the former workings, which will be recovered in the new workings. The present superintendent is discreetly reticent about just how the ore is to be raised and dressed. All well-wishers will united in hoping that the spirited attempt to restore the mine to its previous flourishing condition will prosper. The Directors have also decided to give their former tenants better tenure than previously available and the good effects of this policy will be shown in the erection of a better class of housing and in the establishment of some civic power to take in hand the formation of streets and the enforcement of sanitary regulations. The want of self-government has long been felt and ought to be supplied without delay. When the mine is once more in full swing, employing its hundreds of workers, and the agricultural settlement has reached in the North the extend to which it is believed it might advantageously be extended, the prosperity of Kooringa will be greater than ever.</p>

<p>Government Schools in 1869</p>
<p>The report of the Board of Education recognises that a complete reorganisation of Government schools is impending and acknowledges that as presently constituted they are totally inadequate to requirements. Data for reorganisation are being collected. The report includes 330 schools; 5 more than for 1868. 20 schools closed and 25 new ones opened. Only three of the new schools were in corporate towns, but six closures were in such places. The rule of the Board has been to maintain a minimum of three miles between certified schools; not an inconvenient distance for children to walk in a climate like this. Beyond the chief centres of settlement half time school have been trialled where sufficient pupils can only be found within a radius of six miles. A half time school has been tried at each end. The chief drawback is getting qualified men willing to undergo the extra drudgery of walking between the two schools. SA makes less use of young people as teachers compared with schools in the UK. There much of the instruction in the lower grades is done by youths, often mere boys, often for little more than the credit of a position which may lead on to something better. These volunteers make teaching a part of their own education. Here the average income of Government teachers seems high in relation to what obtains in England or America. Last year it was £103-13-4. But there is no discrimination on the value of the product. Teachers of roadside schools delivering minimal reading, writing and ciphering are paid as well as those delivering the best middle-class education. We have many excellent teachers who deserve more and scores of poor ones who are drawing men’s wages for boys’ and women’s work. [The article then goes on to elaborate on the benefits of using youths, with minimal pay for the simpler educational tasks.]</p>
<p>SA has never yet trained a teacher of its own. All have either been imported or improvised, or like Topsy they have grown fortuitously.</p>

<p>Easter Holidays passed quietly in Burra. Shops closed on Good Friday and Easter Monday and the usual tea meetings were held. There was an entertainment by the Rev. Stanton on Monday in the Burra Hotel Assembly Room. It drew an unusually large audience and the readings and music were excellent. [Program details are given.] £6 was raised to buy firewood for the poor of Kooringa.</p>
<p>An Entertainment. Mr Stanton and musical amateurs presented a pleasing entertainment at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday evening. [The program is printed.] A collection was made to buy firewood for the poor.</p>

<p>Captain Hart visited Burra and met electors at the Burra Hotel on 20 April to thank them for electing him. W.R. Ridgway took the chair. HE hoped to see money for education better distributed to aid the poor and hoped also to see an improvement in employment at the Burra Mine.</p>

<p>The Booborowie Correspondent says it is time they had a post office. The roads are so bad that the mail is often hopelessly delayed. Recently it left the Copperhouse Inn at the time it was due at Booborowie and then got lost. A person with a light had to pilot it back to the correct road. On the track further north the next day it became evident that it travelled directly only on mile in 16 and the rest in a zigzag fashion. On the way it dropped into a gutter where it lost the centre pin. Leaving the front wheels only attached to the horses. It eventually reached Canowie. The bad placed made by the floods are now getting worse.</p>

<p>Fire. It is thought that when two men left the Burra Institute last night they failed to fully latch the door. This blew open in an easterly wind and loose sheets of paper were ignited by a candle and soon loose periodicals were ablaze. Fortunately the fire was seen and extinguished before it had spread beyond the journals. A portico is needed to shelter the entrance when an easterly is blowing.</p>

<p>Temperance in Kooringa. No meetings are reported of the original Total Abstinence Society, but 21 additional names have been added to the pledge book and three cases of reformation reported.</p>
<p>Two Bands of Hope are operating. That of the Wesleyan Church has held nine meetings, obtained 25 signatures and numbers 137 members, with an average attendance of 80. The Bible Christian Band of Hope has held 23 meetings and during the year obtained 97 signatures, being the present number of the Band and three intemperate persons have been reclaimed. There is also an active Band of Hope at Copperhouse as well as one at Glendore (Black Springs).</p>

<p>Northern Mail Routes. A meeting at the Aberdeen Hotel on Monday discussed the changing of the starting point of these mail routes from Kooringa to Wetherston [Farrell Flat]. Mr A. Motley took the chair. He said the Government had placed a number of buildings in Burra, giving the impression that it was considered the entrepot for the north and people had reacted accordingly; a belief reinforced by the placing of the rail terminus there. The change would adversely affect the trade of the town; already in a depressed state. Wetherston had merely 20 farmers in the area, a squatter and an eating house.</p>
<p>[The report reveals that there had been petition and counter petition pushing the two rival routes; one leading north from Wetherston [Farrell Flat] to Booborowie and the other from Kooringa via Mt Bryan Flat.]</p>
<p>Mr O. Harvey said the proposed new route had a very poor road; he had recently been in its vicinity a week earlier when it appeared more like a canal and the mail would have been best carried by a flat-bottomed boat than by coach. The Government would have to spend thousands of pounds to make the proposed route serviceable. Finally the meeting passed a resolution moved by R.A.J. Müller ‘That this meeting pledges itself to use all constitutional means to carry out the resolutions carried by the Kooringa meeting on Wednesday, the 18th instant.’ Mr W. West seconded.</p>
<p>3 June 1870, page 5</p>
<p>Northern Mail Routes. On 2 June a deputation waited on Mr Todd the Postmaster-General to urge the route via Farrell’s Flat for the conveyance of the mail to Canowie and Blinman. The Farrell’s Flat area (with c. 100 farmers) was poorly served for mail with post offices up to 20 or 25 miles distant. The proposed route would be 10 to 12 miles shorter and the gradients much easier than from Kooringa. Mr Todd did not give a definite answer, though he seems to indicate he was leaning towards leaving the Blinman mail with Kooringa. A service for those between Farrell’s Flat and Booborowie would likely be by horse rather than by a vehicle. He would make a personal investigation of the roads before a final decision, or if that were impossible he would send a responsible officer.</p>

<p>Entertainment at Kooringa. The third of a series of entertainments to raise money for firewood for the poor was held at the Burra [Hotel] Assembly Room on Tuesday. It was largely attended despite the bitterly cold weather. [The program is outlined.] The collection amounted to £5 and the previous two entertainments raised £12. Mr Stanton said six tons of wood had been given out in the last month.</p>

<p>Burra Extension Railway. Next Thursday a special train will convey the Directors of the SA Mining Association almost as far as Redruth. The laying of the rails to the terminus has almost been completed.</p>
<p>24 June 1870, page 5</p>
<p>Burra Railway.</p>
<p>A Government party inspected the line on Thursday 23 June as far as it has been completed. They travelled in one of the new bogie carriages hauled by one of the new small engines designed for the line. [The official party is listed and included G.S. Kingston &amp; Henry Ayers.]</p>
<p>The weather was very bad, especially for a party which had at regular intervals to get out and make inspections of the line. It rained heavily all the way. Inspections were made at all the stations along the route. The train departed Adelaide at 9.30 a.m. and reached Smithfield at 10.10 a.m.</p>
<p>[The American bogie principle, seen on the new carriage, is then described; it being the newest such design seen in SA. The bogie is well adapted to sharp curves, but this line did not test it out as the sharpest curve is 30 chains and most are between 40 and 60 chains. Tarlee was reached at 12.30 p.m. and Riverton at 1.15 p.m.</p>
<p>The extension of the line begins at Forresters [Tarlee] and runs 461⁄2 miles up the valley of the Gilbert to Burra. It has been contracted to be built for £5,000 per mile. The line runs about 70 miles from the Roseworthy Junction. The first contract was let just over two years ago to Mr Haynes and ran almost seven miles or nearly to the Riverton Station. The rest of the line has progressed so rapidly that three contracts have been in operation at the same time. Some of the contracts have employed up to 250 men. Mr Bloomfield gained the second contract for 14 miles. He had previous experience on the Port Wakefield line. This carried the line to Manoora. Mr Walker carried on a further 14 miles to a point about a mile and a half beyond Farrell Flat. Messrs Fry’s contract for 11 miles then almost reached to the Burra terminus. The last half mile was let to Mr James Tiver, a local contractor when the final location for the Aberdeen Station had been decided. There have been five contracts for the earthworks and as many for the station buildings. The laying of the permanent way has been undertaken by Messrs Bond &amp; Morris. Most of the building contracts have gone to Messrs Schroeder &amp; Wishart, Sara &amp; Sons and James Tiver. The construction has been closely supervised and the relationships between contractors and engineers have been good. The result has been some of the best work done in the colony and for costs as low as the execution has been creditable. The gradients on the line are easy with the steepest 1 in 91. Although the terrain is largely flat considerable expenditure has been needed on culverts and bridges. The stations will be better than originally planned, but the improvements are in accommodation rather than external ornament.</p>
<p>From Tarlee to Riverton the land is generally flat and the steepest gradient only 1 in 100. The Gilbert is crossed on a girder bridge of 60 ft span. A similar bridge is needed about a mile beyond Riverton where the Gilbert is crossed again. At 131⁄2 miles a tributary requires another bridge of 45 ft span. [Further culverts etc. are then described to Manoora.]</p>
<p>Between Manoora and Farrell’s Flat the line encounters the most challenging cuttings and embankments. A double 30 ft span crosses the Wakefield. Despite the more broken country the maximum gradient has been kept to 1 in 91, but there are more of such gradients in this section. [Further details of culverts, cuttings and embankments are given.]</p>
<p>Including Tarlee eight stations have been erected on the line at an average interval of six miles. Tarlee has a stationmaster’s house and shed accommodation. Riverton will be the changing station, 313⁄4 miles from Roseworthy and 39 from Aberdeen. It is furnished with two platforms and a proportionate length of shelter. At Saddleworth a combination shed will serve both passengers and goods. Manoora and Mintaro both get a house, though the latter scarcely deserves its name, being some 4 miles from the town. Farrell’s Flat has a residence and extra length of shed. Daviestown [Hanson] gets only a siding for now. At Aberdeen, being the terminus, there will have to be more facilities. Besides the ordinary accommodation for goods and passengers, there will have to be shelter for rolling stock, an engine shed, a turntable, and an extra length platform. The latter will measure 300 ft and the goods shed will have a maximum length of 100 ft. The contractors are presently vigorously prosecuting this work.</p>
<p>The permanent way has been laid with rails of 40 lb per yard. The engineer would have preferred 60 lb rail, but it has been made uniform with the line to Roseworthy. Effort has been made to ensure maximum solidity by using sleepers of picked gum from Glen Para, 9 ft x 9 inches and 41⁄2 inches thick, spaced at 2 ft 4 inches and well packed on hard stone ballast. [Further details are given.]</p>
<p>The cost has been well contained and the estimated cost of £5,340 per mile including land purchase, survey, earthworks, permanent way, fencing, office expenses and rolling stock etc. is likely to be reduced to £5,000.</p>
<p>As for the inspection: the morning drizzle turned into a steady downpour by Roseworthy. The question of why the Wasleys station had cost the seemingly excessive £1,600 was explained by the Resident Engineer Mr Galt. The site required special foundations. (Though the question as to whether a masonry building was needed at all remains a moot point.) On a few of the party ventured out in the rain to get a view of the bridge at Hamley Bridge. The Riverton Station is a model for compactness and economy and has all the domestic and official arrangements under one roof. [The description is extended.]</p>
<p>The Saddleworth station is more modest without any domestic arrangements. There are two rooms on iron and timber separated by a space between that will have to serve as a promiscuous waiting room and luggage office. Here the special crossed the up train, which had departed Manoora at 1.30 p.m. At Manoora was another ‘combined shed’, which was inspected through the carriage windows as Sir George Kingston estimated the rate of rainfall at a quarter of an inch per hour. There is also a pump house. Mintaro was reached at about 3 p.m. and the visitors saw yet another galvanised iron shed. At Farrell’s Flat there is a pegged out township, which is expected to grow rapidly and spacious accommodation is being provided for future traffic. Provision has been made for sheep and wool, but wheat is expected to expand rapidly. A small band of workmen huddled under a shed to cheer the arrival of the special and even more lustily its departure. The train continued through Daviestown and its siding to the end of the line, about three miles from the intended terminus. The SA Mining Directors had arranged vehicles to meet the party here. The visitors rapidly transferred to the rather damp vehicles, which had been waiting since midday.</p>
<p>‘Everyone has heard, or, worse still experienced, what Burra can do in the way of mud, moisture, and nor’-westers. On Thursday all three of its special capabilities were at their full stretch.’</p>
<p>Above was nothing but torrents of descending rain and beneath nothing but torrents of rain tearing across the roads.</p>
<p>‘Every step of the four miles to the Burra Hotel was a jolting over ruts, a splashing up of muddy water, and an incessant struggle for man and horse against a storm which assailed then from all directions. It was, in short, Burra weather – a fit penalty for Burra Directors who had failed in their periodical visitations for a couple of years.’</p>
<p>All this was soon forgotten in the comfort of Lamb’s Burra Hotel. The Directors ‘are not in the habit of spending a dull evening at Lamb’s, and on Thursday they were no greater anchorites than usual. The near coincidence of the re-opening of the Mine and the completion of the railway served admirably for the inspection of both. At Burra the dismissal of workers and the contraction of expenses have given rise to apprehension, culminating in the actual stoppage of operations. Ever since the place has struggled on waging a desperate war with ill-fortune and hoping for a return of old times. This inspection, after an absence of two years, will revive the prospects of Kooringa. The township is brightening up. People are hopeful on a moderate scale and the investors are accepting with comparative readiness the improved terms of tenure offered by the owners of the Burra property. Some are taking up long leases and others are purchasing freeholds. The fruits of this changed policy should soon be seen, though it must be said as yet there is little to show for it.</p>
<p>‘The township seldom looked more disorganised and desolate that at present. The hovels, which have formed its ruling type of architecture, still line the hillsides in their native shapelessness, but in numerous instances the occupants are wanting. The stamp of depopulation and decay has been deeply impressed upon it, and it will take time to efface its traces.’</p>
<p>On Thursday the creeks had swollen to impetuous rivers. On Friday morning there was a temporary break in the rain and a party of 15 -20 headed by the Directors (Sir George Kingston, Mr Beck, Mr N. Blyth, Mr Bullock, Mr Jaffrey and Mr H. Rymill) headed off into a stiff breeze to inspect the mine. The engines and pumps are again being set to work. All the ponderous machinery, quiet for a couple of years, is being prepared for renewed action. But new processes and new appliances, involving a large outlay are to be introduced. Mr Darlington sketched out the plan of operation and Mr Swansborough has been engaged as manage to see it through to fruition. On his arrival the gigantic works now in progress were set on foot.</p>
<p>The first requisite was a level way across the wide gully leading to the Burra Creek. This is 63 ft high at the highest point and it will consist partly of a platform and partly of an embankment. It will be 15 feet wide and over 400 yards long. The platform has been raised, partly in wood, but principally of piping from Schneider’s Pumping Shaft. The embankment is being formed, though a couple of hundred yards yet remain to be filled. The material is coming from the open workings, a distance of 400 to 500 yards. The wagons to do this are running on a 2ft 3 inch gauge tramway. They are first drawn up the incline from the open workings with a strong cable attached to a horse whim. On reaching the natural surface they are on a movable platform which carries them to the principal length of rail. From here they are drawn 100 yards by horse power and then a 20 horse power locomotive engine drags them to the level of the embankment. Two wagonloads of about 11⁄3 tons apiece are drawn up at a time, the average draught per day being 100 tons.</p>
<p>Open working or trenching is the feature of the Darlington scheme. The hole is not cut perpendicularly, but an incline is left as a foundation for the rails upon which the wagons run. This is inclined at an angle of 28°. The workings have obtained a depth of about 10 fathoms. Usually the wagons are loaded from hoppers at the bottom of the trench, but on Friday the rains had caused some 100-150 tons of earth to collapse into the pit and this had to be shovelled into the trucks directly. Another 10 fathoms will have to be removed to reach the old diggings and ore. Here a floor will be formed. When the stuff above that level has been removed a further sinkage will be made and another level formed. At present water is up to the 20 fathom level in the old shafts, though that could easily be lowered. In driving among the old workings immense masses of wood will be released and it is anticipated many rich deposits of ore will be unearthed. Certainly an immense amount of lower grade ores, which had little store set by them in earlier days, will be encountered. Working on fissured ground above old workings requires great care. No one wants to fall into old tunnels or shafts, which riddle the area. Peacock’s engine will soon provide power to speed the construction of the embankment. When the embankment is completed the wagons will take the ‘deads’ or unwanted earth to be tipped over the side, while orey stuff will be taken to the dressing tower to go through sizing and jigging. [Details of this process follow.] 100 tons a day will be processed. The water used in the process is to be drawn from Morphett’s Shaft by its 250 horse power engine. At eight strokes a minute it can deliver 96,000 gallons an hour. [Further description of the processing follows.]</p>
<p>The full process will not be underway until August at the earliest. The Association is laying out some £25,000 to reopen the mine. There is, however, good reason to believe this outlay will be remunerative. It is thought that about 100 men will be employed.</p>
<p>After inspecting the mine some of the party continued on to the site of the railway terminus, about half a mile to the northwest. The reason assigned for locating the station here is the uncertainty of the future of the mine. They may find it most profitable to send their ore to the port. They may smelt it at the local works. The railway connection that best suits will be determined at that time and the present location will afford all facilities while that is pending. In the course of quarrying the refuse bank may be carried towards the railway and could form the groundwork for a cheap branch line, which the company would lay at its own expense. In the meantime the station is convenient for all three towns. The last mile or more of the line has yet received no rail and another mile or so has yet to be ballasted. Though there is little to complete, the present weather may cause delays and make an opening on 1 August, as anticipated, impossible. At present the mine does not require the railway and at present the only traffic would be wool and sheep. Sheep trucks have been ordered for the line and already the dozen in use are fully occupied on the open section, transporting an average of 2,000 per week and are booked for six weeks in advance. A dozen more trucks are on order. The sheep farmers will greatly benefit from the new line and it is thought the traffic would already justify a branch line to the cattle-yards.</p>
<p>At about midday the company assembled for the return journey and shortly after 12 the train departed, reaching Adelaide shortly before 5.30 p.m.</p>

<p>‘T.B.’ of Mt Bryan writes:</p>
<p>I call the attention of the Government to the state of the road north of Burra on what is known as Middle Camp Flat, which is at present nothing but a quagmire and all but impassable. It is almost level and could be fixed with little expenditure. It needs a drain on the west side and a deepening of the drain on the east side. A little spent now before the wool season commences would save a large expenditure in the future.</p>

<p>Agriculture. This has been one of the most favourable seasons for the Kooringa district. Feed is abundant, few cattle have died from cold and starvation in the wet and lambing has been most successful, though unfortunately not as numerous as might have been as farmers, fearing a continuation of the drought did not put rams into the flock at the usual period. Both graziers and agriculturalists are in good heart.</p>

<p>Obituary. At Mr Fuss’s house near the Burra Railway works on Thursday 21 July Henry Edmonds, a labourer on the line and formerly employed by the Smelting Works as a water carrier, ate a hearty meal and at about 8 o’clock complained of a pain between his shoulders, which he ascribed to wheeling barrows. He retired at 9 o’clock and at 5 a.m. Mr Frederick Fuss called him. The deceased said he would lie in a little longer. Within ten minutes he began to cry, breathe heavily and scream. Mr Fuss struck a light and found the deceased could not speak. He went for Dr Dashwood who was soon in attendance, but Edmonds died soon after Mr Fuss’s departure. An inquest was held at the Burra Hotel by W.H. Challoner JP. Dr Dashwood said a post mortem revealed the deceased had died from a diseased heart, the aorta having become perforated from ulceration. The liver was much diseased and probably caused the heart condition. The deceased had been a steady industrious worker, who had visited his native country with his family about four years ago, returning after some months. He had been at work on the line for some five weeks and expected his family to join him shortly. He was aged about 40. Verdict was that he died of disease of the heart.</p>

<p>The Northern Extension Railway. A meeting at the Miners’ Arms Kooringa on 25 July considered the causes in the delay of the opening of the railway. The roads between Kapunda or Manoora and Burra are in a deplorable state and the cost of heavy carriage has risen as a result. The tradesmen, knowing the mine machinery had been brought up by rail, wished the same privilege granted to them for the carriage of their goods. They passed a resolution asking that the line be opened without delay. They also resolved to ask that H.E. Sir James Fergusson open the line and that he and Lady Edith, the Ministry and the present and late members for the district and the Hon. J.H. Barrow be invited.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. Edward Gascoyne died suddenly at Burra. An inquest was held by W.H. Challoner JP. Dr Dashwood refrained from offering an opinion of the chemical contents of the stomach and intestines. The deceased had made a statement accusing Theresa Clark, alias Mrs Brown of poisoning him. While there is no suggested motive, the deceased had been suffering from severe cold for some days and inflammation of the bowels could have resulted. The inquest was adjourned to permit expert examination of the contents of the organs. [See further at 15 August 1870, page 3.]</p>

<p>Obituary: Mortuary Returns. Among the return of persons found dead in public places the following were found in the Kooringa district:</p>
<p>James Collins was found dead 19 February. He had died from heart disease and was attended by Dr Dashwood of Kooringa. He was aged c. 35, 5 ft 7 inches tall with light hair and beard. He was a native of Cambridge, England. He was commonly called ‘Sergeant’ and had a habit of playing a violin in the bars of public houses.</p>
<p>Thomas Anderson [of no fixed abode] was found dead [at Kooringa] on 1 May from natural causes. Dr Dashwood attended. He was last employed by on Mr Hile’s Station, Wangabbie and had been in the Royal Navy in 1810. He was 75 years old, with grey hair and beard and a native of Portsmouth, England.</p>
<p>15 August 1870, page 3</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest. On 3 August Edward Gascoigne applied to Dr Dashwood for medical advice. He said he had travelled from Adelaide in search of work as a butcher, but failing that had been working as a shepherd. He had been in the colony for 20 years. He appeared to be suffering gastric irritation, but was quite cheerful and had the symptoms of a simple bilious attack. The doctor gave him some medicine and he returned to lodge with a woman whom he called Mrs Brown, with whom he and a carter named Lindsay and Lindsay’s wife had travelled from Adelaide. He returned to the doctor the next day between 3 &amp; 4 p.m. in sickness with severe stomach pain and shivering. As Mrs Brown was going away, it was arranged Gascoigne would stay at a place for sick bushmen and the keeper of the house sat up all night with him. At 8 a.m. on the 5 August he made a statement that on Wednesday morning he lay in bed longer than usual and saw Mrs Brown, known as Theresa Clarke, with whom he had been cohabiting in Adelaide, and who came to Burra with him, sprinkle some powder into a pannikin of tea. He did not drink this, but he did drink one before going to the doctor the next day and from then on had become rapidly worse. Some five or six hours before his death he swore an oath that the woman had poisoned him. Some poison was found in the deceased’s swag, of which the woman had been in control. She was arrested and held in custody on a charge of murder. The inquest was held the following Saturday by Mr Challoner with Mr Samuel Corvosso Chairman of the jury.</p>
<p>Henry Lindsay, carter of Currie St gave evidence of the relationship of the deceased and the prisoner for some weeks in Adelaide. He never heard them quarrel and never heard Mrs Brown threaten the deceased. [He described their journey to Burra and the deceased’s weakened state due to a cold.] The deceased had tried to get Mrs Brown not to return to her husband, but to stay with him. He believed Clarke was her maiden name. The deceased had no money at all. When he had come to town he said he had been at Guichen Bay barking trees and the Tree Barking Co. had done him out of £15. [Much more detail is reported.]</p>
<p>Sarah Lindsay said she had been living in Adelaide with Henry Lindsay as his wife (but they were not married). Her father, Gordon Boyd, lives at Copperhouse. [Her evidence corroborates that of Henry Lindsay.]</p>
<p>Charles Hubbard, labourer, now living at Mrs Beale’s during his illness gave evidence of Gascoigne’s last hours. He heard him accuse Mrs Brown of poisoning him. Christopher Robertson was also then present. Robertson said the deceased had said three hours before he died that a woman had poisoned him, but he did not name her. Ann Beale gave evidence of staying up all night with the deceased and how he had told her the account of the powder in the pannikin etc. as above. He told her she went by the name Jemima Clark, but her proper name was Brown. [She gave further details of his conversation in which Mrs Brown’s word could be interpreted as confirming her role as a poisoner.]</p>
<p>Dr Dashwood’s evidence repeats the story in more detail.</p>
<p>On 5 August Dr Dashwood saw him in a very weak state and knew he was dying. Gascoigne then made his statement under oath accusing Mrs Brown of poisoning him. He had conducted a post mortem, but could not give further evidence on that because he had not had time to examine the contents of the stomach and intestines.</p>
<p>[The statement by Gascoigne is then printed in full.]</p>
<p>A telegram tells us that when the inquest was resumed on Saturday 13 August at 7 p.m. the evidence as to the completed examination of the organs was given and as a result the accused was remanded.</p>
<p>[But see 23 August 1870, page 3 reported the resumption of the inquest on 20 August.]</p>
<p>17 August 1870, page 5</p>
<p>An Entertainment. On 9 August Rev. L.W. Stanton gave one of his literary and musical entertainments at the Burra Hotel, which was even more largely attended than usual. [The program is listed.]</p>
<p>Mr Stanton said that the three previous events had raised £17, enabling the distribution of 18 tons of firewood to 45 needy families. A third had been in receipt of this necessary gift for 12 consecutive weeks and the others for lesser periods. He proposed that this entertainment and the next two should help to provide boots for poor children, many of whom were quite barefooted in this severe weather. The parents would be asked to pay half the cost in small instalments. Up to three children in a family would be helped provided they should regularly attend one school or another. £5-7-0 was collected. Another entertainment will be held in September.</p>

<p>The Opening of the Burra Railway. Arrangements are in hand to welcome the Governor and other visitors on 29 August. The goods shed has been placed at the disposal of the committee, who have arranged for a luncheon to be prepared there. Seventy invited guests are expected and in all some two or three hundred will probably attend the spread. Every effort will be made to secure a success and ensure a pleasing demonstration. The Concordia Band from Adelaide has been engaged for two days to play during the celebrations.</p>

<p>The Burra Railway. The Engineer-in-Chief and members of his staff paid an official visit of inspection to the Burra Railway on Saturday. Mr Mais himself drove the engine a great part of the way and carefully examined the line, which is now completed.</p>

<p>Obituary/Inquest. The inquest on the death of Edward Gascoigne was resumed on 20 August. Dr Dashwood was re-sworn. He said he saw the body three hours after death and made a post mortem examination. The body was very livid; the countenance very pinched; pupils dilated, indicative of intense suffering. [The evidence then goes on to describe the state of various organs.]</p>
<p>The deceased died from an attack of acute peritonitis. The symptoms of the disease very much resemble those of arsenical poisoning. He had removed the stomach and a portion of the other viscera and tested for arsenic, antimony and strychnine, but found no trace of any of them. He despatched the material to the Colonial Surgeon for a second opinion, but was clearly of the opinion that the deceased died of acute peritonitis of not more than 48 hours’ standing.</p>
<p>William Ey of Adelaide, analytical chemist, reported receiving the viscera etc. A white powder in the stomach proved to be magnesia. No trace was found of either mineral or vegetable poisons. The white powder in the prisoner’s box was carbonate of magnesia.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict that the deceased had died from natural causes.</p>
<p>The coroner then discharged the prisoner, quite clear of any stain upon her character, so far as the charge was concerned.</p>

<p>Opening of the Burra Railway. The formal opening of the new line will take place next Monday. The people of Kooringa are sparing no effort to make their special demonstration a great success. His Excellency the Governor and Lady Edith Fergusson, some of the Ministry, departmental officials and a large number of ladies and gentlemen have been invited and favoured with free passes by the Commissioner of Public Works. A train carrying first and second class passengers will leave Adelaide at 7 a.m., calling at all stations and expected at Burra Station at 12.30 p.m. The Governor will then declare the line open and will receive an address. Luncheon will follow in the goods shed at about 1 p.m. Toasts will be limited to allow the visitors to see the neighbourhood before rejoining the train at 4 p.m. There will be an entertainment in the evening at the Burra Hotel presented by Rev. Stanton and others.</p>
<p>Northern Roads are in a villainous state. The mail conveyance between Saddleworth and Clare sometimes takes two hours to travel eight miles. A friend who came down from Burra yesterday informed us that on part of the road he travelled he was five hours in making as many miles with a horse and spring cart, the horse plunging in stiff mud above his knees all the way.</p>
<p>29 August 1870, page 4</p>
<p>Opening of the Burra Railway</p>
<p>Today the inhabitants of Burra are to hold a high festival in honour of the opening of the Northern Extension Railway. This line to link the town with Adelaide has been under consideration for a quarter of a century, but its realisation seemed to keep on being remote. The mines prospered and the surrounding towns grew to house thousands, but still no practical attempt was made to link them with the seaboard by the power of steam. Even the provision of roads was of the scantiest description. Hundreds of teamsters made the regular pilgrimage, but Macadam was never propitious to them. Rough bush tracks gave them their general direction and they often had to navigate adjacent country in search of a better. The demands of districts nearer Adelaide had always to be met first. To this day the traveller to Burra by coach has the mournful experience of the fact that portions of the route have benefited little from any funds. It was not until the decline of the Mines that Parliament turned its attention to the Burra railway. Treasury was then in a thriving condition. The determination to extend the railways came at a time when the public building policy, since much abused, was popular. Many districts then spoke out for rail extensions. The northern areas were agitated by public meetings. Petitions from Kooringa and other intermediate localities recommended themselves to the Assembly. The line would have to pass through large tracts with almost unlimited agricultural potential and its terminus would attract the traffic of hundreds of square miles of pastoral country and it would monopolise the immense trade of a mine that promised to regain much of its celebrity through systematic management. The Bill was passed in 1867 and now the line is ready to be opened. The great building proposals generally have resulted in a debt of £600,000, with its attendant interest charges. The results have so far failed to deliver the great profits predicted. Railways have been extended from 70 to 193 miles. The line has been constructed at less than £5,000 per mile on average. Burra people expect that the line will usher in a new era for them. Agriculture, sheep farming and mining will all benefit greatly. A cloud has been lifted from Kooringa and the prospect of a brighter future has been opened to her.</p>

<p>The Overland Telegraph. Three of the parties organised for the construction of the overland telegraph will set out this morning for Mount Margaret. [Details are given.]</p>
<p>29 August 1870, page 5</p>
<p>The Burra Railway will be formally opened today as announced in Saturday’s issue. The train of invited guests will depart at 7 a.m., but the ordinary one will be allowed to precede it. Provision has been made for 500, but it is feared that this accommodation will hardly be sufficient. Not only will a large number assemble at the Adelaide Terminus, but accessions are expected along the route. The lavish hospitality of Kooringa folks will certainly be put to the test.</p>

<p>The Opening of the Northern Extension Railway: a History of the Line</p>
<p>While the desirability of a line to Burra was long acknowledged, the financial lessons from earlier construction discouraged an expansion of the system. Several surveys were carried out to select a route as preliminaries to Parliamentary approval. Eventually there was enthusiasm to extend railways and attention focused on a line from Roseworthy or Freeling up the Gilbert Valley towards Mt Remarkable. In 1866 a select committee decided it was worth immediate consideration. In 1867 the then Commissioner of Public Works, Mr Santo, supported by petitions from inhabitants, and sympathy in the House introduced a Bill to extend the line then authorised from Roseworthy to Foresters, to Redruth. The Bill was passed with great enthusiasm and a loan of £264,000 was specifically approved for this extension. The line from Roseworthy to Tarlee (Foresters) was built for a little over £5,000 per mile. Beyond the route takes 461⁄2 miles to reach Redruth following the course of the Gilbert through fertile agricultural country, much of it already taken up. The construction took two years and a few months. Compensation for land acquisition was kept to £110 per mile. Mr Haynes had the first contract for earthwork and masonry for 7 miles from Tarlee. Mr Bloomfield then had a contract for 14 miles and Mr Walker one for the following 14. Messrs Fry had the next 11 miles and Mr Tiver the last half a mile to the terminus. There are no major engineering challenges in the line beyond Tarlee; nothing to compare with the bridge over the Light at Hamley Bridge. The Gilbert and Wakefield are crossed with 60 ft spans. The masonry has cost about £400 per mile. [Details of earth moved and of cuttings and embankments are given.] Sleepers were supplied by John Rounsevell and are solid gum 9 ft long, 9 inches wide, 41⁄2 inches thick. 3,000 cubic yards of ballast is laid per mile, giving a depth of 8 inches. The permanent way is of wrought iron rails 40 lb to the yard. There are eight stations on the route and strict economy has been observed in their construction. They are plain, but where necessary good stone houses have been erected for the stationmaster. The goods sheds are generally roomy, being from 60 to 100 ft long by about 56 ft in width. They have stone foundations, timber framing, galvanised iron cladding and wrought iron principles for the roof. Extensive platforms have been provided and cranes and other facilities for large traffic, along with facilities to handle stock. Station buildings and associated features cost £14,500, which is rather more than estimated. The contractors for this work were Messrs Sara &amp; Son, Schroeder &amp; Wishart and J. Tiver. The fencing is in wire with cast-iron straining standards set at intervals of 600 yards. Intermediate standards are of T section wrought iron 14 ft apart. [Further details are provided.] The fence is strong and good, capable of resisting the ordinary pressure of small and great cattle and immune from damage by fire and requiring little in repair. At £340 per mile this exceeds estimates by £120 due to difficulties with the material supplied. Mr P. Galt the Resident Engineer has superintended the entire construction.</p>
<p>Two types of locomotive have been purchased; one for goods traffic and the other for passenger. The passenger service will use a light 17 tons (in steam) tank engine capable of hauling 120 tons on an incline of 1 in 100. The goods engines are tender engines of 18 tons in steam. Carriages are of the composite class with wrought-iron underframe, blackwood body framing and polished cedar panelling. They seat 40. The carriages have two 1st class compartments (one smoking), a luggage and brake compartment, a travelling post-office and three 2nd class compartments. Their weight including water is about 181⁄4 tons. Two bogie-tank vehicles have also been ordered to hold 1,000 gallons of water supplied to the locomotive by gravity. The goods wagons have wrought-iron under-frames and wooden bodies. They are designed to carry 7 tons. The cattle trucks also have wrought-iron under-frames and blackwood bodies. The carriages, some of the wagons and the sheep and cattle trucks were built in Adelaide, but 40 medium wagons were imported from England.</p>
<p>Arrangements have been made to supply water at Riverton, Manoora, Farrell’s Flat and Burra from deep wells supplying cast iron tanks. A line of telegraph is carried along the railway and this is nearly completed. The gauge is the standard 5 ft 3 inches for mainlines in the colony. Gradients are easy; the steepest being 1 in 91. Curves are also easy with the sharpest 30 chains. The cost of £4,946 per mile is well within the estimate of £5,340, but there will be extra to spend yet on rolling stock and goods shed and station accommodation at Riverton, Manoora and Mintaro when traffic demands them.</p>
<p>The Opening of the Northern Extension Railway to Burra</p>
<p>The date of Monday 29 August for this celebration was largely chosen for the convenience of MPs whose legislative duties would have prevented their attendance on the four succeeding days. The arrangements for the celebrations was entirely in the hands of a local committee of some 30-40 members chaired by Mr W.H. Rosman the manager of the National Bank in Kooringa. A considerable sum was raised to make the occasion a success. The railways provided a special train and the Commissioner of Public Works provided for free travel for invited guests and their lady companions, which ensured a greater influx of women than would otherwise have been expected. In the morning two trains were provided. The one was a special and the other might be termed a select. The demand for seats on the first was so great that eight new and old carriages had to be pressed into service and the public was stowed away in them without respect to class. The start had been announced for 7 a.m., but it got away at about 7.30 with between 300 and 400 passengers. [A handful of them are named.]</p>
<p>The select train with the Vice-Regal and Ministerial party got away soon after 8 a.m. [A list of the official party is printed.]</p>
<p>The Engineer-in-Chief drove the engine, which had been decorated with bunting and evergreens. The state carriage had been brought out to accommodate the Vice-Regal party. In the first two hours no accident occurred, but both trains were slow. The special reached Gawler at 8.40 and left after ten minutes at a sedate speed. It left Tarlee at 10.10 and was at Riverton at 10.30. At 10.55 the select train arrived at Riverton and after a moments discussion it was decided to send the special on ahead. Large crowds attended intervening stations to see the Governor and the Kooringa committee had pinned much of their hope for a grand occasion on his attendance.</p>
<p>At 12.45 p.m. the special reached the terminus. The buildings here include a station, carriage and goods shed and their erection has imposed no great drain upon the loan for the line.</p>
<p>‘For the sake of the levels the locomotive track has been laid some four or five feet below the natural surface, and this where still remaining afforded admiral standing ground for the spectators. Of these there was an amazingly large number assembled. The Burra and neighbouring townships had by mutual consent proclaimed a public holiday, and the people were determined to make the best of it. Whoever had been labouring under the delusion that the whole of the glory has departed from Kooringa should have an opportunity of seeing its aggregate population as it exhibited itself on Monday. It was not a few feeble sallow-complexioned men, women, and children who turned out to pay their regards to the Governor and take their change in the gratification of private curiosity; but a host of strong, healthy-looking men, hearty matrons, rosy-cheeked damsels, and a reserve of children such as only a mining community can boast of. Of course all the villages and locations within many miles of the place contributed to the crowd; but its chief explanation was to be found in the deserted aspect of Kooringa, Redruth, and Aberdeen. Dilapidated as these townships now look, the closing of doors and shutters, and the banishment of the population from the streets, gave to them an unusually desolate air, although even this was relieved somewhat by the decorations spread out in prominent situations. Veranda fronts were well nigh hidden under pine branches, and the housetops yielded a handsome crop of flags, many of them palpably new rigged for the occasion. In Market Square stood a triple arch, inspiringly decked with foliage, and breathing through half a dozen different transparencies words of welcome to the Governor and loyalty to the Queen and country. Across the main road in Aberdeen a second erection of similar character stood; while opposite his new railway store, Mr Tiver had hung out a line of streamers to dry. In Ludgovan-street [sic] Redruth, Mr Davey, of the Court-House Hotel, had at his own expense built a really tasteful arch handsomely festooned with evergreens, and adorned with banners and mottoes. It was intended as a rival to the Aberdeen Arch, and in point of looks was decidedly its superior, although its dimensions were smaller. But to return to the terminus. Not only were all the platforms and available standing ground near the station adorned with pine and wattle boughs, but the various buildings were set off with a bewildering display of evergreens, which might have been Birnam Wood come back to Dunsenane, [sic] as in the days of Macbeth. The Goods Shed had clothed itself in evergreen till it looked a monster bower – size 100 feet by 40 feet, and the Carriage Shed had blossomed into festive vegetation on a smaller scale. Its decoration had absorbed half a dozen good truckloads of material sent up from Wasley’s [sic] Station, while the Goods Shed, besides receiving its contingent from this distant forest of small trees, had occasioned havoc among the trees for 15 miles round. Fair hands had not been excluded from the pleasant task of preparing a welcome for the visitors extraordinary. Flags and streamers testified to their industry and all the colours of the rainbow vouched for the catholicity of the local taste. Inside and outside adornments were to be found, all resolving themselves into an effort to produce the most tasteful effect with the materials at command. There were wreaths of pine foliage, standards of pines and wattle boughs on the exterior, and flags and other decorations on the interior. The responsibility of the decorations belongs to Messrs Roberts and Ridgway whose zeal has been rewarded with great scenic effect. It has already been stated that the special train drew up at the station at a quarter to 1 o’clock. At 1 precisely the select carriages arrived and through one section of the crowd, which, all told, could not have fallen much below 3,000, His Excellency and party were conducted to a special reserve adjoining the cattle platform. After the spontaneous loyalty of the people had relieved itself in a round of cheers, and the local ordnance had fired an irregular salute Mr W.H. Rosman read and presented . . .’</p>
<p>[The following address. To which His Excellency replied. Mr W.H. Challoner JP presented an address on behalf of the Justices to which His Excellency also replied.]</p>
<p>‘The luncheon took place as arranged in the Goods Shed, which was most elaborately decorated for the occasion with flags and evergreens, and around the walls there were a number of appropriate mottoes suspended, including: “A Loyal Welcome to Sir James and Lady Edith Fergusson”, “Advance Australia”, “Science, the Handmaid of Commerce”, Capital and Labour Develop Our Resources”, The Flag on which the Sun Never Sets”, Our Staple Products – Wool Wheat, and Copper”, “There’s a Good Time”. The Concordia Band was stationed close by and during the progress of the meal, as well as at intervals between the speeches, played a variety of musical selections. The arrangements for the luncheon were entrusted to Mrs Lamb of the Burra Hotel, and they gave general satisfaction. At the close of the luncheon His Excellency was driven round to take a hasty view of the townships. At 20 minutes to 5 o’clock the select special train left Redruth [sic], followed, at no long interval, by the main train.</p>
<p>[On the journey to Adelaide a most unfortunate accident occurred and it is reported in detail in another section of the paper.]</p>
<p>The select train reached Adelaide at 9.40 p.m. and the other train some time later.</p>
<p>Back at Burra an entertainment was given at the Burra Hotel be local artists, except for the Concordia Band. A ball followed into the late hours of the morning.</p>
<p>[The Governor’s speech and the toasts etc. have not been noted, but a few comments from the latter follow:</p>
<p>Hon J.B. Neales MLC: If he could have had his way the railway would have arrived 16 years earlier.</p>
<p>‘He was quite prepared to admit, miner as he was, that agriculture was the first interest, and after producing wheat for their miners and wool for people at home, then came the third interest, namely the mining interest.’</p>
<p>W.H. Challoner JP: They were going to work the mine in the most scientific manner, and if they made discoveries they would have to go deeper and they ought to have 100 men engaged at the machinery with probably a thousand others employed on the works generally.</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat: We understood him to say that in one year the Burra Mine had paid the sum of £128,000 in wages alone.</p>
<p>Mr H.C. Mais, Engineer-in-Chief: He believed if the promise of a good season was fulfilled it would be as much as they could do to bring down the produce, especially as the far-famed Burra was also expected to be in full work shortly.</p>
<p>Accident/Obituary</p>
<p>While the special train conveying the Governor and party was on its way to Adelaide, and not long after leaving Farrell’s Flat, the engine-driver saw a man lying across the line, about 150 yards ahead. Utterly unable to check the train in time, he sounded the whistle repeatedly; but without effect. The passengers heard the signal, and looked out to discover the cause, but it was not until the engine had been brought to a standstill at a distance of three or four hundred yards from the body that the real state of the case became known. The train was at once driven back, and followed by His Excellency and the greater part of the male passengers Mr Mais proceeded to the scene of the accident. The body, which was now lying off the rails, presented a frightful appearance, one side of the forehead being absolutely smashed in, and other wounds being visible. Blood was flowing copiously, and the poor fellow, although alive, was utterly insensible.</p>
<p>[The report proceeds in considerable detail to try to account for the accident and to detail the transfer of the victim to Gawler where he was placed in proper care. The man was Thomas Attenborough, a ganger of Farrell’s Flat, who on this day had been acting as signalman at the first level crossing south of Farrell’s Flat. He was seen to be holding his white flag and then to have fallen across the line. It was thought he may have a fit, as he was said to be subject to them. He was married with five or six children. Oddly his death cannot be traced in the SA Deaths CD!]</p>

<p>Inquest/Obituary. (Courtesy of the Editor of the Gawler Times)</p>
<p>On Tuesday an inquest was held at the Criterion Hotel, Gawler West by Mr T.O. Jones enquiring into the death of Thomas Attenborough who died that morning, having met with an accident the previous day on the Northern Extension Railway. The widow was present.</p>
<p>Washington Mather said he was driving the train as it left Farrell’s Flat and saw a man waving a white flag at the second level crossing. This was a signal that all was well. Sounded the whistle and then glanced down at something on the footplate. When I looked around the deceased was lying about 100 yards from the engine with his head upon the rail. Reversed the engine, put on steam and whistled for the brake. We were travelling down slope at c. 20 m.p.h. and pulled up in about 300-400 yards. Got out and found the deceased lying on the road, off the rails. Believe the guard of the engine struck his head. Fancied he must have fallen in a fit. The Governor, Mr Mais and some others got down. Covered deceased with a bag, got him lifter onto the train and continued the journey. He had been placed at a level crossing to prevent accident to persons crossing. He was not in a dangerous position. It was about 10.05 p.m. and quite light.</p>
<p>Hannibal Orchard, Superintendent of the Permanent Way, Gawler, saw nothing of the accident, but confirmed the steps taken after it. Had known the deceased for about 11 years. Deceased was a steady man, and had never been seen the worse for liquor. The position was not dangerous, with a clear view of the train for half a mile and the train was stopped as soon as possible. The stoker was not present, but evidence was given that he had been on the other side of the engine. Mr Orchard said the stoker had confirmed that he had seen nothing. [This was hardly satisfactory as evidence and some of the jury wanted the stoker called. Although they were a minority the Coroner offered to call the stoker to an adjourned sitting after the other witnesses had been heard.]</p>
<p>Dr W.H. Popham saw the deceased at the station when the train arrived. He knew immediately from the damage to the frontal bone that there was no hope of recovery. He died soon after 9 a.m. the following morning. He could not determine if a fit had occurred. Thought the guard-iron of the engine rather than the cow-catcher had caused the fatal injury.</p>
<p>Mary Attenborough said they had been married about 12 years. Her husband had been good, kind and of sober habits. He was in good health and never took roo much liquor. She never knew him to have a fit.</p>
<p>William Clark, ganger, corroborated the deceased’s sobriety.</p>
<p>Mr Orchard said there was no public house at Farrell’s Flat, but could not say what other means there may have been of obtaining liquor. Inquest was then adjourned to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Aaron Solly, head porter, Adelaide, had been acting as guard on the train. His evidence did not add to the above.</p>
<p>The foreman Mr Matthew Henderson asked a Mr Frankel to be called, but he had seen nothing of the accident. Mr Grundy of the Bunyip said Frankel might shed some light on the matter. Frankel had been on the second train and he said he saw, as they came into Farrell’s Flat two railway men near the line very drunk and one had said ‘Our poor ganger is killed.’ Henderson said he believed that settled the matter, but Mr Orchard said the two were nowhere near the accident and if they had heard about it, it must have been from others who returned to the station afterwards. The coroner reminded the jury of the doctor’s evidence that there had been no indication of drink on the deceased. After some jurymen expressed dissatisfaction with the evidence the coroner asked them to consider their verdict. Eventually they decided death was the result of a blow from the engine, but there was no evidence to show how he came to be on the rail. They attached no blame to the driver and considering the 12 years’ service of the deceased recommended the Government make some provision for his wife and family.</p>

<p>An Entertainment was held in the large room at the Burra Hotel on Monday Evening. The overture was played by the Concordia Band. Mr Stanton read two pieces: Inviting the Governor to Dine and Mr Sprouts at the Lord Mayor’s Dinner. The latter in particular caused much merriment. [Other items are listed.]</p>

<p>Obituary. On 17 August William Lillywhite, a carpenter lately of Boolcoomatta in the Northeast was travelling to Kooringa in a dray with his wife and seven children. At Parnaroo while he was gathering his bullocks six of the children went looking for wild peaches in the scrub. They returned without their sister aged 5, whom they had thought was at the tent. It immediately set in bitterly cold and raining and continued thus two days and nights. Despite much local help in searching as well as their own endeavours no trace of the girl was found. Police and Aboriginal trackers were called in and the search continued without result for 14 days. The child had been born in the bush and never saw a town. She had been excited at the prospect of seeing Burra.</p>
<p>[This death does not seem to be registered, but the information above suggests she was Kate Lillywhite born to William and Kate nee Farrell on 14 July 1865 and registered as born at Boolcoonata North East.]</p>

<p>Kapunda’s loss. The opening of the Burra railway has reduced the Kapunda line from the main one to a branch. It reduced Kapunda’s direct communication with the north and has reduced the town to two mails a day to Adelaide. The local paper protests against the discontinuation of the noon train and wants a direct postal link with Tarlee to maintain proper communications with the north. A road eastwards to the Murray is another strongly desirable feature to keep the town growing.</p>
<p>Gawler Station. The local paper is concerned that with the opening of the Burra line passengers for the northern trains must cross a number of tracks to reach them. This is always dangerous and a light footbridge over the lines is needed before some fatality occurs.</p>
<p>Northern Mails. The new railway means that mail comes to Kooringa by train and the coaches for the north can leave some hours earlier than previously, getting over a considerable portion of bad road before dark. 26 August was the last day a coach ran between Kapunda and Kooringa. The last coach was an occasion of some éclat. The driver, Palmer, one of the most experienced whips was in charge of six in hand and a large number of residents saw them off. Mr Barnes the guard blew some unusually lively noted on his bugle. The road was in such a fearful state that the first-class team struggled to get through the mud. Now it has been replaced by the easy and speedy locomotion by rail.</p>

Attenborough Subscriptions

A list of subscriptions to aid the widow and children of Thomas Attenborough is printed.

[The Governor started the list with £3-3-0 and so far it totalled £46-2-6. Many managed £1-1-0 and the ever generous H.L. Ayers put in 10/6.]

Advt. Mr J.G. Lamb advises he will run a conveyance free of charge between Burra Hotel, Kooringa and the Railway Station, Redruth on the arrival and departure of the train. Breakfast will be prepared previous to the departure and dinner will be waiting the arrival.

10 September 1870, page 5

Burra Railway. The improvement in the transit of goods since the railway opened has not been as great as was hoped. The delay is frequently a week. It may be that carrying firms will not forward from Adelaide until they get truckloads. In any event horse teams delivered as quickly. Perhaps the complaints are premature and the difficulties will settle soon.

10 September 1870, page 5

Floods in the North. On Tuesday night the northern mail had to negotiate 20 miles of flood waters. It was very bad between Canowie and Booborowie. At Booborowie the eating house barely escaped flooding. The road from there to Kooringa was also very bad and it was a wonder it was negotiated, as the moon had set. There is also a very bad stretch of road at Mt Bryan.

Burra Mine. Operations are progressing slowly. The fixing of novel and extensive machinery is taking time. It is hoped full work will be possible in a few weeks.

Kooringa District Agriculture. The season is good with wheat never looking better and sheep and cattle in excellent condition. Destitution is on the increase, however, as the services of shepherds is dispensed with and employment hard to find. This follows the fencing of runs into large paddocks with large flocks permitted to run at large with only a boundary rider to look after them. After shearing has commenced labourers may become scarce and in the drier season men will be needed to help in the case of bush fires. We may reasonably fear a few from incendiaries.

12 September 1870, page 5

Entertainment. Rev. L.W. Stanton organised an entertainment at the Burra Hotel on 7 September to aid the family of the late Thomas Attenborough. The very stormy weather and muddy roads reduced attendance somewhat, but nevertheless £4-10-0 was raised. [The program is printed.]

19 September 1870, page 6

The Burra Demonstration Committee following the railway opening has a cash surplus and has decided to donate £10-10-0 to the Attenborough Fund and £5 to the United Sunday Schools Picnic. The Government has promised a special train for the picnic to take the children to some wooded spot near Mintaro ‘when many of them will for the first time see a tree and have ocular demonstration of a forest’. Each child is to take its own provisions and the Government will be asked to carry teachers and other adults at excursion prices. All places of business will be closed and a general holiday declared. If the Government agrees to these proposals the event should be held soon.

Tarlee. The village progresses and where two years ago there were no houses there now are 100 inhabitants.

Burra Mine

The half-yearly report of the SA Mining Association will be laid before the shareholders on 19 October. The operations in the last six months have been limited to making an inclined cutting to more readily reach the ore. The present length of the cutting is 162 ft and its depth is 74 ft. When the stope now in hand is finished it is intended to drive into ‘The Old Flat’ and commence taking off the top stope bodily. In the half-year 14,000 tons have been tipped 100 ft past the dressing tower. The erection of the new machinery has progressed so that haulage on the great scale and the simultaneous dressing of ores is likely to commence in the latter part of November. Experiments on processing low grade ores are still being made in London. Land is being let and sold in Kooringa. No produce has been obtained in the last half-year, so the usual profit and loss account is omitted. The mine’s establishment on 30 September was 9 mechanics, 24 miners etc., 6 labourers, 6 boys and 6 officers. Total 51.

17 October 1870, page 2

The Attenborough Relief Fund has reached £217-12-3.

21 October 1870, page 5

Tornado. [A squall is described in the paper, but it seems clearly to have been a small tornado.] On Sunday a squall line 50 to 100 yards wide and perhaps 200 yards long crossed part of Kooringa. Part of Mr Dyer’s house in The Paddock was unroofed, then travelling southeast it whipped the verandahs off Snell’s house and badly damaged Mr Fogg’s roof. At Dyer’s the inhabitants were startled by the noise and a crash, the room filled with dust and the carpets were lifted from the floor.

Agriculture. The crops are very promising. Wheat is in places nearly four feet high and a dark healthy green colour. Should rust not appear and other conditions remain good yields of up to 30 bushels per acre seem likely. Showers of rains continue to fall and there is no sign of the crops changing colour yet.

24 October 1870, page 6

The Children’s Picnic. The cost of the special train etc. turned out to be so great as to render it impractical. In its place a Monster Picnic was organised in Mr McCulloch’s paddock at Princess Royal. Last Monday almost every available vehicle was pressed into service to convey the children and adults to Princess Royal and by midday perhaps 800 people were assembled there. A public subscription supplied the youngsters with tea and cake and other refreshments, while the adults took their own provisions. The crowd began to return from about 4 p.m. Two slight accidents occurred on the return, though neither resulted in injury. A cart was badly damaged when the horse bolted after the driver had alighted. In the other case a wheel came off.

Miss Thorne has been preaching to good congregations through the week.

31 October 1870, page 5

Obituary/Flood

On Wednesday a very heavy fall of rain caused the culvert in Commercial Street to overflow. The main street was flooded and the fine material washed off the surface. Some low-lying houses were flooded. At about 11 p.m. a woman residing near the creek behind the Miners’ Arms heard screams. She thought they were from a person whose home had been flooded. The next day there were rumours that a person had been lost, but no one was reported missing. The other evening a boy rode in to town and reported a corpse stuck in a tree in a creek on Princess Royal. The police have not returned as we go to print. The only person missing is a bushman who left the Miners’ Arms a little before 11 and has not been heard of since. Under the circumstances it seems he is likely to be the corpse in the creek. On Friday the very wet weather continued and the creeks rose further. A man from Auburn was nearly drowned trying to cross the stream near Pinch’s paddock. His horse and cart were submerged, but he escaped after cutting the harness and was able to reach land with the animal.

[Patrick Coy died 25 October 1870 at Kooringa aged 24. BISA research says he came from Offaly in Ireland and arrived in 1858 on the General Hewett.]

31 October 1870, page 6

Booborowie. Wool from here and beyond is going to the railhead at Burra in abundance now that the cessation of rain has made the roads passable.

2 November 1870, page 5

Obituary/Flood. The efforts of the police to recover the body seen at Princess Royal on Friday have been unavailing. Mr Challoner had sent a lad to try and find a trough that the flood had washed away on Wednesday. He saw a body partly exposed in the water and from its small hands and long black hair thought it was a woman. No woman has been reported missing. Before trooper Dunne could retrieve the body more rain caused the creek to rise and apparently the corpse was washed away. The water has prevented a thorough search, but Lance-Corporal Smith is out with drags. The bushman previously mentioned has not been heard of since the flood.

4 November 1870, page 5

Obituary/Flood. Lance-Corporal Smith has returned without a body. The stream is deep in many places and a strict search is not presently possible. Immense quantities of sand have been washed from the creek near the mine and the body might well be covered, perhaps never to be seen again. The missing man’s name is either Patrick or John Coy. He has left a small sum in the hands of the landlord at the Miners’ Arms.

8 November 1870, page 5

Inquest/Obituary. On Saturday lance-Corporal Smith discovered the body of a man believed to be Patrick Coy, lying in a waterhole about two miles from World’s End Station. At the inquest Samuel Davis ostler at the Miners’ Arms, said the about 11 p.m. on the night of the flood the deceased was in the house and asked the landlord for a candle. The latter did not hear him and went away. Deceased walked down the passage and into the back yard at the end of which is the unfenced bank of the Burra Creek. The creek was flowing fast about 3 ft deep and 80 ft across. Soon afterwards cries were heard from behind Mr Hutson’s premises. William Watts, Mr Dawson and the ostler tried to help, but in the darkness could render no assistance. The jury returned a verdict ‘That the deceased, supposed to be Patrick Coy, was found drowned.’

14 November 1870, page 3

Redruth Court

Ann Macarthy was charged that on 5 November she had wilfully and maliciously cut and maimed Thomas Moore at Kooringa. Mrs Bridget March, separated from her husband, said that on Saturday Moore had come to her house at about 7 p.m. Macarthy was there. A dispute arose between them and after Macarthy had used insulting words Moore told her to leave and forced her out of the door. An hour later the accused returned. Moore told her to go home and mind her ‘bastard’. He again tried to put her outside, but she grabbed a butcher’s knife and struck Moore across the face nearly cutting off his nose. They had all been drinking beer and Mrs March thought Moore was not sober. Thomas Moore corroborated the assault. Dr Dashwood gave evidence that he had sewn up the wound, which was not dangerous and would only leave a scar when it healed. Macarthy was committed to the Supreme Court.

David Edwards and William Rabbich were fined 5/- plus costs for removing stone from crown land at Farrell’s Flat.

Cox and Clode were fined 10/- each for furious riding in Kooringa streets. Collins was fined 5/- for unlawfully riding on a dray.

29 November 1870, page 5

Burra Mine. We are informed that fires were lit under the boilers of the pumping engines on Monday 28 November. There is a large accumulation of water to be got under, and if the pumping apparatus is in order there will be no further delay to reducing it and getting regularly to work. The large embankment has not yet been completed, but operations at the dressing-house will shortly be commenced.

1 December 1870, page 5

A Mill Wanted at Burra. The Burra correspondent writes urging the need for a flour mill at Burra. He says there is an engine standing idle at the Bon Accord Mine and sheds nearby that would hold the necessary apparatus.

Agriculture. The crops for twenty miles to the north are in excellent condition. There is no blight and some wheat stands five feet high and this in a district which only a few years ago was said to be unfit for agriculture. A competent judge has inspected many farms and expects the yield to be between 20 and 30 bushels per acre.

16 December 1870, page 4

Accident. Messrs Hudson &amp; Builder were returning to Kooringa from Farrell’s Flat on Sunday at about 8 p.m. when the horse shied near the Burra Hotel. Both gentlemen were thrown out and the cart overturned. The horse was on his back and Mr Hudson was pinned under a rail until help arrived. Mr Builder escaped with a shaking. Mr Hudson has also recovered, having been protected by the ironwork of the seat-rail from receiving a fractured skull.

Agriculture. Some land near Gum Creek is said to have yielded 35 bushels per acre. This is exceptions and although reports vary considerably, it is thought an average of 20 to 25 bushels per acre is likely.

24 December 1870, page 4

Editorial: Burra Mine

Comparatively few people realise that the SA Mining Association does not have it origin with the Burra Mine. It was formed before that body of ore was discovered and its object was simply the general pursuit of mining in the colony. It had a modest capital and several areas of supposedly promising land were being investigated when the discovery was made that led to such speculative excitement. The first indications of copper in the neighbourhood were found by a shepherd employed by Mr F.H. Dutton, who in 1845 found some specimens on what was later the Princess Royal property. Some months later a bullock driver named Thomas Pickett discovered ore near present day Burra. He was in the employ of William Robinson, then of Gum Creek. At the time the only way to secure the mine was a by the purchase of 20,000 acres of land as a special survey at the fixed price of £1 per acre. One half the sum was understood to be forthcoming from a few gentlemen who acted together and who afterwards became the proprietors of the Princess Royal. Raising the other half proved difficult. Eventually with the aid of the SA Mining Association it was raised. When the survey was drawn up it was resolved to divide it into two equal parts by lots; the two groups being called the ‘nobs’ and the ‘snobs’. Fortune decided in favour of the latter, who selected the northern half. The SA Mining Association was enlarged to include the new proprietors and the new blood set vigorously to work developing the new mine. Early returns from surface workings exceeded their most sanguine expectations. Shares rose enormously in price and their value was soon put beyond doubt by the payment of large dividends.

During the first half-year to 30 April 1846 2,959 tons of ore was raised at a cost of £5-7-7 per ton and sold for £12-1-1 per ton for a profit of £6-13-6 per ton or a total of £19,751-10-2, nearly twice the purchase price of £10,000. In the next 12 months they made a profit of £62,034-13-0 and this dazzling state of success continued for several years. The profits for the 12 months to March 1851 being over £115,000. Then the Victorian gold-fields lured miners away. The next six months’ profit was £50,000. The six months to March 1852 yielded less than £37,000 and then the following 12 months less than £12,000. After that things improved again. The annual profit at each successive March being:

1854 £25,000 1855 £27,000 1856 £96,000

1857 £43,000 1858 £39,000 1859 £45,000

1860 £30,000 1861 £17,000 1862 £20,000

1863 £24,000 1864 £30,000

1864 was the last year of real prosperity. The costs of raising ore and the price obtained for it were gradually approaching each other. In the next six months the mine made a profit of £12,778, but then the following six months produced a loss of £634. September 1865 saw a profit of £3,520, but this was swept away in the next three years with losses totalling £26,000. It was by then costing £14-1-3 to £15-8-0 per ton to raise ore that sold for £11-4-4 to £13-5-0 per ton.

After 23 years of operation 220,173 tons of ore have been raised, averaging 22% equal to 49,310 tons of copper. During the period copper averaged £92 per ton. Allowing for freight and other losses the actual value to the company is probably about £4,000,000.

The actual profit made was £871,594 of which £776,160 has been distributed to shareholders in 55 dividends, or £315 on each £5 share of subscribed capital.

‘Figures, however, cannot show all the benefits which arose from the working of the Burra Mine. Its effect upon the depressed and struggling colony was absolutely talismanic. New roads, new towns, new industries, sprang up in succession, and a period of prosperity commenced, which was only checked for a time by the gold discoveries in the neighbouring colonies. The temporary closing of the Burra Mine has been simultaneous – though but partly connected – with another period of depression; and perhaps it may not be too much to hope, in the prospect of an abundant harvest, that its reopening may accompany and perhaps partly aid in occasioning a renewal of South Australian prosperity.

3 January 1871, page 4

Burra Burra Mine Shares. A report on various shares shows the Burra Burra Mine £5 shares were then valued at £27 and the last dividend had been paid in December 1864.

3 January 1871, page 5

Burra Mine. Fires were lit under the engine on 30 December 1870 and the new lift responded admirably. It is expected the water will be sufficiently ‘in fork’ in a few days to allow the dressing machinery to be tried.

5 January 1871, page 6

Weather. Unusually, over an inch of rain has fallen since last Thursday, but no damage to the wheat harvest is expected unless a strong hot wind follows.

Burra Mine. On Wednesday Captain Paull fell down an abandoned shaft, which had been covered with timber. He fell about 36 feet, but has survived with a severe shaking.

6 January 1871, page 5

Burra Mine. The water at the Mine is nearly forked to the required depth for the dressing machinery to be tested.

9 January 1871, page 7

Christmas. There were no public amusements on Christmas Day. Shops were open on the 28 December, but closed for a holiday on 2 January when picnics were commonly indulged in.

The United Friendly Societies held a picnic in Mr Need’s paddock four miles south of Burra on the Adelaide Road. Among the sports played was a 150 yards foot race for men and a 150 yards foot race for boys under 15.

W.H. Vivian cleared 4 ft 7 inches to win the high jump and T. Threadgold won the hammer throw. E. Topperwein came first in the blindfolded men’s wheelbarrow race, with A. Schmidt winning the similar event for boys. There was a three-legged race and hunting the pig with a greasy tail. A band from Gawler played for dancing. W.F. Coglin umpired the sports and attendance was 500-1,000.

In the evening a Musical Entertainment saw the Burra Hotel Assembly Room filled to capacity. Rev. Stanton rendered his noted recitation Drat the Cats. There were items from a group of Christy Minstrels. W. West of Redruth wrote an appreciated prologue and Dr Dashwood JP presided.

Agriculture. Reaping continues apace and in places yields in excess of 30 bushels per acre are reported. Lowest yields are about 12 bushels per acre and the average seems likely to be about 20 if the weather holds.

Captain Paull is making a recovery under Dr Dashwood’s attention.

16 January 1871, page 3

Booborowie. Wind, rain and cool weather have reduced the harvest somewhat. A problem is that smaller farmers have too few horses to work quickly when bad weather threatens. Losses of 6 bushels per acre are reported – valued at 3/6 per bushel. [The writer offers some suggestions on how to avoid such losses in the future, or at least to minimise them.]

20 January 1871, page 3

Farrell’s Flat. The harvest is coming in. Messrs Box &amp; Hudson of Kooringa have just completed a handsome and roomy store 66 ft x 33 ft in limestone with Kapunda stone dressings. This will provide a much needed market for wheat and a source of supply for general goods. Mr Bleechmore of Mintaro is just completing a neat public house in limestone with Auburn bluestone dressings. Stormy weather has retarded reaping, but the yield should still be about 20 bushels per acre.

Inconvenience is occasioned by the naming of the railway station Farrell’s Flat and the town Hanson. Surely one name would have been sufficient.

27 January 1871, page 6

Farming. The district is likely to average about 20 bushels per acre despite recent adverse weather.

Burra Mine. The machinery is gradually being brought into use. Some initial difficulties were experienced in operating the incline due to inexperience, but now it is running evenly and regularly. The waste is being formed into an embankment adjoining the incline and at the other end of the embankment is a dressing tower where the ore being dressed falls perhaps 40 ft. This part is not yet fully operational.

11 February 1871, page 5

Weather. Clare had 2 1/14 inches [fraction unclear] of rain on Monday, which damaged wheat in the fields. At Redruth floods destroyed the ford, which had been greatly damaged by a flood a few weeks earlier.

Redruth Bridge is in a fearful state with a hole in the middle at least four feet square. Strangely no steps have been taken to caution travellers.

27 February 1871, page 7

SAR. Railway regulations are printed along with timetables for passenger trains.

A complete timetable for the northern line with all stations listed is printed. It reveals for Burra:

Down Trains

Depart Adelaide 7.00 a.m. 10.45 a.m. 4.30 p.m.

Arrive Gawler 8.10 a.m. 12 noon 5.40 p.m.

Arrive Burra 12.30 p.m.

Class 1, 2 &amp; 3 seats are available to Gawler, beyond which 3rd class passengers transfer to goods trains. These depart Gawler 1 p.m. and depart Burra for Adelaide 5 a.m.

Up Trains

Depart Burra 8.15 a.m.

Arrive Adelaide 2.05 p.m.

A table of the fare structure for the line is printed.

Adelaide-Burra 1st Class 25/3

2nd Class 19/-

3rd Class 12/9

3 March 1871, page 5

Agriculture. Harvesting is over and the yield has been good despite hot winds, with many getting 20 to 25 bushels per acre. The northern lands are rapidly being opened up. A few years ago this district was deemed unsuitable for tillage, but experience has proved the land equal to that of our neighbours, especially since rust is unknown here. Dray-loads of wheat are arriving continually at the Burra Station and much has already been forwarded.

9 March 1871, page 5

Mt Bryan. Mr Henry Clode reports from Redruth on 8 March that he went with Mr E. Foreman to investigate reports of gold having been found at Mt Bryan. Mr Dare said he had found none on his station, but had a few specks in a bottle from a man who had been washing for gold at Ulooloo. Clode and Foreman found no evidence of gold in the creeks around Mt Bryan and the survey party at Ulooloo also reported finding none there, though others had found small traces, but no in payable quantities.

10 March 1871, page 6

Booborowie. Reaping in the area has finished. Agricultural land in the area has been taken up and for 20 miles north. Further northern extensions would encounter rising transport costs. Wheat 40 miles north of here would cost 6d per bushel for cartage to Farrell’s Flat and 8d per bushel from Farrell’s Flat to Adelaide. The new monster shed at Farrell’s Flat has proved inadequate and would still be so if three times the size.

21 March 1871, page 7

Ulooloo. [There is a report from Mr Peterswald, the Warden of the Gold-fields, confirming that some gold has been found at Ulooloo. The ground looks promising and Mr Wescott has marked out a prospecting block 200 yards square. A reef is reported from Banbury Scrub and Mr Brayley, a farmer near Wescott’s, reports that his son found some gold in 1870. Despite the indications the Warden warns that gold has not yet been found in payable amounts.

23 March 1871, page 5

Ulooloo. There is a further report of 1 dwt of gold having been obtained from a tub of washdirt, but the warning is repeated that the field is as yet unproved.

28 March 1871, pages 5 &amp; 6

Ulooloo Gold-fields

[There is a report at some length from a correspondent, on the Ulooloo Gold-fields.]

Mr Dare emphatically denied reports a few weeks ago that gold had been found on his run. Other information prompted an investigation by Warden Mr Peterswald. The route to the area follows the North Eastern Mail line from Burra to Willogoleech and then more easterly to Mr Chewings’ Station. I saw 11⁄2 oz of gold washed out by Mr Westcott and two mates on the claim about half a mile south of Mr Chewings’ head station. Others have also pegged claims. I found traces of gold in all samples I washed. Others were not as consistent, but had found gold, while some had found nothing at all. There are unconfirmed reports that some gold has been found on Mr Dare’s run.

[The correspondent sums his findings up as being able to dismiss claims that the area had been ‘salted’. He says the district has all the signs of being an auriferous region. He says the land is fortunately as yet unalienated. He goes on to recount the natural resources available for fencing and hut building and says there is no scarcity of water. He considers the alluvial deposits seem likely to enable a man to ‘knock out a living’. He seems hopeful that a real gold-field could develop.]

Almost nothing is known of the quartz reefs in the area. I caution travellers against a large and entirely unprotected hole in the Redruth Bridge, through which two horses have already fallen.

[Mr W.J. Peterswald’s report is printed also. This essentially confirms the above, with a little more detail, but seems to make no recommendations about the likelihood of there being a payable field there.]

30 March 1871, page 8

Advt. There is a long and quite detailed advertisement for the English &amp; Australian Copper Co., which was clearly selling off its assets, particularly those along the old Copper Road from Burra to Pt Wakefield. In brief the lots were:

Lot 1. Whyte Park Farm Tothill’s Creek of 325 acres.

Lot 2. Sections 367 &amp; 368 Hd Waterloo at Apoinga.

Lot 3. Logan’s Gap Station Apoinga comprising sections 96, 97, 98, 99 &amp; 100 of 792 acres.

Lot 4. Gum Creek in Co. Stanley: sections 2287 &amp; 2290

Lot 5. Kadlunga Farm near Mintaro.

Lot 6. Ross’s Creek near Kapunda.

Lot 7. Wheal Schneider: section 2178 adjoining Karkulto Mine.

Lot 8. Whitwarta.

Lot 9. Skillogolee Creek

Lot 10. Hoyle’s Plain.

Lot 11. Wakefield Bridge near Dunn’s, adjoining the township of Kouth.

Lot 12. Six-Mile Station on Pt Wakefield Road.

Lot 13. Two-Mile Station: one mile from Pt Wakefield.

Lots 14-20 were all in or around Pt Wakefield.

Advt. Auction: In the Hundred of Dalkey, section 2093 at Dunn’s Bridge on the River Wakefield, with the hotel known as The Bridge Inn.

3 April 1871, page 5

Ulooloo Gold-fields

Mr Coglin, the Crown Ranger, reports Wescott’s party obtained 1 oz of gold after 4 to 5 hours washing. They are attempting to trace the lead back to the hills. There are reports of others finding payable quantities, but also many reports of parties from Burra returning disappointed. Much of that may be due to unfitness for the work, lack of tools or inexperience.

14 April 1871, page 3

Easter at Burra.

Monday was dull and with drizzling rain.

The Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary was held. On the Sunday Mr James Scott of Adelaide preached. The children’s singing was very good. Some £30 was raised for Sunday school use.

The Church of England Sunday School pupils had a ride to Princess Royal where they were received by Mr McCulloch.

There was a Musical Entertainment one evening at which the Amateur Christy Minstrels delighted a crowded audience. Over £10 was taken at the door.

On Good Friday the Wesleyans held a tea at Mt Bryan Flat to raise funds to build a chapel there.

15 April 1871, page 5

A Tinkettling at Marrabel got out of hand. Window glass was broken and the timber frames shattered. Doors and the roof were also damaged. Those responsible were taken to court. The magistrate permitted the case to be withdrawn when the accused agreed to pay all court costs, make an apology, and pay £20 damages.

Burra Burra Mine. 26th Annual Report.

Works designated by Mr Darlington for open cut working are nearly completed, so as to allow orey stuff to be at once removed. In the last half-year 15,000 tons of stuff has been tipped and this would have been much more, but for an accident to Morphett’s pumping gear requiring a new plunger and drawing lift. The Mining Association’s tenants continue to renew leases or to purchase their holdings. Experiments have been made in London on processing the large deposits of orey sand that have accumulated in Burra Creek. Machinery is being purchased to handle it. Experiments have also been made on recovering copper from other waste as well by means of dilute sulphuric acid. Conditions are currently favourable for the company and if the value of copper continues to improve the Directors have little doubt they can soon report satisfactory results. The profit and loss account shows a nett balance of £17,905-16-5. The total assets of SAMA are £79,534-7-6. Cash available for future works exceeds £10,000.

24 April 1871, page 5

‘Bushman’ writes concerning the fencing of runs.

[He is concerned that as greater portions of runs are fenced employment in the industry has fallen. Once where 15 to 20 men were employed, the work can now be done by 2 to 4. These hands cannot readily be transferred to agricultural jobs because there are plenty of men already with the skills of ploughing and reaping, whereas these men are adept at hut building, well-sinking and dam-making. There will be a large group of unemployed to become a burden on the state. Trade will decline because of the loss of income by so many workers. He also considers that the change is of doubtful economy because the loss of sheep dying through not getting to water and the breakages in wire fencing will more than balance the savings in wages.

1 May 1871, page 3

Ulooloo Gold-fields. About twenty men are employed at the diggings. An experienced digger there believes the discovery of a good reef cannot be far off and there is every hope of finding a rich deposit.

2 May 1871, page 3

William Smith writes in response to ‘Bushman’ of 24 April.

[He writes in dialect and takes an opposing position. Many of the displaced workers were good fordoing very little and those displaced should take the opportunities being offered in the new land being opened up on Eyre Peninsula and elsewhere.]

9 May 1871, page 4

Wheat Yields 1870-71 Season

The Burra [County] has nearly doubled its wheat area since the harvest of 1869-70 and reports for its 6,345 acres an average yield of 17 bushels 10 lb per acre. Thousands of acres have yet to be planted in this county, but they are rapidly passing into the hands of farmers.

[60 lb of wheat in 1 bushel.]

12 May 1871, page 3

Court Case. There is a report of the arrest by Lance-Corporal Smith of a man called Barry. The accused was pursued some 35 miles to the east from Burra towards the Murray and arrested at Government Well Station. Barry and his mate were said to have sold three or four horses in Kooringa, stating that they had brought them from the Darling, when they had actually been stolen. Mr Challoner JP committed the accused for trial.

[There are other details and charges outlined.]

16 May 1871, page 6

An Entertainment was staged at the Court House to raise money for a poor invalid. Rev. L.W. Stanton as usual gave an inimitable reading and other recitations were given by Messrs Lipsett, J. Burns and Carvosso. Messrs Musard and Emery sang. Mr Hodge sang his own composition on the opening of the Burra Railway. Mrs Smith and her young pupil Miss Coglin played instrumental pieces and in all £8-1-0 was raised.

Redruth Bridge. The SA Government has agreed to a pound for pound subsidy on sums donated to mend the Redruth Bridge, up to a maximum of £50. A few people yesterday subscribed £20 so repairs can soon be expected.

A District Council. There is some talk of petitioning for a District Council for Burra.

Agriculture. Farmers have benefited from recent rains.

Burra Mine. One day last week machinery enabled men to break orey stuff, fill and empty 430 trucks each of 11⁄2 tons capacity; each having been hauled about 6 chains and elevated 130 ft with the assistance of the ‘fire whim’. The engine could do more work if there were more room for the labourers to break the stuff.

Obituary. Surprise and regret was expressed at Kooringa on hearing the news of the decease of the late John Winnall. While residing at Burra some years ago he won, by his Christian principles and unobtrusive generosity, the highest respect of his fellow townsmen and great sympathy is extended to his widow. On arrival of the train on Thursday his remains were interred in the family vault at the Burra Cemetery where several of his children have already been entombed.

Agriculture. Further useful rain has made a good start to the season.

Redruth Bridge. £25 has now been collected towards the repair of the bridge.

Mt Bryan. The foundation stone for the Bible Christian Chapel was laid on the Queen’s Birthday. Many travelled from Kooringa for the occasion. The ceremony was conducted by Rev. J. Rock. A hymn was sung and there was a reading from Ezra 3 [which deals with the building of the Temple in Jerusalem after the Babylonian captivity.] A document was placed in a cavity and the stone laid by Mr James McLeish, resident and trustee. Tea was then provided by the ladies in a tent. A public meeting was then chaired by Mr Clapp. The chapel will be in the Gothic style 18 ft x 28 ft and 14 ft to the ceiling.

St Mary’s Anglican Church in Burra has been renovated and the re-opening services were held on Sunday. The Bishop of Adelaide preached. On Monday he delivered his well known lecture on Slavery at an entertainment at which locals provided songs and musical items. Proceeds went to the repairs fund. A proposal has been mooted to build the Redruth Church for which £300 is on hand. Foundations were laid for this many years ago and walls raised 3 to 4 ft before the work was halted. Now with the railway station at Redruth [sic] and the parsonage [rectory] nearby and such a sum on hand, it seems reasonable to carry out the project. Some have suggested a different site on the Mine Hill near the Hospital.

[Note: at this period a reference to the Hospital means the Mine Hospital, known as ‘Bleak House’.]

15 June 1871, page 5

St Mary’s, Burra. A recent church warden was given a sum of money in recognition of his four years’ service as harmoniumist. He has generously deposited the sum in the offertory bag to go towards the repair costs of the church.

30 June 1871, page 5

Agriculture. Rain so far has been good and well spaced. Wheat looks good and in the Kooringa district alone it is thought there is an increase of c. 25% in land under the plough compared with last season. The new land has been under sheep for many years and so been supplied with manure and the weeds have been prevented from seeding. Many in the area are using a wheat-sheep rotation scheme.

Burra Mine. Work proceeds with vigour under Mr Challoner and machinery superintended by Mr Swansborough. It is expected preparations will soon be made to treat the creek sands with machinery due soon from England. The company has begun to sell ore again.

4 July 1871, page 5

W. Swansborough writes to say he is not merely superintending the machinery at the Burra Mine, but is the Manager of the Mines ‘responsible for the whole of the work’.

Court Cases, 26 July

Five men were fined for having unregistered dogs and three of them went to gaol for 14 days because they were unable to pay the fine.

Charles Blight was fined £3-10-0 for allowing young bulls to trespass among his neighbours’ stock.

John Cundy paid £4 in fine and costs (or 4 month in gaol) for smashing furniture in the bar at the White Hart Hotel, resisting police and committing a nuisance in the police cell. That he was drunk was regarded as no excuse.

28 July 1871, page 6

A Ploughing Match will be held soon at Burra. Four years ago ploughing was seldom thought of here; now large numbers of implements are sold and land in all directions is being broken up for agriculture.

Accident. A young child of Mr James Tiver broke a leg yesterday in falling from a swing.

9 August 1871, page 5

A New Road Bill proposes to create eight new Local Road Boards in place of the present arrangements. Burra would come under the North Midland District.

Obituary. Rev. D.J.H. Ibbetson aged 48 has died after being ill for some time. About eight or nine months ago a change of place was recommended and he took a voyage to New Zealand for two or three months. He returned apparently much improved, but the illness unfortunately returned and took a serious form about ten weeks ago. From then he has been confined to bed and in extreme pain from ulceration of the bowels. He was conscious to the end, which occurred at 10 p.m. on Thursday 10 August. Society has lost a good citizen and a man of considerable scientific attainment. Religion has lost a faithful and earnest teacher.

We believe he was born at Corfu in the Mediterranean and after schooling attended the College of Civil Engineers at Putney near London, completing his studies at King’s College. About 1850 he was employed as a civil engineer on the metropolitan railway works in London, where he managed several heavy contracts. His then partner is now the Metropolitan Engineer. He then decided to devote his life to the ministry and soon afterwards set sail for SA, arriving some 17 or 18 years ago. He was first stationed at Burra where his evangelical preaching and earnest piety secured a large following. In 1862 or 1863 he succeeded Rev. A.R. Russell at St John’s, where he remained until his death. After some years he also took the oversight of St Bartholomew’s Norwood, which was erected mainly through his exertions. He was one of the very few Episcopalian ministers who practically exhibit any sympathy in the work of other denominations. He was a member of the Evangelical Alliance. He favoured simplicity in worship over Ritualism. He has also taken on the education of a limited number of pupils for some years and given lectures on scientific subjects. We believe he leaves a widow and four children; two daughters and two sons. One of the latter has distinguished himself at an English University and is now in the service of the East India Company.

[Denzil John Holt Ibbetson died 10 August 1871 Adelaide aged 47. SA Deaths CD gives Denzel as the first name, but the four children registered in SA record Denzil as their father’s first name.

There may have been children born in England, but the four recorded as born in SA to D.J.H. Ibbetson &amp; Clarissa Elizabeth Ibbetson, nee Guilding were:

Arthur Browne born 11 February 1859 Redruth Glebe: died 25 August 1859 Redruth Glebe.

Obituary. [The obituary of D.J. H. Ibbetson is reprinted using substantially the same text but with the following corrections and additions.]

Mr Ibbetson was born at Beckenham near Bromley in Kent. After education at Putney College he was employed for some years by Mr J. Fowler and had a considerable length of the Manchester-Sheffield line, then in the course of construction, under his charge. Mr Fowler greatly valued his zeal as resident engineer, but Me Ibbetson was never his partner. Disagreement arose in connection with the fracture of a girder bridge, which Mr Ibbetson had condemned in the foundry, but which had been passed by another engineer, and also over Mr Ibbetson’s refusal to attend to business on a Sunday. This hindered his advance in the engineering profession and he was encouraged by an old friend, Dr Jelf, to join the Anglican ministry. He was introduced to the Bishop of Adelaide, then in England, and after a course of study at King’s College was ordained by the Bishop of London at St Paul’s Cathedral. He arrived in SA about 18 years ago. The funeral will take place this afternoon at West Adelaide Cemetery.

18 August 1871, page 7

Obituary. The news of Rev. Ibbetson’s death was received in Burra with deep sorrow. He was loved and respected here due to his earnest piety and Christian zeal combined with liberal views towards other denominations.

Agriculture. Rains continue to promise a bountiful harvest. Kooringa is fast becoming more dependent on agriculture instead of only on mining and sheep farming. This is seen in the number of implements now exposed for sale as well as the number of farmers’ carts travelling in and out of the town. The sheep stations are preparing for shearing.

Obituary. Mary Kervan, late cook at the Aberdeen Hotel, died suddenly on Saturday night. No inquest was deemed necessary as she had been attended to recently by Dr Dashwood for disease of the heart, which he certified as the cause of death. [Died 12 August 1871 aged 39 at Swansea Vale (Burra), residence Aberdeen.]

22 August 1871, page 5

The Ploughing Match to be held today is expected to attract a large attendance. Arrangements have been made for excursion fares on the railway and for a liberal prize list to ensure competition.

24 August 1871, page 4

SA Census of 2 April 1871

The population of SA was 188,995; representing an increase of 25,543 on 1861.

The Aborigines (in the settled areas) numbered 3,369 leaving 185,626 non-Aborigines.

For the County of Burra:

For the Electoral District of Burra

In the settled areas Aborigines are declining rapidly in number:

In 1861 there were 5,046 and in 1871 the number was 3,369.

24 August 1871, page 7

Burra Ploughing Match is reported at great length.

Preparations for the match on 22 August were made quickly. Plenty of prize money was subscribed, a committee was formed and advertising was carried out. Excursion fares on the railway were arranged. Despite this the number of competitors in each section was low. For five prizes there were only nine entrants. In stock there were also few entries: only three, with no bullocks or cows worthy of mention and no mares.

There were no entries from boys for ploughing or digging. Nevertheless, attendance at the event was large. The shops closed at noon and large crowds travelled north to one of the Mining Company’s sections north of the Bon Accord and about two miles from Kooringa. Every sort of vehicle was pressed into service and other rode or walked.

Mr Bull of the Aberdeen Hotel erected a spacious booth for refreshments and he also arranged a pigeon [shooting] match, climbing a greasy pole and other amusements. Schraeder’s Band was engaged, though many thought the addition of a loud kettle-drum drowned the music. W.H. Challoner was President and H. Dawson Chairman of the committee. Others on the committee were T. Bath, W. Builder, J. Drew, W.H. Williams &amp; A. Motley. Judges were J.D. Cave, W. Hudson &amp; R. Stevens.

Champions’ Prize of £6 to W. Morgan.

Men’s Class Prize of a Mellor’s single plough worth £7 to W. Barber.

Digging one rod: 1st prize of £1-10-0 to Cain

Entire draught horse: 1st prize of £2-2-0 to Mr Dawson’s horse ‘Rifleman’.

Cattle. None wore worth a prize.

Best Horse Team finishing its work in time: £2 prize to W. Ward.

A dinner was held at the Burra Hotel in the evening.

[The judges’ comments and the toasts at the dinner are reported at length.]

Among the comments at the dinner:

Mr Rosman said the coming of the railway to Burra had made a great difference. Until it arrived Kooringa had been inaccessible. He was now glad to see Kooringa establishing itself as the centre of an agricultural district. It had hitherto been said corn [wheat] could not be grown in the north and it was useless to try it at Kooringa. Why, twenty years ago people had said what was the use of putting wheat into the Gawler Plains?

Mr Cave said losses frequently arose because farmers were too niggardly, refusing to pay the labouring man 3 or 4 shillings a day more wages and this in the hope they would be able to gather the corn in all right in time. Another complaint against the agriculturalist was they did not winnow sufficiently. Burra farmers should grow an acre or two of holcus or lucerne. Likewise he could not see why a man should not improve his farm by planting a few trees around the homestead. He had become interested in the imported grasses cultivated at the Botanic Garden – particularly one called ‘Buffalo’.

Robert Gill, a farmer, said labour of the right sort was not available when wanted. ‘There might be plenty of men used to follow a flock of sheep with a dog to help them, but they complained that farmers’ hours were too long and the work too hard, and they would not do such labour for any money.’

Mr Young jocosely remarked that someone had said there were no ruins to be seen in the colony, but that person had only to come to Kooringa to discover his mistake. Certainly the state of Kooringa was not a progressive one, but whether that was to be referred to the conduct of the landlords, the least said the better. He had been there twenty years and seen many ups and downs. The first supporters of the place were the miners – very good ones; the next help was the sheep farmers, who were excellent also and now they had the agriculturalists coming around them and he thought they would be more certain customers than the other classes. Last season they had a good harvest and they had behaved well and spent money freely.

5 October 1871, page 5

Ulooloo Gold-field. The diggings are looking very well and although there were fewer men than before there is more gold being got.

6 October 1871, page 5

Burra Mine. The mine stamps are again working and the reintroduction of the old apparatus is highly approved by the miners.

6 October 1871, page 7

Ironmine Primitive Methodist Chapel saw its opening sermons preached by Rev. H.J. Pope, the circuit minister, on Sunday 1 October. On Monday a public tea was well patronised. Mr T. Hutchins presided and Mr Pope spoke of the lessons of the late war [presumably meaning the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71].

‘There were as characteristic of Germany, he believed, universality and unity of effort, great promptitude, large expenditure, and much prayer was offered for victory. This, he held, was the way the church should carry on her warfare.’

The Redruth Choir sang well chosen hymns. The new chapel was built by J. &amp; T. Pearce of Kooringa for a total cost of c. £140 and the proceeds of the services were c. £40.

16 October 1871, page 6

SA Election at Burra was orderly and about a quarter of the enrolled electors voted.

The Christy Minstrels gave an entertainment at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday to a crowded house. It was an excellent performance and the £15 taken will go to paying for scenery, clothes, etc.

Agriculture. The wheat crops look promising, but yields are threatened by want of rain.

17 October 1871, page 5

Burra Mine

The half-yearly report has been released prior to the meeting later this month. Though the new works are not completed, the raising of ore has recommenced and 257 tons of the 352 raised since last March have been sold, with 95 tons on hand. In six months 36,762 tons of stuff have been tipped; up 20,000 tons on the last half year. The railway has been carried into the mine to Stock’s Shaft and Graham’s Workings. The recently erected dressing apparatus turns out five classes of ore. Machinery for processing the orey sand accumulated in the Burra Creek has arrived. Tenants are renewing leases. Revenue from ore in the half year was £1,838 plus £857 from rents and interest. Expenditure was £13,911.

Bushranger Arrested

On Monday [sic] 13 October Lance-Corporal Smith arrested John Baker the notorious character with a previous sentence for horse-stealing. There is a warrant out against him for stealing horses from Mt Murchison in NSW. He was armed when arrested and offered strong resistance. [The 13 October was a Friday.]

20 October 1871, page 5

Agriculture. This season [in the northern area] more land has been placed under cultivation and so total production may increase, but the average yield will doubtless be less due to the drier conditions. No rust has yet been reported. Pleuro-pneumonia has not spread to a serious extent.

Bushranger Captured

John Baker, who was arrested last Friday at Kooringa, seems to have been devoid of the bushranger’s usual prudence. In May 1869 a warrant was issued at Wilcannia in the Darling District of NSW charging him and William Bertram with horse-stealing from Mount Murchison Station. There is also a charge of robbery of a hawker in the Barrier Ranges. Bertram has since been hanged for murder and robbery. Baker has eluded capture despite a £50 reward. He spent his younger days at Burra and was employed at the Cross-roads grounds about seven years ago as assistant rider. Later he broke colts for Messrs Macdonald &amp; Hosking, the present mail coach proprietors of the Northern Line. It is surprising that being known in the district he should go to Kooringa, enter a barber’s shop to have his hair cut and ask to have it dyed and then express impatience at the time the operator took to cut his hair after refusing to dye it. He then walked with two other men to Redruth and sat down outside the Court House door and began cutting up tobacco. The Court was sitting and the place was full of people. The police had received news he was en route for Burra and were taking measures to secure him. Lance-Corporal Smith who had previously often seen the prisoner in Burra was astonished to see him outside the Court House. He and Police Constable Noble at once arrested him. After walking a few steps and on being told the charge he bounded into the air with great agility and had not the police been very quick, would have escaped. It was only after a violent struggle that they managed to get him into a cell. With his very small hands he managed to slip the handcuffs. There was a revolver in his swag, but no arms were found on his person. He asserted that his reason for visiting Burra was to sell some horses he had brought with him. He is a smallish man and of a wiry build.

24 October 1871, page 5

Ulooloo Gold-field. Prospects seem to be improving. Though returns are not large, regular parcels of gold are despatched by the storekeeper there. Four or five parties of men are at work – in all about 20 diggers.

Our Burra Correspondent reported on 23 October that only about 10 diggers now remain as men have left for the shearing season. In the last five months Hinge and Nichles have averaged 30/- a week each and last week Nichles made £10. Mr Noltenius gained 11⁄2 oz in ten days. The main problem is that the washdirt has to be carted about two miles.

25 October 1871, page 5

English &amp; Australian Copper Co.

An extraordinary half-yearly meeting was held in the London Tavern. Conditions of the company were said to be improving, they having got over the small quantity of ore due to the closure of the Burra Mine and the very low copper prices. Since July they had received ore at the rate of nearly 8,000 tons p.a. independent of the Burra supply. Mr Routh hoped to be able to announce a dividend of 1/6 or 2/- at the end of the year. They had sold 400 oxen and horses on completion of the railway to the port and had laid out a further £16,000 on their Port Adelaide wharf, making £35,000 in all spent on it. It is expected to produce an income of £3,000 to £4,000 p.a.

30 October 1871, page 5

Bushranger Baker is still confined in the Redruth Gaol, but rebels much against it. Also there is a man called Dolson who is also charged with horse-stealing. The latter feigned illness, doubtless to be placed near and to have an interview with Baker. One evening, suspecting something was wrong the gaoler, Mr Perry, listened outside the cell where the two men were kept. He overheard them discussing an escape plan. They aimed to break the form of the mess table and use it to force a hole in the lath and plaster ceiling. Entering the ceiling space they would then remove a sheet of roofing iron and so gain access to the wall and drop down outside. Soon afterwards Perry found they had wrested the form from its mortice and replaced it after wetting the wood to make it swell and so appear to be firmly fixed. The next day he placed the two in irons. On Monday at locking-up time Dolson was found to have concealed a strong hammer in his boot. Baker has asserted his intention to escape and will certainly try to do so on his overland journey to NSW. He is charged with stealing four horses from Mount Murchison, sticking up under arms at Cobham’s Station 200 miles beyond Wilcannia and stealing a revolver, gun and four or five horses. A man named Edwards and Mr Curtis of the Pig and Whistle Inn at Kooringa were there at the time. Bertram, who has since been hanged was with him and was the foremost. Baker merely kept guard. The horses on which he came down to Burra were stolen from O’Leary [Olary] in the Northeast – the owner living at Pallammicca. On his way down from the Barrier he has two revolvers conspicuously in his belt and had £3 given him by a hawker and others, seeing his threatening appearance, are also said to have given him money. He is well known in various parts of the colony, especially on the Murray and about the Tiers near Gumeracha. On the way to Kooringa he proposed to a person well known in Kooringa to join him in bushranging and they would soon make £200 to £300 each. The man prudently refused the offer.

7 November 1871, page 5

New Wesleyan Chapel at Mt Bryan Flat was opened on Sunday 29 October. Rev. S. Worth, formerly of the Kooringa circuit preached three sermons. On Monday W.R. Ridgway presided at a public meeting after a tea. The Kooringa Wesleyan Choir attended. The congregations would not fit into the 20 ft x 30 ft x 14 ft high building, which cost £220. A day school will soon be opened in the building.

8 November 1871, page 4

Obituary/Inquest. On 6 November Mr Challoner JP held an inquiry into the death of Joseph Thomas whose body had been found near the Railway Store at Aberdeen that morning. On Sunday the deceased had borrowed a colt from Mr Dünneman of Copperhouse and went to Kooringa at 9 o’clock. He told Mr Ullman that the animal was wild and given to buck jumping. He spent half an hour at the Court House Hotel, kept by Mr Martin Davey. He left none the worse for three nobblers consumed while there. He told Mr Davey that though the horse had thrown a person twice, he would offer the owner £5 for it in the morning. He rode quietly away. The body was found next morning, face down with a pool of blood near the nose. The deceased was taken to the Aberdeen Hotel where a medical examination concluded death was due to a fall from a horse. The verdict was death by accident. The deceased was to have been married in a fortnight and supported his widowed mother.

[Joseph Thomas died 6 November 1871 Aberdeen, residence Copperhouse, aged 28.]

16 November 1871, page 5

Farrell’s Flat is growing. There have been additions to Mr J.H. Bleechmore’s hotel. Large quantities of wool are arriving at the station daily and the coming wheat harvest will sustain activity there. Several new buildings have been erected in the last few weeks.

17 November 1871, page 3

[Kooringa] Masonic Lodge. A Masonic Ball was held at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday evening. Guests came from Clare and Adelaide and other places and a band from Adelaide was obtained. The room was decorated with evergreens, paperhangings, flags etc. Dancing continued to dawn. Nearly 100 people attended.

The Prince of Wales’s Birthday Holiday

The picnic arranged by Rev. Stanton at Princess Royal was marred by the almost continuous rain, but went ahead and was enjoyed by the small number who went. The number of rabbits there is surprising and even without dogs the agile youngsters caught a few.

About 30 young people attended a dance in the evening at the Grammar School, which continued till early morning.

The Redruth Sunday School held its Anniversary services. Proceeds were about £14.

The Redruth Primitive Methodist Chapel has undergone extensive and necessary repairs and was reopened on Sunday. Rev. J.G. Wright preached three sermons. On Monday with the rain falling heavily and the creeks rising, nearly 40 people had an excellent repast in Mr Steven’s wine and spirit store. The next day a similar treat was given in a tent near E. Stevens’s hay shed, where many enjoyed themselves. Proceeds were £52.

The Branch Bible Society held a meeting in the Bible Christian Chapel recently. Attendance was small and Rev. B. Backhouse was the deputation. Collections for the year totalled about £60 and [book] repository sales had been £12-4-6. £40 was awarded as a donation to the Parent Society. Mr Porter was elected Chairman and P.W. Dyer as Secretary for the year.

17 November 1871, page 4

Weather. Good rains have refreshed crops. Last Monday about 150 points fell in 24 hours. This has boosted grain prospects and so far there have been no reports of red rust in wheat or of pleuro-pneumonia in cattle. The wool clip has been one of the best and the benefit of the railway has been much appreciated.

20 November 1871, page 3

Davieston [modern Hanson]. There are efforts to get a hotel and a chapel here. A school is also needed as there are at least a dozen residents with large families.

Farrell’s Flat now has at about 18 shops and dwellings.

21 November 1871, page 3

An Invitation Ball has been held at the Burra Hotel by the quadrille class. About 90 guests attended and enjoyed themselves till dawn. Trees with artificial flowers decorated the room, with Chinese lanterns and garlands suspended from them. R. Tyrie was MC and Mr Geddes the Secretary.

24 November 1871, page 3

John Baker. Adelaide Police Court 21 November. Baker was charged with having stolen, at Mt Murchison in NSW 14 October 1869, in conjunction with William Bertram, three geldings and one saddle, the property of Alfred Kirkpatrick and E.S. Bonney. The prisoner was remanded into the custody of Constable Murphy to be taken to Wilcannia to answer the charge.

7 December 1871, page 5

John Baker. Constable Murphy arrived in Wilcannia 29 November with the prisoner John Baker. When the irons were being put on the prisoner in Adelaide, he attempted to strike the constable, but was subdued. They went by rail and then coach to Wilcannia via Wentworth. Baker had previously stated his intention to escape and but for the vigilance of Constable Murphy would certainly have done so. Baker was placed before the bench on 30 November and remanded for eight days.

8 December 1871, page 4

Agriculture. The weather has been so variable that farmers are now revising their hopes of a good season. Some rust has appeared, but it is too late in the season to do much harm. Of more worry is the appearance of grasshoppers. On the Murray Plains great damage has been done and is still continuing. Some farmers have lost at least half their crop and one paddock of 250 acres is not considered worth reaping. Birds are usefully eating them and this should be a lesson to those who shoot all birds for sport.

8 December 1871, page 5

Mr W. Challoner was given a complimentary dinner by a few old friends at the Burra Hotel on Friday night. He has recently retired from the management of the Burra Mines. Upwards of 250 persons signed the address that was presented to him. Dr Dashwood JP presided, supported by Mr T.S. Porter, with Captain Killicoat in the vice-chair. Mr Challoner left Burra on Tuesday morning en route for Europe.

Light Bridge Hotel at Linwood. There is a lengthy report of the inquest on the destruction by fire of this hotel in the early hours of 3 December.

Ulooloo Diggings. A 12 oz nugget was found on Friday, a two ounce one on Saturday and a three-quarter once specimen recently.

13 December 1871, page 5

Grasshopper Plague. A report from the Black Springs area says grasshoppers have been bad there for some weeks and thick clusters of half an acres have been common. Last Friday and Saturday the army of pests was so dense that everything green was eaten and trees have also been stripped of bark and branches as thick as a man’s little finger. It was impossible to keep them out of the houses. They got into the milk and the cupboards and ate innumerable holes in the muslin curtains.

Ulooloo Diggings. Mr Simmons the storekeeper has taken three fine specimens of gold to Burra. The largest was a little more than 13 oz troy. It was found about two miles from Ulooloo Creek and one and a half miles from the head of Coglin’s Gully by a German digger washing material there. It is nearly all pure gold. The second specimen of about 2 oz of gold is more mixed with ironstone. A 3⁄4 oz nugget is almost pure gold, but very rough. It is as well to record that not much gold is being found generally by other workers.

Weather &amp; Grasshoppers. A report from the Manoora area says rust has appeared and the wet weather has been injurious to haystacks. Grasshoppers have also appeared today and yesterday in a stream heading to the south. They are like a fall of snow. Not much damage has been done so far. Reaping is due to start in about ten days.

15 December 1871, page 3

Burra Amateur Christies gave an entertainment at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room for the benefit of the Burra Race Fund. It was very well received.

Grasshoppers continue to hover in the district. Some crops that promised to be splendid have been ruined. Red rust had not been bad here, though some areas, such as Clare, have been more affected.

English &amp; Australian Copper Co. Mr Ebenezer Cooke has been formally appointed to manage the company and he entertained the employees at a social on Saturday night at T. Yeo’s Hotel at Port Adelaide. 60-70 of the smelters and other workers attended. A toast was drunk in silence to the memory of the late manager Mr J. Hamilton and then one to the new manager. Other toasts followed.

[Was the late manager James Hamilton, who died at Woodville 30 July 1871 aged 58?]

Ulooloo Diggings. Mr William Armstrong of Hindmarsh and formerly a Victorian digger, reports that after spending some time at Ulooloo he considers it the best poor man’s diggings in the colony. He and a mate obtained £3 worth of gold in a week. He thinks it worthwhile on this showing to return and develop the claim. There are 35-40 men on the field and he says they are at least covering expenses and several are making wages. The cost of living there is moderate, but diggers need to go with some money in their pocket. Moderate return can be expected and there is the possibility of good returns.

The Trial of John Barker at Wilcannia 18 December

John Barker was charged with robbery under arms and appeared before a crowded court.

George Urquhart, manager of Mt Arrowsmith Station at Mt Gibbs said that the prisoner and William Bertram had stuck him and the station up on 23 October 1869. Bertram had taken the witnesses revolver and bailed him up. The pair had come to the station in the afternoon. The prisoner had been armed. Bertram had asked him if he would sell him rations. When he refused Bertram had said he would take them. They were occupied half an hour in the store. Bertram followed him into the hut and Baker followed. Baker took a double-barrelled gun and said he would return it. They got meat from the kitchen and then took a grey mare, a grey cob and a black horse. He estimated the value of the revolver at £5, the gun at about £10 and the horses at £35. The horses were the property of McCulloch, Sellers &amp; Co.

Peter Devine, labourer of Mt Gibbs, said he was horse driving about shearing time 1869 and saw Baker and Bertram in the yard. Baker had a revolver and double-barrelled gun and ordered him off his horse.

Baker was committed to the Quarter Sessions at Bourke.

Baker was then charged by the police with stealing three horses valued at £35 from Mt Murchison Station, the property of A. Kirkpatrick &amp; R.B. Smith.

Alfred Kirkpatrick deposed that on the night of 14 October 1869 he had left three horses in the station yard. [He then described them and their brands.] When he returned about midnight they were not there. He did not immediately suspect they had been stolen. In the morning he found the rails down and an old saddle and a bridle were also missing. Bertram who was in charge of a hawker’s wagon had not been seen that morning. The cook said Bertram and Baker had been together in the evening and had left together. Several boxes and drawers in the wagon had been forced open and their contents strewn about. A blackfellow had helped track his horses in the direction of Wilcannia. Two of the horses were his and the other belonged to E.S. Bonney, then station manager. He informed the police and with the aid of a blackfellow tracked the horses to within half a mile of Wilcannia.

About a week later started with police in pursuit and went to Cobham Lake, Mt Murchison Station. Found the horses there and a fourth he had not missed before – a bay mare, the property of a Chinaman employed on the station. Mr Urquhart, the manager at Mt Arrowsmith told him Baker and Bertram had stuck up the station and left the horses there. He heard that Bertram and Baker had sold his horses to Maori Jack and that Baker had said that the grey was a great little horse and he was sorry not to be taking him on. Next morning the horses were gone. He could not find them and returned with the station horse and the fourth horse to Wilcannia. Maori Jack brought the horses back saying he heard they had been stolen. He gave them to the police and showed a receipt of Bertram’s for the sale. He said he had bought them from the prisoner and Bertram.

Baker cross examined the witness.

James Willoughby the cook at Momba said Bertram had been engaged by the Hawker O’Brien to take charge of his wagon and also to carry water and kill sheep by Willoughby. The day before he went missing he had been with Baker and had failed to deliver the water. The next day he found him at about 10 or 11 p.m. at the hawker’s wagon, along with Baker. The next morning when the horses were missed Mr Kirkpatrick asked if anyone was with Bertram the previous night and Willoughby told him Baker was with him. Willoughby also said things in the dray were all topsy-turvy.

Peter Devine gave evidence as a witness to the sale of the horses by Bertram to Maori Jack. Under cross examination he could not say that he knew if Baker had any connection with the sale.

The Bench dismissed the charge of horse stealing, there being insufficient evidence.

Baker then lodged a complaint of ill treatment. The Bench undertook to look into the affair [but sounded distinctly doubtful and seemed inclined to consider Baker’s resistance to the law was the reason for any hard handling.]

Ulooloo Diggings. Mr T. Scott of Stanley Flat has shown the Northern Argus gold he has won from Ulooloo. He says colour can be found all over the creek, and believes it will turn out a good poor man’s diggings.

John Baker the bushranger. Constable Murphy has returned to Wilcannia from Bourke, where he delivered John Baker to the prison authorities. He reports that when he arrived at Dashan’s &amp; Mungovern’s Tankarooka Station 75 miles up the river, at midnight, the prisoner was placed in a room, leg-ironed and chained with a dog-chain to a sofa. About 3 a.m. he asked to go to the back of the house. Afterwards he was again chained to a bench outside. Suddenly he made a desperate effort and broke the handcuffs. He struck the trooper twice on the temple. Murphy got hold of him by the throat and Baker kicked him in the stomach and made every effort to get hold of the constable’s revolver. Murphy was aided by Captain Parker of the Kennedy, who happened to be there. He strapped the prisoner’s hands behind his back. Baker still persisted and head butted the policeman in the stomach. The prisoner was then placed in the mail van and part way to Bourke his hands were released after his entreaties. They reached Bourke between 3 and 4 p.m. on Sunday. Constable Murphy is to be praised for his pluck, skill and endurance in overcoming the obstacles and hardships of such a mission.

Accident/Obituary. Mr Fred Gurney had driven the mail conveyance from Gawler to Kooringa and later from Kapunda to Kooringa and sometimes from Kooringa to the North-East without injury whilst travelling on dark wet nights, crossing dangerous creeks, going over steep sidlings, often with half-broken horses, on one of the colony’s worst winter tracks, but he was killed instantly on a piece of good road in broad daylight. He was driving a coach and four from the Burra Races with a vehicle laden with passengers and when nearly opposite Mr Bath’s store the vehicle gave a slight swerve at a small gutter and he was thrown off his seat. He fell on his head, broke his neck and with a few gasps was no more. He leaves a widow and large family. He must have been driving to and from Burra for the last 18 years. Dr Dashwood JP held the inquest.

[Frederick Gurney died 1 January 1872 Kooringa, residence Kooringa, aged 54. Records show there were six children, two girls and four boys born between 1852 and 1868. One, a boy born in 1865, had died aged 1 month.]

6 January 1872, page 6

Accident/Obituary. Frederick Gurney was driving a coach into Kooringa from the racecourse when he fell and was killed. He was the oldest mail-driver in the colony. He came to the colony with the 96th Regiment, in which he was a corporal, in about 1840. On his discharge from the army he took to mail-driving, and served under nearly all the different contractors on the northern roads for over 20 years.

Ulooloo Diggings. A Wesleyan Chapel was opened at Ulooloo on Sunday 31 December 1871 when Rev. Leggoe from Fiji preached twice to large congregations. A public meeting the next day drew a large gathering and raised £36. This, with previous subscriptions brings the total raised to £127. The chapel with furnishings has cost about £239 exclusive of the harmonium, which is the result of the efforts of the Misses Hiles.

12 January 1872, page 6

Agriculture. The Kooringa district has seen 4,000 acres more under crop this season. The yield was 6 bushels per acre and would have been about 15, but for the grasshoppers that destroyed about 9 bushels per acre in the Hundreds of Kooringa, Kingston, Ayers, Reynolds, Anne, Whyte, Andrews, Bundaleer and Apoinga.

13 January 1872, page 5

W.H. Opie, the mail driver on the Kadina Road, was given a testimonial at the Freemason’s Tavern in Adelaide in acknowledgement of his past services. He had first driven to the Peninsula ten years ago when travel there was very difficult. Horses were often knocked up and vehicles smashed. Mr Opie had never been seen to get out of temper with man or beast. He was presented with a silver tea and coffee service of seven pieces and a purse of money. Mr Opie returned thanks. Toasts songs and recitations followed.

17 January 1872, page 5

Floods. Heavy rain from violent thunderstorms has produced extensive flooding in the north of the colony. Reports from Kooringa say the weather has been fearful to the north and the Burra Creek was running higher than it is remembered to have done. It was still rising rapidly and houses in Aberdeen had been flooded.

19 January, 1872, page 5

Floods. On Tuesday afternoon the Burra Creek was higher than in living memory. It was a roaring turbid current from bank to bank. At Aberdeen the water was three to four feet deep through the White Hart Hotel and flooded several other cottages. It was unable to escape beneath the Redruth Bridge and spilled out around the macadamised roads past Mr Tiver’s and Mr Ridgway’s stores and flooded Mr Coull’s Aberdeen Hotel. In Kooringa there were only trifling losses, but the Company’s Bridge is greatly injured.

26 January 1872, page 5

Obituary/Inquest. On Monday at the White Hart Inn Dr Dashwood held an inquest on the body of an infant who had died that morning. The inquest followed reports that the child had been starved and Dr Walls of Aberdeen entertained the opinion that death was due to want of proper nutrition. The deceased was the illegitimate child of a married woman named Day, now away from Burra, who had engaged Mrs Foreman of Aberdeen as a wet nurse to look after it when it was a month old. Mrs Foreman said it weakened although fed on arrowroot, maizena and occasionally suckled. A few days before its death it was taken by Mrs Foy and seems to have existed on an occasional drink from any nursing mother who lived nearby. Dr Walls said it had died from atrophy and he had seen children die from this cause even when given every attention and nourishment. The verdict was death from natural causes, but the jury censured the mother for want of humanity in deserting her child.

[Theresa Day was born 28 October 1871 Lindsay Creek, River Murray to Jacob Day and Catherine Ryan, and died 22 January 1872 at Redruth.]

Ulooloo Diggings. Affairs here are progressing. On Wednesday last some 150 persons were here and about 60 more have now joined them. Some men are making good wages. Payable ground has been found for two miles. The Northern Argus reports that many men have caught the gold fever since the discovery of the 12 oz nugget in December. By Tuesday morning some 250 were on the field. They are sinking depths of from 18 inches to 5 ft through alluvial drift on a bottom of perpendicular slate. The main workings are on tributaries of Ulooloo Creek. Average earnings appear to be between 5/- and 6/- per day. Several reef claims have been taken up, but only one has been developed yet. Their shaft is down 14-15 ft. The recent floods damaged the workings. We would not advise anyone in regular work to throw it in and go gold seeking here, but the unemployed would do no harm in giving the place a good trial.

29 January 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. W.F. Coglin the Crown Lands Ranger reports about 200 people on the field. Trooper Smith, who has just returned from Ulooloo, was informed by several persons that their average earnings for some time had been £4 a week. A few Victorian diggers have recently arrived there.

30 January 1872, page 4

Education. An editorial gives support to the Education Board in its attempts to get the Government to fund a model school in Adelaide. The Government keeps on giving in principle support, but fails to deliver the money needed. A site was purchased in the remote past, but the £2,000 needed to erect the school has not been forthcoming.

30 January 1872, page 5

Board of Education. At the meeting of the Board on 29 January Mr Hartley moved that it was desirable that a public elementary school be erected on the site already secured by the Board. Though there were free schools in the city, their continuance was not guaranteed and depended on money being raised by people and a lady who collected for them had said she had great difficulty in collecting funds. The funding of one large school would be much more efficient than spreading it among five schools. He said it was clear that the worst prepared scholars came from the very small schools. The site secured was at the corner of Grote and Brown Streets. [Brown Street is now called Morphett Street.] It could serve the whole of the west side of the city. Two schools in Morphett Street, two in Gilbert Street and one in Gouger Street could then be dispensed with. Mr Hardy said the Board had pursued this idea for 15 years. He urged an amendment to the effect that the Board urge upon the Government the necessity of proving the funding for an elementary school to be erected on the site purchased. Mr Hartley agreed to the amendment. Money (£2,000) had been voted in 1867, but had never been received.

Ulooloo Diggings. Interest in the field is increasing and reports say that many men are doing well.

3 February 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports most men here are making a livelihood and some a good living.

5 February 1872, page 7

Rev. L.W. Stanton has established a day school for the education of poor children. Subscriptions are being raised to defray the expenditure. In this connection an entertainment was staged on Tuesday in the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms. [Details of the program are printed.] £5 was raised.

9 February 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. Some hundreds of men are now on the field, but the majority are lookers on. The authorities have sanctioned the sale of drink and this has led to scenes of deplorable debauchery. All who choose to work steadily are said to be earning a livelihood, but no large finds have yet been made public.

17 February 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports a population on the field of 300-400, with a good proportion at work. No large finds are reported and in fact the majority of diggers do not appear to be making good wages, perhaps because they are heavily concentrated in one creek. The gold that is recovered is of good quality, being coarse and nuggetty and we believe is fetching £3-17-6 an ounce.

22 February 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. There are reports of some good finds, with one group said to have obtained a pound weight of gold in three weeks. Some are making fair wages, but many are getting next to nothing. People are constantly arriving, but others are leaving. There are objections to the opening of a public house, but a sly grog joint was likely to have appeared all to soon if this had not been allowed and a licensed in is surely preferable. Residents are hoping police will soon be sent to the field.

24 February 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. A letter to a friend in Gawler from one at Ulooloo reports one store, one public shanty and two or three blacksmiths’ forges, though they are not doing much as yet. Not much sharpening is required as the ground is easy and few holes exceed 20 ft. Most sinking on payable gold is on the banks of the creek. The creek is almost worked out. Many parties say they are not getting enough to pay for their tucker. ‘I don’t think there are six parties getting wages on the diggings.’

26 February 1872, page 1

Advt. M. Terry, contractor for the North-East Mails, will run a four-horse conveyance to the Ulooloo diggings leaving the Burra Hotel every Monday, Wednesday and Friday after the arrival of the 12.30 train, returning from Ulooloo Tuesdays, Thursday s and Saturday s. Fares 10/- each way or 15/- return.

Commencing from Wednesday 28 February.

1 March 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. People in Kooringa seldom hear of anyone coming from the field with gold. There is no doubt some have made good wages. If the reef could be found a good industry might be established. About 200 men remain on the field, many having left, but others arrived. There is less rowdyism and a policeman was there last Sunday. The old creek is still the focus of activity, though a small rush occurred on Monday to a gully about 3⁄4 mile from the camp.

8 March 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports about 50-60 people have left the field, but most have the intention of returning. Most people there are presently not earning first class wages.

9 March 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports that two young men from near Watervale returned from the diggings with 1 oz 7 dwts of gold as the result of three weeks work. They are convinced the field is payable, but the shortage of water for washing the dirt is a problem. The deepest hole we have heard of there is about 20 ft. Three Messrs Buzzacott have returned after three weeks’ work with 4 oz of gold and are favourably impressed. The diggers complain of grog-selling, but if the miners drink to excess it is hardly fair to blame the vendor.

News from the Ulooloo diggings this week is not encouraging. There are still 100-200 persons there, but few are earning wages. Still, the steady plodders are getting enough to keep them going and being their own masters encourages them to put up with privations. They are convinced things would look up if the reef could be found and some are seeking it. New rushes a few miles distant prove the auriferous area is extensive.

13 March 1872, page 5

SAR Main North Line Trains

‘Convenience and Economy’ of Riverton complains of the inconvenient timetable on the line. The writer suggests a timetable that would give convenient two trains a day each way without accommodation costs and suggests also that they be mixed trains as on the Kapunda line, which would do away with the goods train.

16 March 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. A letter from the diggings reports some nice finds in the last few days.

23 March 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports a new find three miles from Ulooloo Creek that has caused a rush to the spot. There are about 150 diggers at work.

29 March 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. A digger named Dearlove was in Clare on Wednesday with 3 oz of gold as his share for four week’s work. He has returned to the field and has done better than anyone else from the Clare area. A number of farmers have now left the diggings to undertake ploughing and prepare for sowing. Not more than 200 remain, of whom about 60 are in Coglin’s Gully. Earnings here are from 12/- to £3-10-0 per week. Wash-dirt from here has to be carted three miles at accost of 2/- per dray load. Fortunately food is not expensive and a man who does without grog may get by on 8/- a week. Diggers have been more attentive to work in recent weeks. It is said the grogshop now barely pays, though at first it was selling 10 hogsheads a week. The diggings now have about 100 tents, 200 persons, 1 store and 1 grogshop.

2 April 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. Mr Bull of Mt Bryan reports the field has a new lead near the bend in the creek where the recent rush took place. The gold is in reddish clay and is yielding half an ounce to the load. Those who have gone up determined to give the locality a fair trial have done tolerably well, but loafers have no chance. We learn that the English, Scottish &amp; Australian Chartered bank has purchased in all about 250 oz of Ulooloo gold.

Water for washing will be plentiful in winter. There are said to be good prospects at a claim in a place half a mile from Saw Mill Gully.

5 April 1872, page 7

Easter in Burra

The Church of England Sunday School treat was held at Princess Royal. Three wagon loads of children set out on Monday morning, along with Rev. Stanton, the choristers and friends in private traps. They were hospitably received and enjoyed fruit from the orchard and vineyard and danced on the verandah. They were treated to a dinner in the large dining room, to which the accompanying adults were also invited. They enjoyed a fine cold collation. They returned to Burra by sundown.

On Tuesday evening Rev. Stanton presented an entertainment at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room, attended by about 130. £6-16-6 was raised for the Firewood Fund for the poor.

The Wesleyan Sunday School held its Anniversary over Easter. Mr Bone of Kent Town presented two sermons and Rev. Pope preached in the afternoon. On Sunday evening it is estimated one sixth of the town’s population crammed the chapel. On Monday the children were regaled with fruit at a picnic on Limestone Hill. Mr McCulloch supplied the fruit. Tea meetings followed. Proceeds totalled £30-17-6. About 200 children are on the books, but complaints of a scarcity of teachers are made.

13 April 1872, pages 4 &amp; 5

Editorial on ‘Our Goldfields’

The report of the Warden Mr Perterswald confirms that there is no evidence that SA gold mining has progressed beyond small things. Nothing more can be expected till men of means are prepared to invest in development works. [The article then goes on to give an account of various discoveries in the colony and the Northern Territory.]

13 April 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. Reports say there are now not much more than 100 persons at the diggings, but that those are earning wages. The public house is much quieter than when it was first started; the presence of police being a wholesome check.

15 April 1872, pages 4 &amp; 5

The Burra Mine. Although there is no likelihood of the SA Mining Association regaining its former importance, the last half-yearly report shows it is not yet entirely played out. There are yet in the mine thousands of tons of cupreous ore, which if not as rich as in former days is yet payable. There is still work for scores of men for years to come. The shareholders will not again be richly rewarded, but their expenditure will not be entirely unproductive. An increased yield of ore has been reported for the half-year and this, with the rise in the copper price, discloses a more cheerful prospect than for many previous half-years. On 30 September 1871 the quantity of ore on hand was 95 tons, but this has been augmented by nearly 679 tons to 774 tons. 502 tons have been sold the E &amp; A Copper Co. (which has recently resumed the payment of dividends). Despite some problems with the drawing chains, 21,797 loads or 27,246 tons have been hauled out of the main pit. There are two main cuttings from which stuff is being taken. One is 88 fathoms in length from the foot of the incline and has not yielded any large quantity of ore. The western cutting extends to a length of 77 fathoms and is proving more productive. The new dressing machine has not been without its problems. A stoppage took place in December for repairs, and it has not yet resumed duty. A few pitches have been let to tributers, but most work is being done by men directly employed by the company. The great flood down the Burra Creek on 16 January carried away so much orey sand that the erection of machinery designed to treat that stuff was suspended. Arrangements have been entered into for the removal of certain deposits of sand of good quality. The balance sheet does not reveal a particularly prosperous company, but assets more than cover liabilities. The report says ‘the prospects of the mine are more encouraging than they have been for some years,’ and ‘there is good reason to hope that the undertaking will shortly prove remunerative.’

20 April 1872, page 5

Thieves Caught. The Kapunda Herald reminds us that in December last Mr Ohleman, a traveller for Messrs Wills &amp; Co. left his vehicle at Mr Gurner’s in Riverton while he went to Adelaide. When he returned on Monday he found it had been taken down to the Gilbert and there ransacked. Three men were apprehended last week on suspicion of being the perpetrators of this offence. They are John Thomas, John Haren and Mr Owie. Haren was found to be in possession of a portion of the stolen goods. At Riverton Court on Wednesday they were committed for trial at the Supreme Court and in the meantime were sent to Redruth Gaol.

The Annual Report of the Board of Education is the subject of an article.

The number of schools has increased from 300 to 307. The growth has occurred almost entirely in the outlying Hundreds. The total number of children instructed in public schools in 1871 was 20,355. The number of children on monthly rolls was 15,791 compared with 15,108 last year. Average attendance was 12,535 compared with 11,967 in 1871. This represents an average attendance of 79.3%. There are 298 licensed teachers, of whom 126 hold the Board’s certificate of competency. 30 have certificates from other authority, 12 are probationers and 130 are non-certificated. Hope is expressed that before next year the model school will be in operation in Adelaide. ‘The general impression conveyed by the statistics is that although some progress has been made, there is no substantial ground for congratulating the colony on the present condition of public education within it.’

Mt Bryan Hotel. There is a report of a court case involving Mr J.B. Bull, landlord of this hotel and the encashment of certain cheques.

10 May 1872, page 4

Weather. The continuing dry spell in the Burra district has brought fears of an impending drought. The town is now benefiting from the reopening of the mine and the influx of miners’ custom. This and the addition of trade from farmers recently settled around the district along with considerable orders from sheep farmers to the north and east had made businessmen hopeful that the winter would pass without financial difficulties, but now the prospect of a drought is causing apprehension.

To Clare &amp; Back

[This is an exceedingly wordy and remarkably uninformative article given its length.]

The writer advises eating a hearty meal before joining the train at 7 a.m. Refreshments along the track are available, but are ‘neither numerous nor extensive’. At Gawler the traveller changes trains for the Burra line and at Roseworthy the old main line to Kapunda has become the branch line as the train continues to Burra. At Riverton a shed is still needed and a quantity of wheat was observed there in the open. At Riverton the up and down train cross and there was a stay of some 20 minutes. The writer spent this time taking a vehicle to see the sights, but found most time was spent at a building that was neither a schoolhouse not an Institute and afterwards he observed the departure of the mail coach to Clare and the north via Rhynie and Auburn. He had decided to stay on the train and take the shorter trip to Clare from Farrell’s Flat. He wonders why there is a new road from Auburn to Saddleworth when a shorter new stretch from Rhynie to Riverton would have given a good road to Clare. Farrell’s Flat appears destined to be a place of some importance. The line then sweeps to the east, making Farrell’s Flat an entrepot for a large tract of country between the main northeaster route from Burra and the northern route from Clare. The town here is called Hanson, though the station is called Farrell’s Flat and another town called Davies [now called Hanson] has been laid out at some distance. Usually two coaches from Clare meet the train at Farrell’s Flat, but on this day only one was in attendance and it could convey only four passengers and a small boy. There were eight wanting to travel and the writer was among those left behind. He engaged a trap to make the 15 mile journey, which was uninspiringly bare either from locusts or drought. The heaviness of the road limited progress to 6 m.p.h. The hill River Run is going under the plough as it is transformed into wheat farms. Sheep and shepherds alike are displaced from some 7,000 acres of pasture.

[To be continued.]

Kooringa: A Dilapidated Town.

It is pleasing to see that the SA Mining Association is beginning to repair its numerous cottages and make little additions to the roads and footpaths. The town has been in their hands for more than 20 years and the signs of the amount spent on it by the landlords, who are supposed to have drawn rent from every house until recently, are few and far between.

‘The tenants, following the example of the owners, have been equally indifferent as to appearances, and the consequence is that Kooringa has been shabby, and many of the houses, if such they can be called, are among the most squalid in the British Empire.

In walking up the main street one sees business places paintless, and with stucco off their fronts, a stable roof held on by stones to prevent the wind blowing it away, signboards become unreadable owing to the latest coat wearing off and old lettering showing through, a blacksmith’s wooden shop that certainly has not stood upright during the last ten years, unpainted verandah posts, shutters and doors, and the words “Letter-box” still visible on a house that was used as a Post-Office 22 years since. Taking all these together a stranger is surprised that the thoroughfare should be inhabited by well-to-do tradesmen. It must not be supposed that all the stores are like those noticed; there are a few exceptions, and of late a considerable improvement has taken place in a few places.’

Last week the Burra Company began covering their cottages in Market Square with iron, besides renovating the police cottage walls.

‘Should this be continued, what with Mr Banks’ new assembly-room and his house undergoing outside improvement, the square would, if the gingerbeer factory had a new face, present a decent appearance.’

[Banks was the landlord of the Miners’ Arms Hotel; now the Burra Hotel.]

‘A stroll among the houses at the back of the commercial quarter has a depressing effect. Ruins present themselves in every direction – cottages without doors and windows, the roofs often dilapidated; in the inhabited houses belonging to the Company daubed and dirty walls, and paint unknown or very ancient. There are, however, some changes to be noted even here. A substantial stone wall has been built around the Wesleyan Mission House and Chapel. St Mary’s church has also been lately thoroughly repaired inside and out; so have the Bible Christian Chapel and a few private residences of the tradespeople and those of some old inhabitants out of business. In other direction again all is desolation. The Burra Company have begun removing a few old walls, and filling up little creeks on the roadways with the ancient mortar and plaster, also making a kind of road from the paddock towards the cemetery. It is hoped that more refurbishing will go on, and that Kooringa will on entering upon a new career of prosperity be relieved from the disgrace of being styled, as it has been, the shabbiest town in the Australias.’

13 May 1872, page 6

Mt Bryan East. Some farmers are still ploughing, while others are sowing. This part of the range is chiefly new ground fallowed last winter and not breaking up as it would had the long expected rain come. Slight showers have fallen, but just enough to lay the dust.

Copper Prices. An overestimation of stocks has led to a jump in copper prices. Its scarcity has seen the price increase by £1 a day without any sign of a decrease in the buyers.

A correspondent says that stocks of copper in Chile have been overestimated by some 3,000 tons and this has been the caused of the sudden increase in prices, it having been thought Chile had stocks that could flood the market and so reduce prices. The recent low prices have seen mines there operating at a serious loss. This has seen them concentrate on higher yielding ores and a lack of investment in exploration and development. This means the mines are not in a position to immediately respond to higher prices and it will be some time before large supplies can again be reached. A continuance of high prices will be needed to induce proprietors to put the mines in full working order. In the meantime a real scarcity of the metal can be expected and high prices are not unlikely to continue.

[The article then goes into further details and explanations and includes a report from Captain Osborne, manager of the Kapunda Mine.]

14 May 1872, page 3

To Clare &amp; Back (Concluded)

[The writer spends some time outlining the site of Clare, explaining how it is hemmed in by hills and so has one long main street that is flat and then side streets ingeniously arranged in a pattern dictated by the topography.]

Clare has a population of over 1,000 souls.

[The writer then takes many centimetres of column to say that the ‘Town Hall’ is an ugly monstrosity. Before making passing references to the English, Scottish &amp; Australian Bank, a large hotel, a court house, a police station, a post office and an assortment of drapers, grocers and saddlers. He then got to the entrance to the domain of ‘the father, founder and universal friend of all and every in this his neighbourhood, and who was scarcely less well known and as much respected even in the busier scenes of Adelaide’. This convoluted style, studiously avoiding naming George Charles Hawker, is typical of the whole piece. The next section lists the local churches.]

There is a pretty little Episcopal Church, a Presbyterian Church anything but pretty, creditable Wesleyan and Roman Catholic Churches. An Institute building is nearly completed providing a library, reading rooms, lecture hall and lodge room of fair size. A school house was designed some ten years ago and begun two years ago. It awaits a sum of about £150 to clear it of debt so it can be handed over to the Corporation for use. At the southern end of the town and half way up a gully or indentation in the range there is a mansion with a glorious view and around which are orangeries and vineyards. Its owner is one of SA’s self-made sons who has made a handsome competence in pastoral pursuits and chooses not to leave the colony, but to live and spend his wealth in it.

[The writer continues for many column centimetres on his homeward journey without saying anything of interest.]

Agriculture. The rains have come and grass has clothed the pastures. There is hope for the next harvest. Farmers are busy ploughing and harrowing and sowing, while those who acted early have wheat that is springing up nicely.

Burra Mine is currently employing about 200. At the last ‘take’ some 300 tons of ore was dressed and the present ‘take’ expects to see about 400 tons. It has all been dressed by hand and the aid of stamps. Mr Darlington’s machine is still out of order.

Kooringa. The township of Kooringa is rapidly filling up and old cottages are being put in order. The Directors visited last week and have made several concessions to the tenants, which have put the latter in good heart.

On Whit Monday shops were closed at noon and many took advantage of the half-holiday to go to the cricket ground where a match was played between the married and the single, ending in a victory for the former.

On the same day the Bible Christian Sunday School celebrated its Anniversary. Mr Rock, the resident minister conducted the services. Mr William Davey has conducted the singing there for many years.

The Mount Razorback Wesleyan Chapel was opened near Mt Bryan by Rev. Stephenson on Whit Sunday.

Burra Mine. At the last meeting of the SA Mining Association Mr S. Tomkinson was elected a director in place of Mr Jaffrey, who has returned to England.

Accident/Obituary. Mr Charles Wall, a brother-in-law of Mr Chewings JP of Woorkoongoroo, and well known in Burra, fell from his dray while driving between Redruth and Hampton. He sustained severe injuries and died on Tuesday after enduring three days in great pain. He was believed to have been riding on the rail when the vehicle went over a large stone and he was thrown off, landing on his neck. He leaves a widow and a large family.

[Charles Wall died 28 May 1872 at Hampton aged 56. SA Births CD records only three sons.]

Ulooloo Diggings. Frank Parrington writes from Port Wallaroo regarding Ulooloo. A fortnight ago when he left there fewer than 100 people counting women and children remained. When the greatest rush took place there were about 200 at the ground. A little while ago the English, Scottish &amp; Australian Bank had bought 200 oz of Ulooloo gold. Since then allow for 50 oz more, which Parrington thought unlikely, this would mean about £940 worth had been won. Divide this among the hundreds who have been there over 16 months and see what wages they have won. It takes a lot of silver to find gold. Those who go were better to prospect for it than to work in a place already worked out. He says ‘I was there since Christmas, and made wages for two months out of the five, and in the other three months I did not earn salt, but was paying out of pocket for cartage.’

7 June 1872, page 5

Accident/Obituary. An inquest was held at the White Hart Hotel, Aberdeen by Mr G.W. Goodhart JP following the death of Robert Brown aged 10, the son of Mrs Jane Brown, a farmer near Ironmine. William Taylor, a brother-in-law of the deceased said he was in charge of two loaded wagons he was driving to Buttamue. He was with the front team and the boy was sitting on a cement cask in the second wagon, but was not in charge of the horses as the reins were out of his reach. At creek crossings or bad patches in the road he stopped the front wagon and guided the second one past the difficulties. At about 3.30 about three miles from Buttamue they were travelling at a fair walking pace when he looked around and saw the boy all right. A couple of minutes later he missed the boy and stopped the wagon and ran back. He found deceased five yards behind the wagon on his hands and knees trying to get up. He was badly injured with one eye and the side of his head. Taylor carried the boy about 3⁄4 mile to a shepherd’s hut, which was empty but for a dog. The boy died there and Taylor carried him back to the wagon and wrapped him in a blanket and tarpaulin. He brought him into Burra on Sunday. Taylor had no idea why the boy had overbalanced. Perhaps he had done so when trying to whip the horses and in falling was kicked or trampled by them. The wheel of the wagon had not passed over him. Taylor was greatly affected while giving evidence and the jury was most sympathetic for the trying circumstances in which he had been placed. The verdict was accidental death.

[Robert James Brown born 3 February 1862 near Templers to Robert &amp; Jane nee Ross: died near Buttamuc (sic), residence Iron Mine.]

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus says that J. Freeman of Mintaro has reported that W. Ashton has washed out 1oz 8 dwts from one load of stuff. He saw Ashton wash out 10 dwt of splendid rough gold. He reports everyone at present on the diggings seems to be doing well and there is plenty of gold in that locality. There are not more than 100 people presently at work, but more are expected as water becomes more plentiful.

The Draeger Family gave a concert at Banks’s new assembly room on 19 &amp; 20 June. Due to poor publicity the audiences were small, but the quality of the singing and instrumental performances should ensure capacity audiences if the family returns with proper notice.

Burra District Council. Moves to get this body established seem to have died again. This is a pity as local government would greatly improve the town. Goats and pigs roam at ease in the streets to the annoyance of those who have formed gardens and the roads are miserable.

The Christies gave a performance on Friday night in the Assembly Room in aid of the Institute. It passed off well.

5 July 1872, page 5

Mt Bryan East. On the eastern side of the ranges there has been splendid rain, which will greatly benefit the sown crops. The weather, which had been very boisterous, is now fine and there are prospects of a good season for the pioneers of agricultural settlement in that direction.

6 July 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports a visit to the diggings.

A mate and I travelled on good roads from Mintaro to Ulooloo Creek on Mr Braylie’s Station. We passed through the most romantic places possible called Hell’s Gates. It is a narrow pass some 40 ft wide with towering rock standing perpendicular 90 to 100 ft and quite bare of soil. This leads to a basin where the ore is washed and most of the diggers are encamped. Water has to be carted up to three miles. This hinders prospecting and those busy digging have not the means for real prospecting. It is time the Government invested some money in prospecting; there are plenty of men who would avail themselves of the opportunity. There can be no doubt that a large field exists here. Mr John Rose has started a prospecting party at his own expense. The diggings have not been carried out in a proper manner and there is no system evident. The most likely place is Black’s Creek north of the Scrubber Mine. This has not yet been prospected. The digging has been confined to Coglin’s Gully. During my stay I saw good nuggets and nice rough gold. Some parties are doing well and some are unfortunate. For those with time on their hands it is worthy of a try. Provisions are cheap. Many are now talking of leaving for shearing, but say they will return when they have some funds. Last Saturday William bray, one of the diggers, lost his left thumb while our possum shooting when his gun burst.

The road north of Burra. From the Guardian.

Thomas Bath chaired a meeting at Bull’s Mt Bryan Hotel on 8 July to discuss the condition of the road to the north and northeast from Burra. Mr Bath said that when Ryan’s fence was erected they would not be able to get over the watercourse that in that place was the so-called road. It was immediately necessary for the central Road Board to put the two or three very worst places in passable condition. Secondly the Government must place funds on the Estimates to put the whole road in good order.

Mr H. Dawson moved a resolution to address Mr Bath’s first point. [In his discussion he says that Ryan’s fencing of section 122 would make the road impassable.]

If something was not done soon the large and important traffic from the northeast would go to Booborowie and hence to Hanson Station. This would be a loss to the Government of 14 miles of haulage on the railway. Messrs Drew &amp; Co. provided some statistics of interest. There were 26 sheep stations north and east of Burra which would send their wool along the road if it were passable. They contributed 2,000 tons of wool to the Burra Railway Station and considerable traffic went north to them as well. Two stations alone had received 200 tons of goods via this road. Also 61 farmers used the road and they had 12,000 acres under crop this year. Even at 10 bushels an acre this would mean 4,000 tons of wheat would use the road. (The good season in the year before last had achieved 17 bushels per acre.) Wood cartage along the road was at least 3.500 tons. In all at least 10,500 tons of traffic used the road in a year. In the last 20 years the Government had expended the magnificent sum of £800 on it! In return they had received all the money from selling the Hundreds of Burra [sic: for Kooringa], Kingston and Hallett, in which few sections were left unsold. [The road between sections 122 &amp; 123 was critical.]

Mr Jenkins seconded the motion and said the road to Hannaford’s Corner and opposite section 75 was in a frightful state and needed attention just as much as that at Ryan’s. The proposition was carried.

Mr Cochrane proposed a petition seeking an immediate grant of £2,000 for the road. Seconded by R. Collins. Mr Masterman supported it and pointed out that not only would heavy traffic be stopped if no action was taken, but also the Royal Mail. Mr Ind then proposed a committee be formed; seconded by Mr Ryan Jnr and carried.

After the formal business of the meeting as advertised was completed Mr J.B. Bull proposed there be a petition to make Mt Bryan a polling place and this was also carried.

17 July 1872, page 3

Ulooloo Diggings. On 11 July the Warden Mr Peterswald and a well equipped party set out to prospect the vicinity of Scrubber’s Camp Mine northeast of the present diggings. At present about 60 persons are at the field, of whom 40 are diggers.

Cattle Drive. Last Week two mobs of cattle, 500 in each, passed east of Burra, bound for the Northern Territory. They were in charge of the owners Messrs Gilbert and Bagot. Both mobs will join at the Barrier Ranges before going on to Strangways Springs.

20 July 1872, page 3

The road north of Burra.

Mr John Drew chaired a meeting at Banks’ Assembly Room on 17 July to consider the state of this road.

Leading carriers, tradesmen, farmers and other interested parties attended.

Mr J.R. Stephens moved a motion calling on the Road Board for immediate action, without which the season’s traffic to the northeast would be virtually stopped. He drew attention to the fact that the difficulties of travelling on the road had always been great, but were increasing as it was being fenced. There were no parallel routes as in some other areas. The land was also being rapidly settled, increasing its use.

Mr Harry Pinch seconded the motion. Mr W.H .Williams supported it and Mr Tiver and Mr A. King also spoke for the motion. Mr Williams said copper traffic from Boolcoomata Mine could add to the use of the road.

Captain Killicoat proposed a petition for £2,500 to be expended on the road. He pointed out that Ulooloo could also generate more traffic. Mr Rosman seconded the motion. He said the low level of the Darling and Murrumbidgee this year would see traffic diverted to the road. Burra Station had more than 5,000 tons out of it during the past year and more than that coming in. He also referred to the sale of section by the Government and the rapidly expanding grain farming in the area. The sections had sold for at least £1 an acre; he thought the average more like £1-10-0. Some of this should come back to the district to maintain the road. The request was quite moderate. Mr Terry spoke in support.

Mr Lipsett then read the memorial addressed to the Road Board and the petition to be forwarded to the Members of the House of Assembly. He moved adoption of the petition. Seconded by Mr Lane and carried.

27 July 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Gawler Times correspondent reports things now very quiet in the filed. Not more than 30 persons are now present. There is a Government party prospecting in the neighbourhood.

12 August 1872, page 3

New Catholic Church. A concert in Banks’ Assembly Room raised funds for the new Catholic Church. Proceeds were about £12.

Accident. A young boy named Linkson was kicked by a horse on Saturday. His injuries were severe and his life was despaired of, but he has since improved under medical attention.

Madame Carandini and he accomplished daughters with Messrs Sherwin &amp; Gordon gave concerts at the Burra Assembly Rooms to well-filled houses. The audiences were very appreciative and demanded frequent encores.

Ulooloo Diggings. T.N. Adams, late of the Thistle Inn, writes that he went to a new rush about five miles north of Coglin’s Gully. He got 3dwt 9 gr from 20 buckets of stuff. Water is about two miles distant and this is the only stuff so far washed except for that of the prospecting party. It is a payable amount.

Ulooloo Gold. We have seen a parcel of Ulooloo gold from Mr Thomas Bath of Kooringa. It comprised 91⁄4 oz of lumpy nuggets and is one of the finest examples we have seen.

Ulooloo Diggings. Charles Simmons writes from Ulooloo. Mr Simmons disputes the report of the Burra correspondent about where action is occurring at Ulooloo. The latter says there has been sinking at Cousins’ Gully. Simmons says it was at Gainer’s Rush, about a quarter of a mile away and where gold was first discovered. Mr Mutton does indeed have tow windlasses at work, but at Gainer’s Rush, not Cousins’ Gully says Mt Simmons.

Ulooloo Diggings. The Gawler Times reports the sale of gold from Ulooloo at Gawler to the value of £18-10-0 on Friday.

The Northern Argus reports the discovery of new alluvial ground four miles northeast of Ulooloo. Mr R. Gainer washed 100 buckets of stuff for 101⁄2 dwts of gold. The material is about 21⁄2 miles from water. At present 18 people are at this new rush. So far the Government prospecting party has been unsuccessful. The number of men on the field is now very small.

20 August 1872, page

Mt Bryan School. Mr A. Hallett Jnr has visited Mr Masterman’s school, which is conducted in a chapel. There were 34 scholars with 6 evening pupils. The school was opened in April and since then the average attendance has been 26. Mr Hallett examined some of the boys who were getting on very well. He thought the school was necessary, especially as it was four miles from a township. A probationary licence was granted from 1 July.

Mt Razorback School. Mr A. Hallett Jnr visited Mr G.R. Lowe’s school, which was held in a chapel four miles east of Mt Bryan Flat. There were 34 on the roll and 20 of them had not previously been to a school. The average attendance was 20-24, with a lowest attendance of 14. Progress was good given that it had only commenced on 17 June. He thought the school necessary and Mr Lowe a suitable person for the teacher.

Notice. SA Mining Association Secretary, Henry Ayers, advises the exchange of five new shares for every original share in the Association in terms of the Supplemental Deed of Settlement.

24 August 1872, page 5

Burra Mine. Today the SA Mining Association pays its dividend of 50%, being £2-10-0 per share. As in accordance with advertisement proprietors will be able to exchange each share for five new shares, which will make the stock much more convenient as an investment. Directors Samuel Tomkinson, Henry Rymill and John Beck with Secretary the Hon. Henry Ayers left town Friday morning to visit the mine. Operations there are being pushed on with vigour. The 25 h.p. engine recently purchased is in course of erection and when this is operational it will greatly increase the hauling of both orey stuff and addle. A whim has been put up at Peacock’s Shaft and good ore already obtained. Hancock’s dressing machine should be ready for trial shortly. If successful it will have a fine field of activity in the creek alone where there is estimated to be from 50,000 to 55,000 tons of orey sand averaging 3-4% copper.

Copper Price. Telegrams from London of 1 August quote copper at £108 per ton. Mr E. Cooke of E. &amp; A. Copper Co. had a telegram citing £106 on 31 July.

Ulooloo Diggings. The new rush to Cousins’ Gully, five miles north of Coglin’s Gully has proved successful so far. Several diggers are getting 1 dwt per bucket. 18 windlasses are in operation with sinking to 20 ft. Gold has also been got in several places between Coglin’s Gully and the new rush.

26 August 1872, page 3

Local Government at Burra

A meeting has been held at Banks’ Assembly Rooms to consider the desirability of forming a District Council for Burra and its neighbourhood. Perhaps nowhere in SA are the roads outside a major town so deplorable. Before the area became settled and fenced travellers could strike out on a new track when the old became too cut up for use, but now fencing precludes this. A Council for the repair of roads is essential. About 30 persons attended the meeting, chiefly residents of the Burra townships. Captain Killicoat JP presided. Mr A. King strongly advocated the formation of a Council. He suggested an area of about 80,000 acres extending north to encompass the southern half of the Hundred of Kingston and south to the Hundred of Apoinga. J.R. Stephens proposed a Council be formed embracing the region suggested. W.R. Ridgway thought this too large an area of useless country and wanted to include the Burra townships only. Mr O. Harvey supported the proposition. J.R. Stephens thought the district should be divided into wards. Few of the roads would need to be constructed, just those of importance to trade. Mr Moody was glad to see the move and thought it desirable to nominate Councillors and Auditors. The district was divided into North, South, Redruth and Kooringa Wards with five Councillors; one each for the first three wards and two for the last. Councillors chosen were:

North Ward Mr J. Dunstan Sen.

South Ward Mr McCulloch JP

Redruth Ward Captain Killicoat JP

Kooringa Ward Mr J. Drew JP

Mr H. Dawson

Auditors Mr G.W. Goodhart JP

Mr W.H. Rosman

The roads beyond the limits of the proposed District Council are in consequence of the fences nearly impassable in places.

27 August 1872, page 3

Black Springs Ploughing Match. This was held 21 August on Mr Pascoe’s property near Black Springs. The day was cold with frequent showers. This and a lack of publicity reduced attendance, but still some visitors came from Farrell’s Flat, Steelton, Waterloo and Burra. Host Broad provided refreshments. Only two men entered the double ploughing class. One man did not finish and Trelling was judged worthy only of a second prize. In the single plough contest Ward was first, Selby second and Craig third. In the contest for boys Robinson was first and Glarson was third. At night over 50 people had dinner at the hotel where Mr Dawson presided.

28 August 1872, page 6

Henry M. Smith wrote a letter concerning Parliamentary statements about connecting the colony’s northern areas with the coast.

The extension of the northern railway from Farrell’s Flat to Jamestown will not meet the prospective requirements of many of the northern areas. It will serve the Belalie area only. Farmers of Gulnare Narridy and Booyoolie, living from 14 to 32 miles from Jamestown would not take their produce there and then pay for a 140 mile carriage to Adelaide. A better solution would be a tramway or railway from Caltowie to Pt Pirie, a distance of 53 miles. There is only one place on this route where the gradient would require a significant cutting. This line would satisfy the North Broughton and Broughton Extension farmers, Caltowie, Gulnare, Narridy, Booyoolie and Crystal Brook (as yet unalienated) areas.

[He then goes into details of distances, travelling times and farmers’ time given over to transporting their produce.]

The Hon. Member Mr Angas stated that extensive roads would be needed to cart wheat to the line. In all probability they would be district roads, not Government roads and the farmers themselves would have to maintain them through District Councils, which before long must become institutions with us.

In addition the suggestion to connect two second rate ports as Wallaroo and Port Wakefield by rail is absurd. It would parallel an existing post road at no great distance and serve but a handful of farmers in the Green’s Plains District.

Editorial on ‘The Copper Market’

Despite news in the last two mails of a slight depression in the copper price there can be little reason to fear a serious decline in the value of the metal. Authorities consider a rise likely. The demand is rising and stocks are falling and so is production. Copper is now widely employed for many new manufacturing purposes and also more extensively in some older branches of industry. The introduction of the breech-loading gun has seen its use rise dramatically. In Europe alone 15,000 to 20,000 tons annually is used in making cartridges. Railways are large users and the extension of submarine telegraph communication has increased demand. Production in England has fallen from 24,257 tons in 1856 to 6,500 tons in 1871. Production in Chile fell from 54,867 tons in 1869 to about 41,000 in 1871. Copper stocks have as a result fallen. Demand is increasing in India. [The article gives data of stocks held in various places and at various times.]

It is therefore more than probable that the maximum price has yet to be reached, despite the present small fall.

[The writer than considers past movements in copper prices before summing up on a positive, if cautious note suggesting at least the maintenance of present prices and perhaps an increase.]

30 August 1872, page 5

Local Government for Kooringa

The memorial calling for a District Council at Burra is now in course of being signed. No doubt the requisite number of signatures will be speedily obtained, perhaps by the close of this week.

Mail Coach Accident. A serious accident occurred to the mail coach between Mt Bryan Hotel and Burra on Tuesday evening. For some unknown reason it capsized and the passengers on the box seat were thrown into very dangerous positions. The driver escaped with a severe graze, but Mr John Dunston [Dunstan?] was thrown among the horses and fell on his head. He managed to escape with a nasty blow and a good shaking. Mr Ambrose Harris of Kooringa was found under the coach with his leg badly broken below the knee. He was removed to his residence where he now lies in great suffering. The inside passengers were women and children, who all escaped without serious hurt.

31 August 1872, pages 4 &amp; 5

Editorial on ‘The Occupations of the People’

In the last ten years the number of farmers has increased by 1,441 and the number of farm labourers by 3,143. Miners have risen from 1,908 to 3,338. Workers at the Burra Mines declined in the decade from 916 to 111 and at Kapunda from 287 to 119, but copper miners overall have increased from 1,264 to 2,100, mostly due to developments on Yorke Peninsula. Overall the increase in employment in mining, agriculture and stock-raising has been 2,831 in the decade or about 280 p.a. – not much to boast about. There has been a larger increase in the unproductive and middlemen classes. Those employed by general and local government have risen from 822 to 1,495. Much of this is due to the overland telegraph, but even allowing for this the increase of 30-40% cannot be justified. There has also been a large increase in the professions not in Government service. [Figures are given.]

Ministers of religion increased from 144 to 245. Those employed in commerce, trade and manufacturing have risen from 13,899 to 20,267. Manufacturing persons engaged in art and mechanical productions and in working and dealing in mineral, animal and vegetable matters show a pleasing increase.

[Further details of increases in the ‘non-productive’ classes are then given.]

7 September 1872, page 5

Half-holiday. A memorial has been presented by the assistants to the Burra tradespeople requesting a half-holiday on Wednesdays. This has been granted and is a step that might well be emulated in other parts of the colony. It releases from constant toil those whose occupation confines them indoors more than any other class. It is hoped the young folk so freed will take the opportunity to improve their health and also to pay some attention to the cultivation of their minds; a process that is much neglected.

Weekly half-holiday. The half-holiday on each Wednesday granted to their assistants upon request by the tradespeople of Burra and surrounding townships was long ago granted at Moonta. This concession has been much appreciated by both the employers and employed, especially in the hot weather.

9 September 1872, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. Gainer’s and Simmons’ rush has not yet turned out according to prospects. New ground has been opened about a miles west of Gainer’s, but the gold was not payable. A few are still working on Coglin’s Creek, all of whom are making a living. At present diggers number about 25. There are two parties prospecting besides the Government party.

14 September 1872, page 6

Port Waratah Smelting Works. There is a lengthy report on this NSW development.

Nearly all the ore smelted at these works comes from SA mines, where their richer ores are smelted by coal brought from Newcastle.

‘In order to economise fuel, and at the same time reduce the cost of carriage, The SA Copper Mining Company has opened these smelting works at Port Waratah for the purpose of smelting the inferior ores here, where coal is abundant and consequently cheap.’

The ores sent from SA largely took the place of ballast that would otherwise have had to be loaded and unloaded for the return journey when coal was sent to SA for smelting the richer ores.

[The rest of the article suggests that this arrangement applied to the Wallaroo smelting works and therefore the Yorke Peninsula mines. Burra ores are not specifically mentioned.]

Notice. Tenders are called for the building of a residence and coach-house etc near Kooringa. Drawings etc. may be seen at my residence in Dale Street up to Saturday the 28th instant and afterwards at Mr G. Gebhardt’s Kooringa. William Beattie, architect, etc. Port Adelaide, 18 September 1872.

Ulooloo Diggings. Charles Simmons again writes contesting the correspondent’s view that there are operations at Cousins’ Gully. He reiterates his contention that the place referred to is a flat known as Gainer’s Rush.

21 September 1872, page 5

Copper Prices. The great fall in copper prices was the topic on the exchange yesterday. Private telegrams confirm a price of £98 per ton. The cause appears to be the very vigorous way in which Chile has resumed her trade with England. [Further details of the price fluctuations are given.]

23 September 1872, page 6

The English &amp; Australian Copper Co. held its half-yearly meeting on 8 August; R.A. Routh presiding.

For the previous six months they had received ore, regulus, precipitate and rough copper to 2,801 tons compared with 1,983 tons for the corresponding period the year before. The Port Adelaide works smelted 2,400 tons compared with 1,889 tons. Copper made and shipped was 665 tons compared with 596 tons. The company’s wharf at Port Adelaide made £1,344-7-6 compared with £1,060-0-9. They had made a profit of £16,171-19-2. The directors declared a dividend of 2/6 per share and added 10% to the reserve fund. They added £6,546-19-2 to the credit account to make a total of £13,057-11-4 to be carried forward to be dealt with at the end of the year. They hoped to be able to pay a dividend of 5/- a share in February, or even more.

2 October 1872, page 3

Manoora district reports that there are prospects for an excellent season with good rains and the wheat progressing strongly. There is a great deal of sickness about in the form of whooping cough and some diphtheria along with many severe colds. Only a few cases have proved fatal.

Mt Bryan East. The winter brought snow and frosts a-plenty along with much wind and sufficient rain to produce promising crops, especially on the new lands. The cold had delayed growth. The roads towards Burra are in a wretched state, ‘but apparently when someone is killed the authorities will send labourers to fill the holes’.

3 October 1872, page 3

Midweek Holiday. The new arrangement for businesses at Burra to close at 1 p.m. on Wednesdays came into effect his week. This week the weather was too stormy to encourage outdoor sports, despite which a group of cricketers played for two or three hours at Redruth and some lovers of quoits followed their preferred game at Kooringa.

3 October 1872, page 5

Locusts. Grain fields near Kooringa promise a good harvest this year. Frequent rains have produced luxuriant growth. Locust hatchings from last year’s eggs are feared, but though a considerable number have been seen in sheltered spots there is as yet no real damage.

Mr W.W. Hughes has donated a large sum - £20,000 to £30,000 is mentioned – towards the establishment of the University of Adelaide. [Most of the article is devoted to pointing out how rare such philanthropy is and how most rich men stick to most of their money with the ‘tenacity of a horse leech’ and deem themselves generous if they part with a £5 note and if they subscribe £100 consider they have done something worthy of the admiration of the world at large.]

‘It will be observed that ...Captain Hughes has not waited for his riches to be snatched from his grasp by death before endeavouring to do good with them. In so doing he has acted wisely, for he will have the gratification of witnessing during his lifetime the effects of his liberality – a gratification which we trust may be prolonged to the utmost limit of his desire.’

Northern Roads

There is a report on a meeting at Clare, which echoes the concerns of those held at Mt Bryan and Burra about the state of roads to the northern areas.

9 October 19872, page 7

Stanley District

There is a report on a deputation to the Government seeking to divide the Stanley District into wards, and of a counter-memorial arguing against that step. There was also a deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works seeking money to be expended on the road from Mintaro Station to the town.

Naming of Townships and Hundreds

Mr Ward has been defeated in his attempt to the absurd practice of naming hundreds and townships after obscure individuals who would otherwise be unknown to fame. The commissioner of Crown Lands said he had nothing to do with naming such places and they were given by the Governor. He seemed to imply that the resolution would be an infringement of Crown prerogative. We can hardly believe that the Governor as a man of taste is responsible for such preposterous and disfiguring names as Jamestown, Georgetown, Laura and the Hundred of Dublin or a dozen equally objectionable.

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports that with a very few exceptions the people have all left Ulooloo for the shearing season. There are two stores and a public house and there are at present 12 diggers. The Government prospecting party has yet to find any payable gold. Shearing is in full swing at Mt Bryan Station.

The Burra Mine. The half-yearly report of the SA Mining Association has just been laid before shareholders. The accounts are as usual made up only to 31 March. There was an apparent slight loss on the year up to that date. Outgoings of £13,922-14-8 were placed against income of £13,570-18-4. These costs include those of experimenting with the new machinery and of erecting it. Doubtless due to the new processes and the price of copper the Directors were able recently to declare a dividend. The report is judiciously silent on future returns. As operations clear away surface debris it may be expected that more lucrative stuff will be reached. In the year to 31 March 1,058 tons of ore was raised and in the six months to 30 September 1,269 tons was raised. This averaged 171⁄2% copper. In a few days it is expected water will be forked to the 50 fathom level and this will enable several pitches in Peacock’s at the 40 fathom to be let. A new 15 head set of stamps is expected to assist greatly. A dressing machine of SA construction has been praised, while one sent from England has not performed well. The new local machine follows the pattern of Captain Hancock’s dressing machine at Moonta. The creek sand had proved difficult to treat, but these difficulties had now been overcome.

The Northern Agricultural Areas: from a special reporter.

There is a lengthy description of the new farming area at Belalie and its township of Jamestown extending for a little more than two columns.

The Copper Market. Fluctuations this year have been unpredictable. In May the emergence of a new market in the gun cartridge industry caused the copper price to reach £112 by July, aided by a decline in shipment from Chile. A £4 decline in August was accompanied by news that suggested the decline was unlikely to be permanent. This encouraged new mining companies to arise and existing ones to pay dividends and to place orders for machinery. The mail for September revealed a copper price of £98. Expectations remained, however, that the price would hold at that or even rise. Instead the market declined a further £4. Our telegram of 26 September quotes a price of £94, which corresponds with a message received by Mr E. Cooke of the E. &amp; A. Copper Co., but we believe that Messrs Elder, Smith &amp; Co. have received news of the price being much lower still. The cause of the decline is far from clear.

[The report than cited a whole series of prices on different days in August as the values went up and down between £107 and £99. Prices in September also fluctuated considerably between £101 and £871⁄2.]

The experts seem baffled by the movements.

Reception of the Telegraph Constructors

An article outlines the planned reception at the Adelaide Town Hall for Mr Todd, his officers and men after their arrival on the Omeo, following the completion of the overland telegraph.

Adelaide-London Telegraph

On Tuesday a number of messages, congratulatory and other were received from London. One came for His Excellency from the Agent General and another from Lord Monck, the Chairman of the British-Australian Telegraph Co. In the Afternoon the Mayor of Adelaide received one from the Lord Mayor of London. The text of these telegrams is printed.

Our Gold Fields: the Report of Warden William J. Peterwald.

[There is a report on Echunga, Mt Torrens, Mt Pleasant, Barossa and Ulooloo.]

Ulooloo. This field has not progressed as I had expected it would. Nothing new has been found and the principal workings have been confined to the branch creek. As stated previously, it is difficult to form an accurate impression of the amount of gold raised, but from banks and gold buyers it would seem to be about 4,500 oz from 1 January to 30 October 1872, independent from that raised from private lands. To get this the population has not averaged over 300 men on Crown lands, giving a return, at the rate of £4 per ounce, of £1-10-0 per man per week.

12 November 1872, page 7

Rev. Stanton staged a successful entertainment at the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms on Tuesday. The proceeds of £12-10-0 go to the Charity School instrumentalist. [Performers are listed.]

[The paper of 18 November corrects this report by saying the money was to go towards the purchase of the room in which Rev. Stanton’s school for the poor is held.]

Agriculture. Hay making has begun. The yield is very good and the weather continues to be favourable. Locusts are numerous in the northeast, but so far have not invaded the agricultural areas. Perhaps they have been kept away by the prevailing westerly winds. Snakes are unusually plentiful this year and several have been killed in the township of Kooringa.

Mr Hallett, who is deaf and dumb and has resided in the area for a long time, has had his hand amputated by Dr Dashwood assisted by Dr Wall. This was made necessary after he was bitten by a centipede and the swelling so extended up the arm that his life was feared for. After about a fortnight he is progressing favourably.

18 November 1872, pages 6 &amp; 7

A Service of Praise was produced by members of the Tonic Sol-Fa Classes in the Wesleyan Chapel yesterday (13th). They were under the direction of A.H. Forder. Of particular note was the contribution of a dozen little girls aged 6-9 or 10 who were members of the Band of Hope class and were placed in front of the other choristers. [Details of the hymns and order of service are printed along with names of performers.]

The Aberdeen Lodge holds its meetings in Mr Orchard’s Aberdeen Hotel and on Tuesday they celebrated their anniversary with a dinner in the hotel. About 100 members assembled for the dinner after marching with lodge flag flying to Kooringa. In doing so they frightened a team attached to a dray of wood, so that it bolted up the hill and upset the load. Dr Dashwood presided at first and later P.G. West. P.G. Young of Burra Lodge took the vice-chair. [Toasts are reported, including one by J. McDonald to the health of Mr Todd and his Staff, and success to the Adelaide and London Telegraph.]

P.G. West said the lodge had been founded on 4 August 1858 and flourished until the population had to leave when the Mine ceased working. Even though many members had left and the call on their funds had been serious, they had met all payments without assistance and they had distributed £1,190 as sick relief since their foundation as well as various grants to distressed brethren or their families. Of late there had been a considerable number of initiations and there were 100 members and several applicants. The value of funds and property was £625.

Dog Attack. On Tuesday evening an adopted son of Mr Cheval, who lives near the cemetery, was teasing a ferocious dog when it attacked him. The little fellow was frightfully mutilated before the dog could be secured. He is under the care of Dr Dashwood.

Mt Bryan Flat. 10 December. The first Anniversary services of the Bible Christian Chapel were preached on Sunday by the Rev. J. Rock of Kooringa. On Monday there was a public tea and a meeting chaired by Mr J. Snell of Kooringa. The Trustee Secretary reported a balance of £4 after the payment of interest and other expenses. There is a debt of £100. Proceeds of the services in cash and promises were £50.

The wheat crop looks excellent.

Agriculture. Kooringa area. If the weather remains dry reaping will begin next week. Prospects are good for an abundant harvest. The grain is plump and free from disease. Locusts have done no material damage.

18 December 1872, page 3

Notice. Ford’s four-horse coach continues to run to and from Farrell’s Flat to Clare to meet and return from the train. 1st class ordinary on arrival at Clare at 1 p.m.

Notice. On and after 6 January 1873 an extra coach will leave Kooringa every Monday on the arrival of the first train from Adelaide, for Blinman and all intermediate stations, arriving at Blinman on Wednesday. It will leave Blinman on Thursday and reach Kooringa on Saturday. J. McDonald, Mail Contractor, Redruth.

Appropriation of Funds for Roads

A list of proposed appropriations for new works totalling £11,333-6-8 is printed. After various District Chairmen had made suggestions some alterations were made. The following allocation is relevant to the Burra district. New works north of Burra were increased from £650 to £950. New works between Kooringa and Mt Bryan were increased from £2,200 to £2,400. New works north of Clare received £1,000.

Accident/Obituary. On Friday 13 December a young lad, Frederick Scott, the son of a clerk at the Burra Mine store, was riding in a wood carter’s empty dray when he fell through the insecure bottom as it passed the Aberdeen Hotel. The driver, a son of Mr Hanford a neighbouring farmer, stopped the bullocks. The victim would have escaped unhurt, but in getting up he kicked on of the bullocks and they moved forward. The wheel of the dray crushed the lad’s skull. He was taken up unconscious and died soon afterwards.

[Frederick Scott, born 18 February 1866 Redruth: died 13 December 1872 Burra Mine.]

27 December 1872, page 6

Agriculture. Burra 26 December. The harvest is proving to be one of the best seen in this neighbourhood.

Few farmers are reaping less than 16 bushels per acre and examples of 30-35 and not rare. All now depends on fair weather for the next fortnight to enable the riches of the land to be secured.

Christmas Cheer. Mr McCulloch sent every poor person in the township a plentiful supply of meat and groceries so that they might at least on this occasion spend a merry Christmas.

On Christmas Eve Mr Moody’s china shop stood out. Its decorations consisted of a miniature overshot waterwheel composed of white and gold china eggcups, turned by the water from a tiny fountain. The wheel worked a revolving apparatus containing lighted lamps and surrounded by tasteful decorations. It was very pretty and attracted a crowd of visitors all evening.

The bough decorations outside the shops were very much below the usual standard and were rivalled by those in Aberdeen and Redruth.

2 January 1873, page 6

‘A South Australian’ writes, concerned about what the colony will do with all its wheat. He says this year there is 800,000 acres under wheat, expected to yield 12,000,000 bushels. 2,100,000 bushels will be needed for seed, leaving 9,900,000 bushels for export. After allowing for flour production this means some 260,000 tons for export. This is more than double the 1870 total. Victoria will be in surplus and NSW will require perhaps 25,000 tons. Other established markets another 24,000 tons, leaving a surplus of 211,000 tons. He recommends shipping it to England despite the somewhat lower returns expected from that market. He has no doubts that the rising SA wheat production means that in future the surplus will have to find markets in Europe.

6 January 1873, page 6

Mt Bryan East Agriculture. The harvest continues and is turning out almost equal to expectations. Locusts have done more damage in some places than was expected, but that is confined to small areas. There has been some wind damage too. Scotch thistles are a pest and cannot be controlled while the government roadsides remain an abundant nursery.

Burra Agriculture. The harvest is giving good yields. Locust damage is worse in some places than predicted, but is limited in area.

The New Year. The anniversary of the founding of the colony was not celebrated as a public holiday. On 1 January the Wesleyan Sunday school held a picnic at Princess Royal with the usual array of sports.

Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary on Sunday saw Rev. J. Daniel of Morphett Vale preach the services in the German Church. The children’s treat and the public meeting followed on Monday. About 60 pupils took part in the singing. Proceeds were £13.

18 January 1873, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. The Northern Argus reports the field almost deserted. The Government party remains, but has produced about 10/- worth of gold since June. The storekeeper and publican wander about, surviving on fossicking. Mr Mutton and family also survive on thin pickings.

18 January 1873, page 5

Kooringa Grain. The wheat stack at the railway station grows daily. 15,000 bags are currently stacked in contrast to four or five years ago when it was still considered doubtful whether farming in the area would pay. Farmers have taken over most of the sheep farms in the area, which is now under wheat or being prepared for cultivation.

Burra Mine. The mine is yielding a large quantity of ore and is employing all who have offered their services. 850 tons of ore are at grass. The railways can allocate only one truck per day for ore and this is delaying ore shipment. There are rumours, unsupported by mine authorities, that this state of affairs will cause a curtailment of operations.

30 January 1873, page 11

Redruth Police Station. This establishment has undergone thorough repair and enlargement. The cells have been moved from the interior of the station to the yard and new stabling has been erected. A wall enclosing part of the station, cells and stable has been built and the whole property fenced with a post, rail and three-wire fence.

30 January 1873, page 12

Captain Killicoat of the Burra Mine has had built a handsome residence at Redruth. The builder was W. Bundey and the architect W. Beattie.

Mr G. Gebhardt has had a residence built near Kooringa by Mr Bundey; architect W. Beattie.

Mr T. Porter has made considerable additions and improvements too his house at Koonoona near Kooringa, at a cost of £600. The architect was D. Garlick and the builder T. Baker.

3 February 1873, page 6

The SA Harvest 1872-73. There is a lengthy report on the harvest with paragraphs on the various areas across the colony.

Apoinga. Yield for wheat about 10-12 bushels per acre. Area much the same as the previous year.

Kooringa, Apoinga, Kingston, Hallett, Hanson, Ayers, Reynolds, Andrews, Anne &amp; Whyte. Area sown increased by 25%. Wheat yielding about 14 bushels per acre and 1.5 tons of hay. Two crops in Hd Kingston reduced 5 bushels per acre by locusts. The yields have varied from 10 to 35 bushels per acre.

[See also 11 February page 6.]

8 February 1873, page 5

Burra Harvest Festival. Rev. L.W. Stanton and friends decorated the Anglican Church. [The wording of the report suggests that all the churches held services of thanksgiving at 10.30 a.m.] The afternoon celebrations were arranged by a committee and took place about one mile north of Aberdeen. Two large parallel booths about 50 ft feet long had been erected, with two smaller tents at the end for the supply of mild refreshments. No alcohol was admitted to the event. Schrader’s Band was given a place in front of the chief marquee. Sports included foot races and a cricket match between Single and Married. Mr Bird (the runner) was engaged for the occasion. He was engaged to do 42 laps, but completed only 41, but did so with 11⁄2 minutes to spare and could easily have done the agreed distance within the time allowed. What he did was well-done and to the satisfaction of the public and the person who engaged him. Mr W.H. Rosman captained the married men and W. Young the single man for the cricket game. Stumps were drawn to enable Mr Bird to run at 5 p.m. and the position then was: Singles all out for 75 and Married 5 for 19. About 2,000 people attended the event. The event was a great success and was organised by Rev. Stanton and Rev. J.B. Stephenson, assisted by a number of tradesmen and other inhabitants, though ‘some people having talked a great deal, evidently considered that they should not also be expected to work’.

11 February 1873, page 6

The SA Harvest 1872-73. There is a lengthy report on the harvest with paragraphs on the various areas across the colony.

Hundred of Ayers. Area doubtful. Wheat yield 12-16 bushels per acre.

Mt Bryan Flats. Area sown has doubled and yield about 18 bushels per acre. Disease free and locusts in some areas to the east of the district reduced yields by about 6 bushels per acre.

Black Springs. Area about the same as last year. Yield 12-14 bushels per acre. (The writer thinks this is an over-estimate.)

Mt Bryan East. Yield estimated at 14-15 bushels per acre and would have been more, but for high winds and locusts.

11 February 1873, page 7

Mt Bryan East. Yield of wheat for the season seems to be 14-15 bushels per acre. Wheat was fortunately bagged before a thorough rain on 27-28 January. The crown Lands Ranger is tackling the Scotch thistle problem, but rabbits are on the increase.

14 February 1873, page 5

Redruth Court. A sailor who had probably deserted had been working on a sheep station when he obtained permission from his employer to run up a bill for £3 at a Burra store. He falsely obtained credit for almost £11 and then disappeared to Port Adelaide, where he was captured as he was about to join HMS Clio. He was returned to Redruth and sentenced to 3 months in the local gaol.

Burra Mine. Operations are being pursued with increasing vigour.

14 February 1873, page 6

‘A Patient Sufferer’ writes concerning the blockage of wheat traffic on the Northern Railway. His complaint was that, given a huge piling up of wheat at stations, there seems to be no effort on behalf of the railways to run extra trains or to otherwise expedite the movement of wheat to the port. The want of special trains at night is most apparent and he wonders why the Members of Parliament are not more active in pursuing this matter.

The Wheat Traffic. The editor writes citing the facts of the apparent blockage on the Northern Line. Three weeks earlier the railways advised that they could arrange to move 9,000 tons per week. The statistics are:

Week ending 18 January 6197 tons

25 January 6787

1 February 6068

8 February 6907

And these figures are for total traffic; not just wheat.

We are fortunate that we have not experienced the all too common thunderstorms for this time of year, or much wheat lying around waiting to be moved, would have been damaged.

15 February 1873, page 6

The Bible Christian Tonic Sol-Fa Classes presented a concert with Mr Coumbe adding some solos on the harmonium and the effort raised £7.

A Temperance Meeting was held in the Wesleyan Schoolroom on Tuesday last.

The Wheat Blockade. ‘One Who Also Counts the Trucks’ writes in reply to those complaining about the railways pointing out:

Where is the railway staff to come from for extra movements when the present staff are working 14-20 hours per day?

When would the locomotives be cleaned and/or repaired?

Is it prudent or possible to keep locomotives fired continually for weeks on end?

He then outlines the problems associated with handling the volume of what at the port; pointing out that there is no benefit in getting wheat to the wharf if it cannot be handled there more expeditiously.

W.C. Sanders writes re labourers’ wages.

[His main point was that a list of labourers’ wages to be sent to England was suggesting that they earned 6/- per day. This was true only for the peak of the seasonal work. Most would be glad to get 4/- per day throughout the year. He also says that 6/- a day does not go so far in SA as it would in the UK. What is needed in SA is a great influx of god domestic servants.]

17 February 1873, page 3

The Wheat Glut: A Deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works.

[This is a long report. There were specific proposals about speeding up the sorting of loads for particular ships and the earlier release of trucks for return to the country.

E.W. Pitts spoke (as an agent) for C.B. Fisher of Farrell’s Flat. Wheat was lying exposed to the weather and sales could not be arranged because delivery could not be assured.

Much of the trouble seemed to be at the port.

The Commissioner pointed out that the railways contracted to deliver the grain to the port. They shunted it to the ship, but that was for the convenience of agents; it was not part of their actual contract.

The Engineer-in Chief pointed out that to increase the traffic by 300-440 tons per day would require more engines and more engine-drivers. They were presently running trains up to 11.45 p.m. and the locomotives had to be cleaned and repaired. Loading at the port was slow. The wheat had to be sampled by a man with a long tube and rejected wheat had to be dealt with. Better labelling of the wheat and more careful loading with a view to easier shunting operations and port handling procedures, would be of some help.]

21 February 1873, page 5

The Burra Election. Mr R. Rees spoke at the Aberdeen Hotel on 19 February. Mr Rees reported that an attempt had been made to intimidate him. The Bank of Adelaide had called upon him to pay off his overdraft, if he could afford to run for office. He believed that to be instigated by friends of Mr J. Lindsay. He had paid off his overdraft. The candidate then reiterated his political views.

15 March 1873, page 6

Redruth Primitive Methodist Sunday School held its Anniversary in Sunday. Rev. H.J. Pope preached. Not all those attending could be accommodated inside the chapel. On Monday the pupils and teachers marched around the town before refreshments at 4 p.m. The tea and public meetings were crowded. Mr M. Birt read a report indicating prosperity in every department. Proceeds were £18.

17 March 1873, page 5

Ulooloo Diggings. Mr Thomas Fitzgerald, an old worker at the diggings found a rough nugget weighing one ounce at a depth of 23 feet in Coglin’s Gully. About 20 men are on the field and are said to be making fair wages.

18 March 1873, Supplement page 1

Burra DC. The Institute Committee favoured the use of the Institute by the Council, subject to the Governors of the Institute approving. SAMA had offered the Council an inappropriate piece of land for a Council Chamber and the offer had been declined with thanks. Council will consider the question of assessing the mine property. The proposal for consideration at the next meeting was that buildings would be assessed, but not the mine itself. A man is to be employed to remove burrs and thistles. Chairman and Cr Drew will confer with Mr Furniss re slaughterhouses. Application to be made to SAMA and Yorke’s Peninsula Mining Co. for land to bury dead animals.

19 March 1873, page 6

Rechabite Lodge. Rose of Sharon Tent held its annual festival on Wednesday. Captain Paull presided. Mr Ward hoped that before long a female tent could be started.

24 March 1873, page 5

Wheat Traffic. [The editor has another column reporting the wheat traffic on the railways and giving more details of loadings at individual stations. He concludes that regardless of other factors in causing the blockage, it is imperative that more rolling stock be obtained to handle increasing tonnage as the colony’s wheat production expands in the future. The following figures are a small extract from those cited.

(Figures in tons for the week ending as indicated.)

4 April 1873, page 5

SA Mining Association. The Directors have issued their 28th report, to be laid before a general meeting of shareholders on the 16th April. The Mine is making slow, but steady progress. The work must be regarded as somewhat experimental. The quantity of ore brought to market has increased and there are possibilities that costs could be further reduced. The Directors have secured the services of a new Captain – Mr Robert Sanders, formerly of the Foxdale Mines, Isle of Man. His detailed intended improvements for the mine are a feature of the report. The amount of profit for the six months to 30 September last was £4,168-9-0. and the amount estimated for the half year just closed is only £1,140-12-9 and this depends on the realisation of assets still on hand. The number employed on the property is 314.

18 April 1873, page 6

Easter at Burra. Good Friday was pleasant and Easter Sunday was cloudy with a little evening rain, but on Monday there was thunder, an east wind and drizzle all day. The Anglican Sunday School picnic to Princess Royal was postponed to Tuesday, when it was a success. The Wesleyan Sunday School sports and picnic on Limestone Hill was converted to an indoor event. The Roman Catholic Picnic was postponed to a day to be fixed. On Monday Evening the Burra Christies gave a concert at the Burra Hotel to aid the Catholic Church and despite the weather it was a success.

Rev. L.W. Stanton presented a concert at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room on Tuesday. This raised funds for firewood for the poor.

At the Bible Christian Anniversary Services the Tonic Sol-Fa Choir led by W. Davey, contributed greatly to the success of the occasion, which raised £40.

On Easter Sunday the Wesleyan Sunday School students sang their anniversary hymns and proceeds from this anniversary were c. £30.

Despite the steady rain there was only a little run-off and almost all the rain soaked in, giving an excellent start to the season and raising the spirits of farmers, graziers and tradespeople.

24 April 1873, page 5

St Mary’s Church. Two handsome stained glass windows have lately been given to this church and placed on either side at the east end. One was given by Mrs Winnall as a memorial to the late Mr John Winnall, her husband. He was for some years a Warden of the church and Superintendent of the Sunday school. The other was given by several seatholders in memory of their children. The memorials were executed by Mr Brooks of North Adelaide.

The subject of the children’s window is Christ blessing little children with the emblems of the font and the dove, the names and dates of the deaths of the children and the text ‘Suffer little children to come unto me’.

The other’s theme is Christ’s blessing the bread and the wine. This has as symbols the pelican, the sacred monogram (ΑΩ) with emblems of the crucifixion: nails, hammer, crown of thorns, sponge, spear etc. and the text ‘This do in remembrance of me’.

[These two windows were subsequently removed from St Mary’s on Limestone Hill to the new St Mary’s where they can still be seen (January 2012), though I cannot see the text cited for the Winnall window and the bread and wine blessing is obscure.]

29 April 1873, page 7

Burra DC. The tender of Mr Baker for office furniture was accepted for £13. The assessment was received and examined. The land was considered to be valued too high in relation to house property and so was reduced by 10%. A few other changes were made.

1 May 1873, page 5

Waukaringa Gold Field. James Watson has discovered gold in quartz specimens from Wankaringa [sic] Run leased by George Hiles of Munjibbie. The site is 100 miles northeast of Kooringa in flat country of which the chief characteristics are micaceous schist, slat, hornblende and sandstone with granite intervening between the five leads that have been laid open. The leaders vary from 6-8 inches to 12-14 inches and dip eastwards at one foot in twenty. The discoverer and friends intend to erect machinery and work the affair without forming a company. The samples seen look promising and water is said to be obtainable at 40 ft.

6 May 1873, page 7

English &amp; Australian Copper Co.

The ordinary general meeting was held on 27 February. For the 12 months to 30 June 1872 the company had ore, regulus etc handled had been 6564 tons compared with 5441 the previous year. The copper made at the Port Adelaide smelter had been 1535 tons compared with 1518 tons the previous 12 months. The board had declared the 21st dividend of 2/6 per share. With the interim dividend paid in September, this gave a 10% dividend for the year, plus £1,750 paid to the Reserve Fund. A fall of £13 per ton in the value of copper had prevented the even better returns predicted at the last meeting from being achieved. With prices seemingly now more settled at between £90 and £100 per ton the future looked very promising. The opening of the telegraph link between Adelaide and Darwin on 21 October would be advantageous and prevent agents in London buying at higher prices when a drop had occurred here. They had hoped that the Burra Mine would have contributed very much more than it had in the past year. This had been because of the non-completion of the dressing machinery on that property. This should soon be rectified and there was every reason to expect they would soon receive very large supplies from that mine. Their agent had been negotiating for Queensland ores and when these ores were obtained no smelting company would be in a better position. ‘They possessed excellent works on the Burra Burra property at Adelaide, and now at their new works at Newcastle, which were situated actually at the pit’s mouth.’

8 May 1873, page 5

Malachite. In referring to a recent paragraph reporting malachite at the Stanley Mine near Clare, Mr J.B. Austin reports that he has got malachite at three other localities in the north; from Wheal Frost about 200 miles north of Pt Augusta, on another section then believed to belong to the Daly and Stanley Mining Association and at Blinman.

22 May, 1873, page 5

Mt Bryan Grievances. At a recent meeting at the Mt Bryan Hotel the dangerous state of the road between the inn and Hanford’s was said to require immediate attention. Mr Tregellan thought a District Council for the Hundreds of Kingston and Hallett was needed. Mr Marchant thought they should raise the sum needed among themselves and not be subject to the mercies of a council. There was only one really bad spot. Mr C. Dawson said the other day his horse would not face that spot and he had had great difficulty in getting home. Mr R. Collins thought that £20 would meet the needs and that residents would be prepared to contribute. Mr J.B. Bull thought any sum collected should be memorialised for subsidy. Mr Ind wanted a decision delayed so that wood carters could be involved as they were great users of the road. Mr Collins thought delay would double the cost. He did not think a Council needed at present. A committee was formed and a subscription list opened. It was also resolved to petition for a post office and a polling place.

Burglary at Burra. Mr W.R. Ridgway was robbed on 25 May when someone removed a pane of glass and entered his bedroom and then the shop. The robber obtained a few coppers from the shop and half a sovereign from a cash box.

The Northern Railways. A meeting was held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel, Kooringa on 17 June to consider improvements to the train timetables. Captain Killicoat presided and considered the railways were conducted in an unsatisfactory manner. 13 towns would be represented at a meeting at Saddleworth soon and he expected a deputation would then wait on the Commissioner of Public Works.

Mr T. Moody saw no reason why Burra should not have two mails a day, as at Kapunda.

J.D. Cave could not see why third class carriages could not be attached to all trains. Wheat storage needed to be improved so that it was not damaged while awaiting clearance from the station.

M.H. Furniss agreed with that and thought that wheat, copper, fuel, iron, building materials, manure etc. should all be carried at lower rates that articles of luxury.

J.R. Stephens complained that Clare did not have a connecting coach for the early morning train. Overcharging for parcels from Gawler to Burra had come to his notice. He wanted a morning and an afternoon train with second and third class accommodation.

O. Harvey moved to appoint representatives to attend the Saddleworth meeting.

P. Lane agreed and wanted better third class accommodation; at present third class passengers had to share their train with sheep and cattle and times of departure needed changing as well.

Mr E. Lipsett agreed with Mr Lane.

T. Warnes thought the charges to transport sheep and cattle were exorbitant. The railways wanted £55 to get a flock to Adelaide. He hired a drover and moved them for £9.

W.R. Ridgway though the charges for both goods and passengers were far too high.

J.D. Cave wanted excursion tickets for third class as well as second class.

Motions supporting all the above views were carried.

Ulooloo. The first Sunday School Anniversary was preached at Ulooloo by Rev. Wilson. On Monday the students were conveyed by wagons to a site near Messrs Stephens and Brayley’s station for sports and a luncheon. About 200 children attended. Tea followed the sports and Mr Wilson gave a talk reminiscing about missionary life. Other recitations, addresses and songs followed and £12-11-0 was raised. The school has been established for ten months only.

Saddleworth Railway Meeting. The meeting was held 25 June. The report comes from the Northern Argus.

Delegates were sent from Burra (Killicoat, Dawson &amp; Drew), Hanson, Clare, Saddleworth, Auburn, Tarlee, Rhynie, Waterloo, Mintaro and Riverton. Captain Killicoat chaired the meeting.

Captain Killicoat said they effectively had only one train a day because the first did not carry third class passengers and the second did not carry first and second class passengers.

Mr Dawson called for immediate and radical change, saying, ‘that in no country in the world except here did it take eight and a quarter hours to travel 100 miles.’

Mr Moule proposed there be a morning and evening train each day for first, second and third class passengers and for the mail.

Mr Faulkner moved for the abolition of the fortnightly pay train. The first train should stay as long as possible at Burra, leaving in time to catch the Kapunda midday train at Gawler.

Mr Hosier said the run between Burra and Adelaide should be done in 41⁄2 hours. It should leave Burra about 7 a.m. and Adelaide about 4 p.m.

A reduction in tariffs was discussed, but in the end it was deemed inadvisable to ask for that at present.

A proposal that each station on the line should have a goods shed was carried.

A deputation was elected to wait on the Commissioner of Public Works.

2 July 1873, page 5

The Northern Railways. The editor seems suspicious of the Commissioner’s undertaking to do all he can to improve the service. He fears the promises all sound rather vague. He doubted that the timetable could be so arranged to allow a business trip to Adelaide and back in a day, but that is a key ambition of the complainants. If he reduces the travel time it will have to be by reducing time spent at stations because the light line between Roseworthy and Burra can hardly accommodate speeds greater than 25 m.p.h. with safety. Major problems are the revelations by Mr Mais that there is a lack of locomotive power, that if one engine were to break down there is not another to replace it, and that the present stock of locomotives have almost been worked to pieces. A couple of new engines and some rolling stock have been ordered, but this should have been fitted into last year’s estimates.

Obituary and Inquest.

An inquest was held at the residence of Mr F. Wark of Apoinga on Thursday evening 3 July to inquire into the death of James Stevens who was killed the previous day when a field roller passed over him.

Francis Wark said:

Yesterday morning I told deceased to roll with three horses and sent Andrew Croker to see him properly started. I went myself afterwards and accompanied him for a short time, leaving about 9 a.m. Saw deceased walking behind the roller at 11.30 a.m. Went into the house with Mr Earle and at about noon Andrew Croker came in and said Jim is killed. Deceased was alive, but he died about 10 minutes later after I had sent for the doctor. Believe the centre of the roller passed over him. It would weigh quite a ton. The reins were under the roller and under the deceased’s back. The horses were perfectly quiet and I believe the deceased was competent to drive them.

Andrew Croker gave evidence of finding the deceased. Agreed that the deceased was competent to drive the horses. Added nothing of substance to the above.

A.W. Walls, a doctor, testified that death was caused by a fractured skull and confirmed that the marks on the body were consistent with a roller passing over him.

J.M. Lillecrap said deceased had been living with him for almost three years. Thought he had a step-father somewhere and a brother and sister. Said he was over eight years old when he came to live with me. Latterly has been working with Mr Wark. He was usually employed looking after cattle and driving horses. Considered him quite capable of managing horses. He had been driving horses for two years in the spring and at harvest.

The verdict was death by a roller accidentally passing over him and they considered him quite competent to drive the horses in the roller.

[There are a number of problems with tracing this death. James Stephen is registered as dying aged 11 at Apoinga on 18 July 1873, and despite the date this seems likely to be the right person. If so he may have been the son of a Prudence Budge and to have been born 20 July 1861 at Kooringa as James Peter Stevens; father William Peter Richards. Prudence Budge had ten registered children in the Burra district, variously to William Peter Richards, John Symons, John Stephens and Henry Thomas. She married the last named at the Wesleyan Parsonage Kooringa 1 December 1865 when she was 33 and he was 45. She was then calling herself Prudence Stephens. There is no record in SA of any previous marriage for Prudence Budge. Prudence Thomas died 1 September 1870 at Kooringa aged 39. This fits in with the statement that he had a stepfather and siblings, but no mention of a mother.]

Obituary. The Hon. John Bentham Neales.

For some time it has been known that the health of this old colonist has been far from robust. Towards the end of the last session of Parliament he had to absent himself from the Legislative Council with sick leave. Although he had since then partially recovered, the unfavourable symptoms returned and on Thursday they terminated fatally. Since his arrival in 18828 his name has been honourably linked with the commerce and politics of this province. Upon arrival he and another gentleman commenced trading as general merchants. Towards the close of the year he succeeded Mr R. Cock as auctioneer, and shortly afterwards he was appointed by the Government to act in that capacity. His geniality, quaint wit and shrewd business knowledge peculiarly adapted him for the pursuit of public salesman and he attained great success and popularity in it. In 1840 he and several other influential persons formed the Adelaide Auction Co. and for many years he wielded the hammer for them. He early displayed an interest in the mineral interests of the colony and it is with these that he has been most thoroughly and heartily identified. More than anyone else he merits the title of Father of Mining in SA. He has spent large sums of money testing localities where metals were supposed to be buried and always directed his influence and advocacy to the advancement of bona fide mining. He was the first to start the search for gold in the vicinity of Montacute and was an original shareholder in the famed Burra Burra Mine. It would be impossible here to list the scores of other mining ventures he has supported. In 1849 he was a keen supported of the proposal to build a railway to Port Adelaide and was appointed to that undertaking’s committee. From its commencement he was a leading proprietor in the Port Land Company. Up to 1842 he was generally known as Mr Neales Bentham to prevent confusion with another person in the colony then engaged in mercantile pursuits. Since then he has been known by his proper name. In 1846 he was among speakers at a public meeting protesting the importation of juvenile offenders known as Parkhurst Boys, from their having been confined in the Reformatory of that name. The indignant protests of the colonists prevailed and home authorities withdrew the proposal. In 1851 he was speaking at large protests against transportation to the Australian colonies. Shortly before this he had been appointed to the Board of City Commissioners, which office he retained until the election of the first City Council under the Act of 1849. His standing in the community was demonstrated when he was returned as a member of the first Legislative Council as the Member for North Adelaide, defeating Mr P. Cumming. In 1855 he was returned for the same constituency, defeating Mr Alexander Hay. In this period he introduced and managed to get passed, a measure for the registration of Joint-Stock Companies and for limiting their liability. His sympathies were always on the side of liberality and progress. His vote assisted in passing many of the reforms, which from time to time have been made in the colony. In 1852 he was a member of the Select Committee to investigate amending the constitution. Three years later he sat on a committee charged with examining plans and specifications for assuring Adelaide had a permanent water supply and an efficient system of drainage. He was also for several years on the Board of the Botanic Garden. The respect in which he was held saw his return in 1857 to the first SA Parliament under the new Constitution Act. He was one of six members chosen to represent the city in the House of Assembly. Two years later when F.S. Dutton resigned he joined the Ministry as Commissioner of crown Lands, but held the office only briefly, retiring from Parliament at the next election. In 1862 he re-entered the House of Assembly as a member for Burra. In conjunction with Mr Cole he represented that district in two Parliaments. In a third his partner was Mr Boucaut. In 1865 he succeeded in getting passed a bill empowering the formation of Companies and Associations of miners with limited liability. From November 1865 to March 1866 he was Commissioner of Crown Lands in Captain Hart’s Government. In 1870 he was defeated at the election, but two months later was elected unopposed to as eat in the Legislative Council. His genial disposition and companionable character secured for himself a large circle of friends. His business capabilities raised him to a high rank in commercial circles. In politics he was less ambitious than some, but a diligent legislator. As a speaker he was fluent and always entertaining. His style was epigrammatic and his speeches, even on the driest of subjects were full of natural humour and abounded in anecdotes. His death will be extensively regretted. He is survived by a widow, two sons and three daughters. Of the latter, one is married to Rev. Thomas Field M.A. and another to Mr J.L. Field.

The late Hon. John Bentham Neales was interred in the family vault at Brighton on Saturday 2 August. At his wish the funeral was conducted in the quietest and most unostentatious manner. Three mourning coaches conveyed the family and there were about 12 or 14 other coaches carrying close neighbours and business friends. Rev. T. Field, a son-in-law of the deceased conducted the service in St Jude’s Church. Shops at Glenelg and Brighton were closed as a mark of respect.

The Prospectus for the New Burra Copper Mining Co. is printed. It will have a capital of £16,000 in 6,000 shares of £2 each. The object is to purchase from the present owners all their interest in mineral licences 4821 &amp; 4998, containing 80 acres each and located on the Bundaleer Run about one mile north of the River Broughton. The present owners have found a lode of high percentage ore, needing only the outlay of capital to develop the find. The location is only 25 miles from the Farrell’s Flat railway station via a level road. Captain Dunstan and Mr Thomas Pascoe have inspected the site and endorse its development.

The Waukaringa Gold Reefs. The correspondent of the Northern Argus reports travelling to the field via Mt Bryan and Hallett and thence to Mr A. McCulloch’s station, Gottlieb’s Well. Then via the Deep Well, Nackara creek to McKoy’s Well where he stopped overnight. The gold reefs are about 20 miles beyond Waukaringa Run. The extent of the reefs east and west is marked by a line of white flags. Another line goes north and south. The line is pegged on the supposed course of a gold-bearing leader from which the Waukaringa co. is getting some very good stone. The party at Waukaree (from Burra) have struck another leader and are raising promising stone. [The report continues with further details.]

Inquest &amp; Obituary.

An inquest was held on 21 August at the Aberdeen Hotel into the death of John Mogford, hawker, whose body was found within a few miles of Gottlieb’s Well Head Station.

Vincent Hanson reported seeing the deceased about midday on Monday about two miles from Gottlieb’s. Mogford was driving a spring cart and returned his greeting. He had taken deceased for a half-caste; much discoloured about the face. He went to the station and on returning about 40 minutes later met Morris Rayner going for Mr McCulloch. He said deceased was lying on the road about two feet from his cart. Hanson went to the body, helped to straighten it out and then went to the Survey Camp to consult Mr Elder who was in charge. They put the body into his cart and went towards Gottlieb’s, but on hearing no one was there they started back to the camp. Witness then went to Mr Goode of Canowie, the nearest JP. He advised Mr Rayner to ride into Burra and report the death to the police.

Morris Rayner reported meeting the deceased’s cart with his body hanging over the near shaft with his right foot under the foot board. Alfred Watson, a lad was with Rayner and Michael Dowd, a man, was walking about 100 yards behind. He and Dowd lifted the body down to the ground.

Eliza Fisher of Burra said she had lived with the deceased for 15 years, but was not married to him. He had been ailing for ten years from a liver complaint and sometimes had fits when he drank, which he did heavily. Deceased had been away about five weeks, took no drink with him and had not seen a doctor for three years.

Dr William Henry Dashwood said he had known the deceased for several years, but never attended him professionally. He had no hesitation is saying the man had died from apoplexy.

Lance Corporal W. Smith had attended when told of the incident. He had found on him a bill, a comb, 32/6 in silver, a half-penny, three £1 notes, and orders on Elder, Smith &amp; Co. as well as a letter addressed to J. Biglands, Peninsula, Port Adelaide. His load had consisted of groceries, skins etc.

The verdict was that the deceased had died on 18 August of apoplexy.

Mt Bryan East. The weather has been dry and frosty with ice nearly a quarter of an inch thick and snow on the Mount. A good rain last week improved conditions. Early planted crops are looking well, but later plantings are backward because of the cold weather.

Burra. Considerable improvements are being made here. Messrs Lane, Geake and Waters have each improved their premises. A brewery is being erected and so is a Catholic Church. Several buildings are being erected in Aberdeen. Although Burra pays for two policemen one of them is now temporarily located at Clare, so when one has to travel away, as in the case of the death of John Mogford, the town is unprotected.

Inquest &amp; Obituary.

An inquest was held at the White Hart Hotel on 24 August by J.D. Cave. Frederick Tiptaft’s body had been found in his bed the previous afternoon.

James Kearse, carpenter, of Teatree Gully, said he had been working on Friday 22nd in the carpenter’s shop at G. Gebhardt’s building at Hallett. [Ian Auhl has added a pencilled note that this was actually Gebhardt’s ‘Wildotta’ at Mt Bryan, now known as ‘Mackerode’.] When he went into make his tea at 5 p.m. he heard someone breathing heavily or snoring in an adjoining bedroom and went to investigate. He found the deceased apparently asleep. Called Arthur Tuckey and asked what was wrong and was told Tiptaft had been drinking. At 7.10 on the 23rd deceased was in the same state. At 8 a.m. he and Tuckey washed the deceased’s face and tried to wake him. He had not seen the deceased take any alcohol and deceased had worked on Friday and seemed in good health. For several days he had been complaining of dysentery and passing blood. Only thought he had been drinking because Tuckey had said he had been on the grog. At 11 a.m. he seemed worse and at 12.30 p.m. Tuckey went to Wildotta for a horse to fetch a doctor, but deceased was dead before he returned.

Arthur Tuckey, a carpenter of North Adelaide said that on 22nd a trolley had come to remove some scaffolding and the driver, George Jordan, had some rum with him. The witness, Tiptaft and Sinclair Moodie each had three drinks of the rum. Deceased did not appear drunk when he went into the house. Jordan left with the remaining rum at about 4.45 p.m.

Sinclair Moodie gave corroborative evidence and so did George Jordan, saying that he had had three or four drinks with two carpenters and the painter; the deceased.

Lance-Corporal William Smith of Redruth said he was informed of the death on 23rd, but having a sick horse to attend to, he informed the Kooringa police and they sent Dr Dashwood to investigate the death. When he had got to the body later, Smith found the deceased had a letter addressed W. Tiptaft, a watch and key and nine pence.

Dashwood was not prepared to give a cause of death without an autopsy and the inquest was accordingly adjourned. An hour later Dashwood reported that the deceased had died from hypertrophy of the liver and fatty degeneration of the heat, probably accelerated by intemperate habits. He had taken insufficient food to support life. The verdict was in accord with the doctor’s report.

[Frederick Tiptaft died 23 August 1873, Wildoto (sic) aged 39.]

Mt Bryan Flat. There has been rain and the crops are looking good. The host of the Mt Bryan Hotel is about to erect a booth at the Waukaringa Gold Field. The road between Burra and Mt Bryan Flat is bad and drays and wagons are being bogged daily.

Kooringa. The recent fine weather suits the farmers, but we hear more rain is needed on the eastern runs.

An entertainment featuring Mr Lipsett’s readings, and musical items under the direction of Mr A.H .Forder raised about £3 for the Redruth chapel Bazaar Fund.

An entirely local company; the Great Extended Waukaringa Co., of 20,000 shares was started without brokers of free shares in about one hour.

Shearing is becoming general with teams loaded with provisions and numbers of shearers leaving the town every week.

Re Frederick Tiptaft.

James Willshire of Hindley Street, Adelaide, writes re the Tiptaft inquest. He says he knew the deceased for over two years and cannot understand how the jury came to the verdict, charging him with intemperance – ‘which must cast a severe reflection on the poor fellow’s memory, and be a lasting disgrace and ignominy to his disconsolate widow and his five young children.’

‘The deceased had passed through all the privations and exposures of the Crimean War, having been connected with one of the earliest detachments that were sent out and one of the latest that arrived home. Subsequently he occupied a respectable position in the London City and Metropolitan Police Force, and has since been an officer at the Yatala Labour Prison. Neither of these appointments was conducive to good health, and it is quite certain a man of intemperate habits could not for any length of time have occupied such positions. During his lifetime also he received marks of honour from the British and Turkish Governments.’

8 September 1873, page 7

Re Frederick Tiptaft

The editor reports the receipt of letters from James Willshire, George Dodgson of Leigh St, A.W. Potter, W. Becker watchmaker of Hindley St, C. Tubb painter and glazier of North Adelaide, all testifying to the deceased’s sobriety and Mrs Tiptaft also assures us of his sobriety of habit and is very distressed by the verdict. Her husband had for some time suffered from heart disease. We have also seen a letter from John Fisher to Ven. Archdeacon Marryat, which says in part ‘... I had many opportunities of seeing him while he was guard at the Yatala Labour Prison, and have never seen him at all the worse for liquor, and have never heard of his being addicted to habits of intemperance; indeed, I always considered him a respectable well-conducted man, rather above the position he held at the Prison.’

Railway access. It is strange that Burra is the only town without direct access to the railway station for teams. Loads from the northeast, whence there is great traffic, have to travel along the banks of the Burra creek a considerable distance before they can cross. ‘Private enterprise, however, is about to remedy the difficulty, for this week five or six teams have been carting slag from the old Smelting Works to make a ford opposite the Railway Station. This will make a saving of at least two miles of cartage.’

[This is not entirely clear, but it seems to suggest they were constructing a ford near the Bon Accord Hotel, which in turn would imply that previously teams had to travel along the north side of the creek, until they could cross at Young Street, and then climb the hill via Morehead Street to the railway station.]

Cricket. Few cricketers are responding to calls to practise. Apparently the town will be one of the few not to support a cricket club this season.

3 October 1873, page 3

The season. Farmers are looking for rain, but so far the crops are healthy. Locusts are beginning to appear in the northeast. Shearing is general and reports are of a good clip.

Kooringa Wesleyan Church held its Anniversary services on Sunday. Preachers were Rev. J.B. Stephenson and Mr J. Jeffrey. The tea meeting was held on Monday and the total proceeds were £80.

On Tuesday in the Wesleyan Chapel Rev. S. Knight delivered his interesting address on ‘The Sun’. The collection aided the Trust Fund.

11 October 1873, page 6

The season. Rain is needed and crops are beginning to be stressed. Wool is arriving fast at the station and by all accounts the clip is very good.

The Bishop of Adelaide preached at St Mary’s on Sunday to large congregations. Collections were made to aid the Parsonage Fund.

Rev. L.W. Stanton produced an entertainment at the Burra Hotel on Tuesday evening, comprising readings, songs, duets, trios and piano pieces. Mrs Alfred Cave, the wife of Dr Cave, who has lately arrived, contributed sweet songs, which were widely appreciated. [Other performers are listed.] £7 was collected for St Mary’s Day School.

Waukaringa Reefs. News continues to be promising.

Burra DC. The council has let several contracts to improve the roads in Kooringa and apparently by next winter the residents will have ‘at least a moderately clean pathway over some of the worst parts of the town.’

13 October 1873, page 6

‘A Burra Elector’ writes re the northern extension of the railway.

On Thursday your issue reports Mr Rowland Rees MP as saying that Burra people did not want the line extended north from Burra, but rather from Farrell’s Flat. I don’t know where he got this idea; certainly not from Burra. He should be careful to ascertain people’s wishes before advocating the views of other people.

Also re those who say the lands east of Burra should not be opened to agriculture because they will not support cropping. They would not say so had they seen the samples of grain from these lands last season. There are numbers of farmers anxious to see the areas thrown open for selection and Mr Rees would do well to agitate this question in the House.

Booborowie. Shearing has commenced with the promise of an abundant clip.

Burr and Scotch thistle are a threat, but Ranger Coglin has been indefatigable against them.

Mr A. Perkins, a teamster, having had a stroke, has been conveyed to Adelaide.

Burra Mine. The report and balance sheet for the SAMA state that the half-yearly yield has increased to upwards of 1,800 tons of copper ore, averaging 18%. Operations for the six months to 31 March including rents etc. have yielded a net profit of £1,869-11-3. It is also reported that in the last half year much work of a permanent character has been done and this will mean income will barely meet expenditure. Captain Sanders says he is confident of the ultimate success of the undertaking. He is convinced that the mine contains two or more distinct lodes traversed by several cross-courses causing intersections and dislocations, ‘which we always considered desirable in a mining property’. There are 314 hands employed.

17 October 1873, page 3

Ulooloo. Crops have been looking promising, but rain is now needed.

Shearing has finished at several stations and continues at others. On the whole the clip has been highly satisfactory. The adjoining Hundred has not been declared and so there have been few new settlers in the past year. The Ulooloo School, opened last year, has over 60 pupils. One opened at Hallett, alias ‘Willigoleech’ [sic], a few weeks ago, has more than 20 scholars. The diggings here have 15 or 16 men at work.

22 October 1873, page 7

The English &amp; Australian Copper Co.

The half-yearly meeting was held 28 August. Mr R.A. Routh chaired the meeting. The chairman said no doubt shareholders would be disappointed. At the time of the last meeting the Directors had hoped to present a healthy credit balance instead of there being a debit. He said they would not really know the company’s situation until a full stocktaking at the end of the full year. A considerable quantity of ore had been taken into the accounts at cost price, but the profits of which would not come in until the second half. One problem had been that three quarters of the ore purchased had been acquired during the interruption to the telegraph cable. The manager expected that the business for 1873-74 was likely to be more than double that for 1872-73 and copper prices had been rising. The workings to 31 December 1872 showed a deficiency of £3,676-4-4 and that would almost absorb the balance of undistributed profit brought forward.

24 October 1873, page 3

Kooringa. Many shearers are daily passing through the town at the end of the shearing season.

S. Drew &amp; Co. have accepted tenders for the construction of a large wholesale store near the railway station. They and others are anticipating changes due to the extension of the railway. Drew’s store will be capable of holding 3,400 tons of goods. A public house and various other buildings, it is understood, are also to be erected close to the same place. The new brewery [in Kooringa] is nearing completion.

24 October 1873, page 5

The Season. There is an extensive report on northern area crops.

Kooringa 22 October: There has been some light rain, but hot winds have countered the effect and rain is much needed. Crops, particularly those late sown, are backward. Grasshoppers are rumoured to have appeared in various places.

Mt Bryan East. The last month has been very dry, with a few showers last Thursday and Friday. Grasshoppers are innumerable in some patches. Calm days alternate with near hurricane conditions.

Burra DC. 25 November. While repairs are made at Moonlight Hill the road will be diverted through James Harris’s land sections 224 &amp; 225. The Road Board will attend to the road near the White Hart Inn. A rate of 18 pence was adopted. A special grant will be sought for the road to the Burra Railway Station.

SA Parliament

Mr Rees proposed that the lands east of Burra be included within the operation of the Waste Lands Alienation Act of 1872. [That is would be made available for selection for farming.]

Mr Rees said he had received a letter from a prominent citizen there who said that if polled the citizens of Burra would strongly support opening the lands to settlement. It might be hard to take those lands from those presently making their living from them, were it not for the principle that land suited for agriculture must be thrown open for that purpose. It was said the lands were beyond Goyder’s Line of Rainfall, but he was informed that directly after the line was drawn the heaviest rains for some years were experienced there. ‘Goyder’s rainfall had been thought by the majority of persons to be a popular fiction.’ Mr Solomon interjected: ‘No.’

‘He thought in the language of a well-known agriculturalist, there was no part of South Australia that could not be applied to farming. It was suggested that this action was being taken by a few miserable storekeepers in the Burra. But they were men such as Mr Drew, Mr Dawson, Mr Lane and Mr Ridgway, and presuming the land were not fitted for agriculture the result would be disastrous to the storekeepers, who would have to give credit.’

‘Mr Simms would emphatically state, from his own knowledge, that the land was unfit for agriculture and in that statement he was borne out by Mr Goyder’s report ... Supposing persons complied with the Act, they would simply take the land next to the water for agriculture, and use the rest for pastoral purposes, and he did not think it right to turn one class out for the benefit of another.’

Mr Mann, the Attorney General said he would also have to oppose the motion, having discussed the matter with Mr Goyder. The few suitable sections would not pay for the cost of survey.

Mr Townsend agreed there were but three or four blocks fit for agriculture.

The motion was negatived.

Further consideration of £750 for the Institute at Kooringa was called and not being proceeded with went off the paper. [But see 11 December 1875, page 6.]

Burra Institute. Mr Rees moved in Parliament that provision be made to grant £750 for the enlarging of the Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute at Kooringa. The motion was amended with the condition that £250 be raised by private subscription and that the date of the grant be changed from 1874 to 1874-75. It was then carried.

Christmas Benevolence at Kooringa

Mr A. McCulloch of Princess Royal is in the habit of supplying those in want in the neighbourhood with the necessary rations for a Christmas feast. This year the rations so distributed consisted of: a quarter of a sheep, 4 lb of bread, 12 lb of flour, 8 lb potatoes, 4 lb sugar, 1⁄2 lb tea, 2 lb currants, 1 lb raisins, 1⁄4 lb lemon peel and 1 oz spice. This was for a small family, with the quantities doubled for a large family. The supplies were nicely parcelled and delivered before 7 o’clock on 24th December. The persons and quantities were left to the discretion of several persons appointed by Mr McCulloch. 50 families benefited and 3,120 lbs of provisions were distributed.

The Woolcock Murder Case

‘With our last Summary we published an account of the trial and conviction of Mrs Woolcock for the murder of her husband by poison. It is stated by a Moonta paper that Mrs Woolcock was born at the Burra. Her parents’ name was Oliver, and while she was a child they proceeded to Victoria, taking her with them, where she resided some years. It is stated that when about nine or ten years of age an American black committed a criminal assault upon her, for which he was convicted and hanged. A few years since she arrived with her mother at Moonta Mines, the father being reported to have died in Victoria. The accuracy of the report was questioned; but whether correct or not, the mother, soon after her arrival at Moonta married a man named Johns. He died a few years subsequently; the mother returned to Victoria. At Moonta Mines the daughter became intimate with the Woolcock family, consisting of the husband, wife and two sons. About seven years since the wife died, and Miss Oliver was engaged by Woolcock as housekeeper, in which capacity she remained for several months, when he married her. Woolcock lost by death his eldest son also, which event, we are informed, occurred before his second marriage. As to Mrs Woolcock’s general character, a person who lived next door to her on the Mines for about six years after her marriage to Woolcock tells us that at all times she appeared at all times to conduct herself with propriety, her behaviour not differing from that of ordinary respectable women. Sometime prior to the death of Woolcock the family removed to Yelta, and were residing there at the period of Woolcock’s decease. Mrs Woolcock’s age is stated to be about 27. The extreme penalty of the law was carried out at Adelaide Gaol on Tuesday morning the 30 December. The convict has been attended since her conviction by the Rev. J. Bickford, and after his first visit manifested great penitence, and seemed to be perfectly resigned to the fate which she knew awaited her. In the spare leaf of her Bible, between the Old Testament and the New, it was found she had inscribed a few words to her memory, mentioning her name, her age, and the date of her death. She also made a full confession of her guilt, stating that she had not been very well treated, and had been tempted by Satan to carry out the act. The hour fixed for the execution was 8 o’clock, and at that time she was taken from the condemned cell, accompanied by the Rev. J. Bickford and the Governor of the Gaol. She walked to the place of execution and ascended the scaffold without saying anything. The Rev. J. Bickford, having offered prayer, the rope was adjusted, and after the usual formalities the bolt was drawn. Death did not immediately ensue. Fully five minutes elapsed before the convulsions of the body ceased, but it was afterwards ascertained that dislocation was produced when the drop fell.

The Burra Races were held at Copperhouse in a paddock lent by the SAMA on 1 &amp; 2 January. There were many spectators considering the time of year, which is busy for farmers. The grandstand was packed. Mr A. Stewart catered. The Town Plate carried the largest prize, but was contested by only two horses. It was won by Mr J.J. Swinden’s b.m. Sunbeam, aged 5 years and carrying 9 st 11 lb and ridden by Jenkins.

[The prize is not mentioned here, but on 22 November 1873 the paper indicates that the plum race would carry a prize of 75 sovereigns. The result of each race is printed.]

The settling took place at Mr Opie’s Smelter’s Home Hotel, Redruth after the second day’s racing.

Northern Floods. Sudden storms caused great floods at Clare, Auburn, Saddleworth, Rhynie and Undalya, but there is no mention of rain at Burra.

Obituary. Mr William Peacock arrived in the colony in the ship Glenalvon 28 December 1838. Within three years he took part in an important meeting on the future of the colony. In 1842 he became a member of the City Council as an Alderman. He always supported the voluntary system in religious matters and took an active part in meetings on the subject in 1846. In 1848-49 he was active in the movement for responsible government and in 1851 was returned as a Member for Noarlunga, defeating Major O’Halloran. Four years later he was re-elected and served till 1856. In 1861 he entered the Legislative Council, retiring due to the effluxion of time in 1869. As a politician he was decidedly Liberal. In Commercial circles he will be remembered as the founder and head of the well-known tanning and wool-scouring firm of W. Peacock &amp; Son. He was also a large holder of real property. For long he was a deacon of what is now known as the Hindmarsh Square Congregational Church, though latterly he worshipped at Stow Memorial Church. His health has been in decline for some time and his death on Tuesday 20 January was not unexpected. He was in his 84th year. He is survived by a widow, one son, Caleb Peacock (manager of the firm for some time) and one daughter, Mrs Weston, relict of the late Dr Weston of Victoria. [William Peacock died 20 January 1874, Hackney aged 83.]

[Not mentioned here is that he was a major shareholder in the SA Mining Association.]

Floods. Kooringa 19 January. On Friday floods were experienced, which were the heaviest for two years. It rained from 3 to 7 o’clock. The Northeast Mail, which starts at 4 p.m., was unable to cross Firewood Creek and had to return, though it got through later that night. The total fall was 23⁄4 inches. The creek ran a banker and streets were torrents, but little damage was reported. A couple of houses were swamped along with J.R. Stephens’ stable. Farmers and teamsters will benefit from full waterholes and dams. It will greatly benefit the Eastern Plains, where little rain has fallen for two or three years.

Mt Bryan East. The harvest is over and the crops very light; 11⁄2 to 7 bushels per acre. A storm on Sunday 11 January was concentrated in an area about two miles square. The resulting flood destroyed fencing on Mr Montgomery’s next to Mr Robert’s property. From Robert’s the flood went on to Mr Gilbert’s paddock and rushed along to the station, carrying all before it. It destroyed pigsties, stone closets, fences and a large iron pump, which was wrenched from the well and carried away. A 400 gallon tank containing 8 cwt of fat was swept away and reduced to pieces.

Burra DC. 20 January. An old mine shaft at Redruth will be inspected. Owners of land with star thistle on it will be advised of the need to destroy them under the Thistle and Burr Act.

Hallett Races were held on Wednesday 25 March at this rising town formerly known by the name of Uindy or Willigoleche. The course was in Messrs Ferrier &amp; Low’s large stubble paddock near the hotel. Though the weather was favourable, the attendance was not large. Host Ferrier had a well stocked booth and did a brisk trade. ‘There were several drunken blacks, but no inebriated whites. By some disreputable means the former got drink and they were a great nuisance, especially one fellow known in the vicinity as Barney. He, proud of his prowess as a pugilist, could not be kept quiet until a plucky young Irishman, with equal skill and good humour, in two or three rounds gave him his quietus. The aborigines frightened one or two families in the town during the following night. Mr Ferrier had applied in Kooringa for the presence of a trooper, but, unfortunately, one could not be spared.’

The horse races were followed by footraces and jumping. [The results are printed.]

The Burra Mine. SAMA has published its annual report and balance sheet. In the half-year just closed the production reached 1,500 tons of 18% ore. The ore produced did not meet expenses by about £2,800, but rental income reduced this deficiency to less than £1,300. The costs included significant permanent work.

Captain Sanders reports that in the half-year 52,812 tons of haulage has been done, new exploratory work carried out, a 30 inch roll-crushing mill, a Moonta jigger and other dressing machinery has been erected. He remains confident of the future. The Directors have reverted to the old system of treating the ore, the new process known as the convex round bubbles having proved unsuccessful. [This is a reference to the Buddle Pits.] The company’s establishment comprises 328 men and boys.

A Flour Mill is finally to be erected at Burra. Mr John Roach, late of Penwortham has decided to commence operations immediately.

28 April 1874, page 5

Kooringa Flour Mill. Ten years ago the idea of a flour mill at Burra would have been thought ludicrous. Now Mt john Roach of Penwortham has completed the purchase of a site from the SAMA in a central position between Kooringa and Redruth-Aberdeen and apparently intends to start building at once, having already got some material carted to the spot.

Burra Institute. This institution’s committee are economical and are not needlessly expending any money on the exterior, as they intend doing all they can to make the interior as convenient and comfortable as possible.

‘They have finished in the south wing a new reading room, 24 ft x 13 ft and enlarged the library to correspond. It measures 24 ft x 16 ft. The rooms are 13 ft in height and are well ventilated, and are fitted and finished in an ornate style. The Committee purpose erecting the north wing to correspond with the south. The old lecture room, which is 34 ft x 20 ft, will be left to be used as an entrance-hall and small museum. At the back will be built a lecture-hall 50 ft long and 34 ft broad, and when the whole structure is completed it is believed it will be a commodious and convenient establishment. The Secretary, who has given £10 to the fund, is devoting his whole time and attention to the Institute without any fee, but hopes to be encouraged by the public. The Committee are energetic in their endeavours to raise the required sum, which is £250.’

Hallett. 12 May. The district has shared in the timely rains lately.

Professor Askull gave an entertainment on the 8th inst. At the Windygoleeche Hotel [sic]. He was fairly patronised and the performance of his dogs gave great amusement.

Mr P. Ferrier has retired as landlord of the hotel.

The school, which was started recently has collapsed – a regrettable event. A good master is sadly needed.

The nearest school is five miles away at Ulooloo.

Hallett. 14 May. A meeting has been held at Broad’s Hotel to discuss the desirability of petitioning for a District Council for the Hundred [of Hallett], instead of being annexed to the Hundred of Kingston [in the DC of Mt Bryan]. A memorial will be forwarded to the authorities, the local member will be asked for support and a committee has been formed to carry out these moves.

13 June 1874, page 7

Burra DC. 9 June. The Chairman has written to the Chief Secretary seeking a delay in the formation of the Mt Bryan DC until arrangements have been made for reconstituting the Burra District. The Council resolved that no further objections be made to the formation of the new district. The majority of the Council favoured the following arrangements:

South Ward with one councillor to remain unchanged

Kooringa Township to constitute one ward with one councillor

Outside portion of the old Kooringa ward to constitute a ward with one councillor

Redruth and Aberdeen, inside the boundary of the police district to constitute one ward with one councillor

The same outside the police district to constitute one ward with one councillor

Mr Gebhardt’s resignation as Councillor for North Ward was accepted.

Crs Killicoat and McCulloch are to retire by rotation.

The well near Mr Hutson’s is to be filled in by daymen.

22 June 1874, page 6

Kooringa Meeting of Ratepayers

A meeting of ratepayers was held at Banks’ Assembly Rooms in Kooringa on 17 June. Captain Killicoat as chairman of the Burra DC presided following a requisition signed by 30 ratepayers. Mr W.R. Ridgway said he had sketched a memorial a fortnight earlier when he heard the Council was in dispute with the Government over the North Ward. He withdrew this, as the matter has been settled. But it was said the Council had a lawsuit with the Government, which if true was very unwise. The ratepayers had a right to know how matters stood.

Captain Killicoat said that c. £143 had been deducted from the grant-in –aid by the Government for a period when the Council had barely existed, before they had time to make an assessment, and now a second contribution was demanded. The Council did not believe in paying this and had legal advice that the claim was illegal. Council had instructed their solicitors not to go to law, but to write a letter to the Government. The Government had offered a compromise, but they had rejected this. Way &amp; Symons were very strongly of the opinion that the Government had no right to deduct a police contribution from District Councils. Cr Lane read from the Police Act a clause, which he thought entitled the Government to levy the money. In any case they could levy it on the police district which would be all the same to the ratepayers and a 1d levy on the rate would raise the money. He thought it inexpedient to aggravate the Government.

With respect to the Council Wards Cr Lane thought the proposed arrangements unfair, particularly to Kooringa, which produced nearly half the rates. He proposed the wards remain as at present but giving Redruth one more councillor, thus:

Kooringa Ward two councillors

Redruth Ward two councillors

South Ward one councillor

Cr Warnes thought there was nothing in the Act allowing the District Council to spend money on police and Way &amp; Symons views ought to count more than Cr Lanes’. He objected to pay for a service from which he received no benefit. Only one other Council on the colony, that of Yankalilla, was in the same position.

Mr Ridgway said outside residents gained nothing from the police. Immunity from house breaking should be a benefit, but of six cases in the last 18 months not one had been solved.

Mr Dawson said the objects of the meeting were altogether unclear and he moved it adjourn for a week so that the objectives could be made clear to those coming a distance to attend.

The meeting resolved to attend to the matters brought before it.

The meeting then endorsed the decision of Council in agreeing to the separation of the North Ward.

Mr O. Harvey moved that the Council withdraw all proceedings against the Government.

The Chairman said that although Cr Lane had said the Council was at law with the Government, they were not.

After some discussion Mr Dawson moved that the matter be left to the Council and this was carried.

Mr Ridgway then proposed that the meeting endorse the view of Cr Lane as above on the representation of wards. Cr Warnes amended this to leave the matter as proposed by the Council.

Mr Dawson made a lengthy analysis of where the rates came from and how the money was expended. He concluded that Kooringa Ward got more than its share, Redruth got too little and the North and South Wards had been robbed.

Eventually the original motion was carried.

11 July 1874, page 6

Booborowie. 6 July. A meeting was held of about 15 farmers at Mr Skew’s [sic] on Saturday. Mr Spence presided and said he was so hemmed in by bad creeks that he could neither go to the scrub nor get his wheat to market. He felt that the farmers in the district would support a District Council in the Hundred of Ayers. Mt Thomas felt the conveners were to blames for calling a meeting without having anything to lay before them. Mr Novice complained that the Hundred of Baldry was unrepresented; not having been notified. Mr Spence said the next meeting would be advertised and in the interim he would prepare a petition. Mr Novice wondered if they could not repair the roads more cheaply themselves. Messrs Midwinter, Fitzgerald, Hastie, Threadgold and others also spoke.

The Government new cutting on Flagstaff Hill was left in nature in some patches. Much of the traffic to the north that previously went via Mount Bryan is now diverted to this road. This will make it almost impassable. Surely the Central Road Board could metal a steep hill.

The applications for commonage in Mannanarie, Pekina, Tarcowie, Yongala, Appila, Terowie and Whyte districts show that farmers are also turning to keeping sheep.

Inquest/Obituary.

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest at the Miners’ Arms at Kooringa on 17 July on the death of John Jeoffrey [sic] Pearce aged 16, the son of Jeffrey Pearce of Kooringa, carter. Deceased was driving a cart laden with stone in Kooringa on 16 July. As he put his hands on the shaft to get into the vehicle, he slipped and fell onto his back. The wheel of the vehicle, containing some 21⁄2 tons of stone, passed over his body. Despite this the deceased got up and returned to his nearby home. Mr Diplock of Copperhouse saw him get up after the wheel passed over him. He described the accident to his father and was attended by Dr Dashwood, who held out no hopes of his recovery. He died the following day. The verdict was ‘Accidental death’.

E.T. Howell writes from Georgetown re the northern mail conveyances.

The horses used are half-fed and often so leg weary that they can barely start the coach. The roads are such heavy going that a team of good horses would struggle to do a ten mile stage and yet these stages are 19-20 miles. The cruelty and delays are all blamed on the state of the roads, but that is well known and the contractors should be prepared to meet such difficulties. Drivers are also lacking in civility and offer no help either with finding accommodation for the passengers or their luggage.

Burra Buildings. A Wesleyan Chapel is in the course of construction at Redruth. At New Aberdeen Stewart’s Hotel is making rapid progress under the contractor Mr Sara, who is also building a steam flour mill for Mr J. Roach nearly opposite Mr Opie’s Hotel on a site bought from SAMA. Near the Telegraph Station a new Roman Catholic Church, to be named St Joseph’s, is nearing completion. A police station is being erected in Kooringa.

Burra DC. 21 July. Mr Rees MP writes re the main lines of road to be inserted in the schedule of the new Bill. The Council wants the road from Kapunda to Burra Railway Station and thence northwards via Mount Bryan, and the road from Kooringa to five miles beyond Baldina creek to be declared main roads. Way &amp; Symon write advising their opinion that the Government cannot collect a police rate from a police district. A memorial from ratepayers asked for road repairs near Prince’s Town [or Princess Town].

Mt Bryan East. 4 August. The season has been wet, but cold and crop growth has stalled until temperatures rise. The roads are in a dreadful state and yet some settlers still oppose a District Council. Most would welcome one. As the country is fenced travellers are increasingly confined to the appalling roads.

Inquest/Obituary.

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest on 5 August into the sudden death that morning of Robert Dell at the Aberdeen Hotel. He had arrived at the hotel on Monday night about 12 o’clock by coach from Pt Augusta and complained of having caught a violent cold through sleeping in a damp hut. On Tuesday he was still complaining and spitting blood, but was not supposed to be seriously ill. At 6 o’clock Wednesday morning he said he felt very bad and took some brandy and water, but could not eat. At 7 a.m. Dr Dashwood was sent for, but was not at home and at 8 o’clock deceased was found sitting on the sofa, dead. Dr Dashwood said he had known the man as a patient for about nine years and last saw him 18 months ago. He suffered from dropsy arising from a heart affection. He concluded that death was due to heart disease accelerated by congestion of the lungs and that was the verdict of the jury.

[In view of the above the death registration would seem to be in error: Robert Mark Dell died 5 August 1874 aged 63 at Caltowie, residence Caltowie.]

Terowie Railway Meeting. G. Faulkner presided recently at a meeting at the Terowie Hotel of farmers and other interested in the extension of the railway from Burra to Terowie. The Hon. H.E. Bright wrote promising his support in Parliament. The road from Hanson was in a deplorable state and especially past the bluff at Booborowie where for 100 yards it passed through a swamp. A memorial has been prepared asking for a railway to be surveyed to Terowie and for road works in the interim period. A railway to Terowie would tap traffic from the Barrier Ranges. Some thought the line should diverge at Hanson, but it was pointed out by others that the land between Hanson and Terowie was not settled, while between Burra and Terowie it was farmed.

The Burra-Hallett Road. A memorial has been received from 124 teamsters and settlers mentioning the impassable state of the Burra-Hallett road. They also pray that the contractors Kerby &amp; Wade, working on the road south of Mt Bryan Hotel not be allowed an extension of time, as labour was not scarce. The Commissioner of Public Works announced the provision in 1874-75 for £750 for the Saddleworth-Auburn road and £500 for repairs to the Stanley Flat to Bungaree and Anama road.

Mr M.H. Furniss was presented with an illuminated parchment at a meeting at Banks’ Hotel in Kooringa in recognition of his conduct over the last 15 years. Mr Furniss has long been employed by the SAMA as accountant at the Mine and while not active in public life, has in a quiet manner done much to further the interests of the townspeople as well as those of the company. He is leaving the district to reside in Adelaide. Some 40-50 friends attended the gathering, which was chaired by Mr W.H. Rosman.

Blinman. 17 August.

For some months the end of the journey from Adelaide has been at night and on several occasions in very bad weather. Despite darkness, rough weather and bad roads the mail coach and passengers have been brought safely through. The care skill and management of the driver, W.W. Morgan deserves praise. Now, with competition threatening it is reported that changes will be made in the coaching arrangements.

Captain J. White was presented with a gold watch on 31 August at a meeting of about 60 of his friends at the Primitive Methodist Schoolroom at Kooringa. It marked the severing of his association with the Burra Mine. Captain White said he did not intend to leave the district and yet hoped to see the Mine prove as rich and remunerative as it had ever been.

Mt Bryan East. 24 August. A large quantity of rain has fallen and this will aid farmers who are fallowing. A memorial has been prepared asking the Government to make a large water reserve at a place commonly known as The Troughs. It is the only permanent water in a long distance; ‘other permanent water being foolishly sold.’

Residents are wondering why it is taking the Government so long to reveal its decision on the formation or otherwise of a District Council.

A Trip Through the Northern Areas

I travelled by train to Saddleworth at a minimum speed of about 16 m.p.h. The road from the Saddleworth Station to the town was absolutely dangerous. The new road from Saddleworth to Auburn was lined with ruts about 3 ft deep and 1 ft wide into which men were throwing metal without draining off the water. Inattention to drainage is the secret of the defective state of this road. From Auburn to Clare the road is good and the feed abundant. There is not much cultivation and the little we saw seemed to want warmth. From Clare there are two options. One takes you via Rochester, Collingsfield, Redhill and Crystal Brook to Pt Pirie and the other reached the same place via Anama, Broughton, Gulnare, Georgetown, Narridy and Rocky River. For the former route the coach leaves Tuesdays and Fridays after the arrival of the coach from Saddleworth and stays overnight at Collingsfield, reaching Pt Pirie at about 2 p.m. the next day (30/-). On the latter route you leave at the same times and days via the Pt Augusta mail coach to Georgetown and then change to the cross country mail cart, which travels all night and arrives Pt Pirie at about 9 a.m. the next morning (35/-). The first route is recommended as the latter is very wearisome and dangerous at night.

From Clare to Bungaree the road has been metalled for some distance. At Bungaree the feed was magnificent and the landscape parklike. Bungaree has a pretty lodge and a fine entrance with a carriage drive to Mr Hawker’s house, behind which is a substantially built church. The road undulates through Bungaree Paddock and then crests the range with a mad scamper down to Rochester, bumping over stumps and boulders with passengers spending much of the time in the air to the detriment of their hats. Rochester is but a smithy and a store. Our coach was a kind of Hawker’s wagon that had seen better days and its canvas cover much torn by passing trees and its interior much bedaubed with mud. There were a few paddocks of good wheat about 16 miles north of Clare, but not many homesteads and the area did not look prosperous. The 18 miles or so from Rochester to Collingsfield is very flat and suited to agriculture. We saw several wild turkeys at dusk. At Collingsfield the accommodation was in a little pine hut divided into a kitchen and three bedrooms with plenty of holes in the walls and a chimney so ineffective that the doors had to be left open. Women are advised not to attempt the journey. The impudent get the few beds and the modest have the floor. The area has good looking crops of wheat.

Burra Improvements

A large number of improvements have recently been made at Aberdeen:

A new hotel close to the railway has just been completed and licensed. [Bon Accord Hotel.]

The roof is being put on Mr Roach’s flour mill.

Butterworth’s mill is going ahead fast and the boiler has arrived.

The National Bank has opened a branch and Mr Ridgway is building a new office for it. [This is the corner portion of the Royal Exchange Hotel in 2012.]

The Bank of Australasia has purchased land and is erecting a branch.

It is rumoured that Mr W.H. Williams will erect a brewery on the corner opposite Mr Tiver’s premises. [This did not eventuate.]

Changes to the North and North-East

Several loads of wool have arrived at Kooringa from Mt Gipps, Panramatty, Paratoo, etc. Carriers complain of the shortage of feed and the dryness of the season in the Northeast, but near Burra the season is good and the bad roads are the only drawback. But a damp season and bad roads is preferable to a dry season and good roads. A few years ago it was very difficult to get the wool clip to Port Adelaide in anything like proper time. Now with the railway reaching Burra and with a steam dumping press at the Redruth Station, the whole clip, even from the Barrier Ranges is got down in time to ship for the February sales in London.

14 September 1874, page 6

A Trip Through the Northern Areas

The road towards the Broughton from Collingsfield is like a wet ploughed field, but it has a hard bottom. [The writer describes a well cultivated landscape hereabouts.]

Though the crops looked very promising the houses of settlers were poor and miserably built with no attempts at gardens. The shelters for horses were very crude and agricultural implements were strewn all about. Fences were rough crooked posts with two wires strained through them. Do the farmers see themselves as merely temporary visitors in this landscape?

Between Broughton and Crystal Brook the agricultural country continues and it is largely flat with water courses lined with large trees. From Crystal Brook to Stony River is promising for agriculture. Stony River has a post office/store and a few houses. The gate of Bowman’s Paddock is reached about 12 miles from Pt Pirie. This is well grassed open country. Pt Pirie is a long irregular group of weatherboard houses along the bank of a salt creek, with jetties running into the stream at several points. Opposite is a thick mass of mangroves. Granted some good years and it will grow into a proper town with a mayor and Corporation by 1880. The main street now is about as soft as a load of silt. There are four commodious wheat stores with jetties and Magarey &amp; Co.’s new mill is an extensive establishment four storeys high and just started work. The National Bank has a branch and the telegraph wires have arrived, but as yet no instrument to work the service.

An accident. A few days ago Mrs Field brought in eggs and other farm produce to Mr Bath’s store and left the cart and two children in front of it. The horses moved on and overturned the cart. Though not hurt, the children were in a pretty mess with smashed eggs all about them.

Booborowie. 15 September. The petition calling for a district council also asks for the name of the place to be standardised to Booborowie rather than Booborowie, as that is closer to the native pronunciation. The Aborigines are fast dying out and the meaning of local place names should be recorded while it is still possible; the ‘owie’ section means water. ‘Boobor’ is large. Some other names are:

Minlacowie, Terowie, Yarrowie, Yarcowie, Canowie and Bimbowrie – probably a corruption of Bimberowie. ‘Can’ means small.

[Manning, Geoffrey H. 1990, Manning’s Place Names of South Australia, offers the following meanings:

Bimbowrie pine tree water

Booborowie round waterhole

Canowie from kanyaowie – rock waterhole

Minlacowie from either minala-kawi – two waters, or minla-kawi – fresh water well

Terowie hidden waterhole

Yarrowie [Now Appila] no origin cited

Yarcowie flood or great waters]

Survey of Lands East of Burra. SA Parliament.

Mr Rees moved that in view of the unemployment levels all the lands currently in the World’s End, Cowper’s, Barker’s and Hallett’s Runs be thrown open to selection. He said the land in question had been discussed before and the Government was opposed because the land was outside Goyder’s Line of Rainfall. Recently the Treasurer had said he had no objection to throwing open the land, but he predicted if people took it they would be ruined. Rees thought his constituents would take the risk and the Government had no right to dictate what they were able to do in that regard. He pointed out how wrong earlier prognostications had been about the land around Burra and Mt Bryan. The squatters said the land was sterile and they had lost money there. The Government would be doing them a favour in resuming it if that were the case.

[Rees then cited a number of wonderful results from experimental plantings on land beyond Goyder’s Line, but contiguous with that already released. Mr Pearce seconded the motion and spoke in support. He said it was necessary to open as much land as was suitable for growing wheat between Kapunda, Burra and the Murray Flats. The land in question was suitable when there were easterly rains.

The Chief Secretary, Hon. A. Blyth said there was never a time in the history of the colony when there were so few unemployed. The survey would be illegal as the lands were not included in the Bill. He hoped the hon. Members would support the Government in abolishing the line of rainfall.

26 September 1874, page 6

A Trip Through the Northern Areas

[The writer describes rather discursively the road from Caltowie to Jamestown; being bothered on the way by the impact of new fencing, which sometimes caused diversions or even blocked the way.]

Jamestown is the most easterly town of what may be called the Pt Pirie group and yet it is not entirely of that group; its mail comes via Burra as do many of its supplies. I was wakened at a rather too early hour at Jamestown by the steam whistle of the busy flour mill. The township has an abnormally wide main street, which gives an undeservedly desultory appearance to the town; an appearance that should change when the impending District Council is instituted. Otherwise Jamestown pleased me better than the other two towns I had seen since leaving Clare, and if I am not mistaken it has a prosperous future. At present it has two hotels, stores and duplicate saddlers, butchers, bootmakers, etc. It has also a well-qualified medical practitioner and insurance agents. The site seems to me to be rather too flat and a range of nearby low hills would have been a better location. Surveyors are busy cutting the original 40-acres ‘suburban’ blocks into allotments of 10 and 11 acres. [The writer digresses then for some time to discuss the uselessness of 10-11 acre blocks.]

A block of land a few miles south of Jamestown has been selected by the Government for a forestry reserve.

[From Jamestown the writer went to Laura and thence returned to Pt Pirie, during which he came across the unexciting signs of the initial work for the Pt Pirie-Gladstone railway; a few miles of earthwork at present beginning nowhere and ending in nothing. He had more respect for ‘the Dam’ that was to serve Pt Pirie.]

[Continued 28 September.]

28 September 1874, page 6

A Trip Through the Northern Areas

[The writer describes the journey from Pt Pirie to Georgetown in a spring-cart as being extremely uncomfortable; ‘one is reminded of a tightly packed slave boat in a very heavy sea’.]

It is a pity that more attention is not being paid to roads in the area. They are virtually impassable to ordinary teams. [He then goes on to specify particularly bad spots along the roads.]

‘Fancy the whole of the country between Bungaree and Port Pirie in the hands of two sheepfarmers; about three years’ possession would make a modest man rich. Now there are hundreds of homesteads – such as they are – thousands of hands profitably employed, and scenes of bustling life and activity where but yesterday, comparatively speaking, the silence was only broken by the solitary shepherd’s call to his dog or the bleating of sheep among the luscious pastures.’

‘The great drawback to the present state of affairs seems to me to be the fact that nearly all the new settlers in the area are not new settlers in the country; they are merely families who have left holdings which they have exhausted in the older districts, and not as one could wish they were, new comers from home.’

[He then goes on to speculate about what this could mean for the old areas in the future and indeed for the new areas as they in turn become exhausted.]

The absence of good timber for fencing etc. in the area is a drawback. Despite the poor appearance of housing, the settlers must be more affluent than they appear because a party of travelling photographers told me they had taken £60 in ten days and another photographer reported taking over £100 in less than a month.

On the Pt Pirie side of Narridy the crops are magnificent. Narridy township has a large and comfortable hotel, built of stone, a blacksmith’s and a good-sized mill, but the town does not seem to be growing very fast. From there to Georgetown the land was well cultivated and full of wheat. [He then enters into another discussion of the poor roads and the need for improvements.]

Georgetown is a thriving place with a lot of new building. There may be 150 houses, some very pretentious stores, a Catholic Chapel and a Baptist Church in the course of erection. It is, however, almost the muddiest place in the world.

[The author then describes his return to Clare by coach; a difficult and uncomfortable journey over execrable roads in heavy rain, involving walking uphill in pouring rain.]

A Trip Through the Northern Areas

[The writer waffles on for half a column before saying much of note. He then describes what he saw on an after dinner stroll in the moonlight.]

A three storey mill of a calibre not seen out of Adelaide appeared. Even in the bright moonlight it wasn’t easy walking over holes three feet deep. Looking around it was possible to see development which private capital has effected worth thousands of pounds, but the Government has as yet done positively nothing. Since I was there I believe 30 men have made a start on Ellen Street, but I fear it could have used two or three hundred.

[He then goes on about the great deal of grain grown in the north and the total lack of Government capital in railways and little more in roads. He then carries on a discursive discussion on the need for infrastructure including the extension of the telegraph system. The absence of proper police stations and their attendant facilities is also dealt with.

[Continued 5 October.]

The Season. This year has been excellent, but we wonder that more farmers do not produce hay. Much of it is required and last season it had to be imported into the district, even from Kapunda and at prices as high as in Adelaide.

2 October 1874, page 5

Mt Bryan. A gentleman with many teams reports that there is nowhere in the colony with one quarter the traffic that uses the Burra-Mt Bryan Road, that is half as bad as that road. The road is decorated with broken wagons, and wool that has been unloaded and left by the roadside. Teamsters never think of travelling in less that five or six together; all the leading horses are attached to each wagon separately and even then the vehicle often gets stuck in the mud. One day a teamster got his axle so far down in the newly-formed road that it was dragging the metal forward. Even when unloaded, it took 16 bullocks to extricate the empty wagon.

3 October 1874, page 6

The Mt Bryan Road. 2 October. A Deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works, Hon. H.E. Bright MP.

Mr P. Waite stated that the Mt Bryan Road was in a very bad state and there were this year some 12,000 to 14,000 bales of wool to come down it.

Mr Killicoat reported driving down it with Mr Dawson a day or two ago and saw six bullocks drawing four bales of wool and six horses 9-13 bales. Almost every half mile the teamsters had to unload and beside the bales of wool there were stacks of flour, bran and pollard and all manner of merchandise bound for Jamestown and other places. ‘Their lives were in danger from the time they left the Burra until they arrived at Mt Bryan Station. In one place the road was fenced off for two miles because of the state of the road, and the traffic had to turn to the right and the left, and it was scarcely possible to cross Holman’s Creek. They managed to get back to the Burra with only one broken spring. The road was the most dangerous and treacherous that he had ever seen in South Australia.’

He asked for a special grant.

Mr Dawson corroborated Mr Killicoat’s observations, but added that he had forgotten to mention the approach to the Burra Station. ‘Within a quarter mile of the station there was a hole large enough to cover a spring-dray. Five miles from the Burra the road was fenced off to save people’s lives and there were men there to forcibly prevent persons passing.’

‘When he was on the road the other day he saw 60 or 70 teams travelling six and seven together.’

Mr Drew said that about 300 teams were employed on the road.

Mr Hill said his firm had taken their teams off the road because they could not get along. About 2,500 tons had been carted over the road in the last two months and about 1,000 tons were at the Burra Station waiting to go up. Several teams had been eight days on the road from Mt Bryan to Burra, and the drivers refused to go back.

Mr S. Davenport travelled the road on Tuesday and confirmed the above. For 12 miles travel was impossible except on horseback or with a well-horsed mail and it was only with great difficulty that the mail got through. He thought some of the slag from the smelting works could be used to fill the holes.

Mr A.S. Clark said that at the present time £150,000 worth of wool was detained on the other side of the road and 1,000 tons of goods worth between £20,000 and £30,000 was waiting to be taken north to Jamestown etc. Many of the teamsters were farmers who would soon leave to undertake their harvest, leaving the traffic stranded. Ships were waiting at the port and graziers’ wool would miss the sales as a consequence. Providence was promising a bumper harvest, which would contribute more traffic. Thousands of tons of wheat would need to use the road.

Hon. J. Crozier supported immediate action. They did not blame the present Government, but came to them as the only source of remedy.

Mr Acraman said he represented the interests of settlers in other colonies doing business through this one. The owners of Mt Gipps Station in NSW had their traffic through SA and paid £1,800 a year to the Government and the teamsters, sending down all their clip and taking back stores. He understood this section of road had taken more time than all the rest of the journey. They were 90 miles from the Darling and very little might cause them to send their business via Echuca.

Mr Dawson said there was a quantity of mining equipment presently in Burra that ought to be moving over the road.

Mr Bright in reply said he had never before heard of a case of such magnitude as this. He had been making inquiries before they arrived and had been informed of wool taken down and thrown into the mud on the side of the road because of the state of the road. He was in a difficult position as it was a main road under the Central Board, over which he had no control, but he undertook to discuss the matter with the Chairman of that Board and to impress upon him the urgency of the case. The Board had the money to act. If the result of the discussion was unsatisfactory, he would take the matter up with his colleagues and was sure he would have the support of the

Attorney-General, who was one of the members for the district.

5 October 1874, page 6

A Trip Through the Northern Areas

Georgetown and Gulnare. Narridy to Georgetown is an area of splendid wheat crops. Locally Georgetown is regarded as the capital of the north. The town itself is not exciting. The main street boasts one hotel, four or five general stores, saddlers, shoemakers, blacksmiths etc. One establishment that places the town a cut above the average is the Italian Warehouse. [In a meandering comment of a dozen lines the writer reveals this to be a pharmacist; of some importance in an area without medical practitioners. He does not know why it is called by the title mentioned.]

Accommodation for travellers is at present atrocious, but will be remedied by a public house now under construction. Georgetown is unusual in SA in not having a Wesleyan, Bible Christian, Primitive Methodist or Methodist New Connexion Chapel. The biggest church is Roman Catholic and there is a resident priest. The Baptists have regular services in a large galvanized iron wheat store lent by Messrs Mitchell, Fox &amp; Co., but are building a chapel. This is unusually shaped as an octagon, looking something like a cross between a summer-house and a tea-garden rotunda. But what is carried on inside is of more importance than the external appearance. Anglicans are not numerous, but lay readers hold regular services in a private house.

I have so far avoided reference to Georgetown’s mud, but it is not possible to convey the quality and quantity of that commodity. One young man told me that it was more than a month since he has been able to cross a chain and a half street there ‘to procure the mild solace of a glass of ale!’ Despite money being voted for improvements and a visit by an emissary from the Central Road Board, nothing has actually been done. The area is very prosperous with returns of 12-18 bushels to the acre and last year the colony’s average was under 8. The year before that the Georgetown area managed 25 to 30 bushels per acre. As a change from crops I was driven south to the well-known Bundaleer Station. Crops now come almost to the door of the self-contained and well-appointed head station. The place was busy with shearers. In addition to the sheep breeding, the owner seems intent upon making Bundaleer a centre for horse breeding.

Gulnare is the home mainly of Scots and Irish with a few English.

[Continued 12 October.]

The Mt Bryan Road

A special meeting of the central Road Board was held on Tuesday to consider the steps needed to place the Mt Bryan Road in repair, following the recent deputation. The Chairman pointed out that the Commissioner of Public Works was unable to act because the road was on the schedule of main roads with control vested in the Board. The only funds readily available were £750 from the contingent fund. The work was urgent with holes in the road large enough to take a dray in bodily. The condition of the road was holding up the shipment of 12,000 bales of wool, many tons of which had been thrown off drays and exposed to the weather. 2,000 or 3,000 tons of merchandise were also delayed going north from Burra. After discussion it was decided to spend the £750 in the contingent fund and to point out to the Government that they would then have no funds to cover any contingency that might arise. Mr Bright, the Commissioner for Public Works thanked the Board for its prompt action and undertook to consider carefully any request for funds should a contingency arise, being sure they would not ask for such unless it was absolutely necessary.

9 October 1874, page 3

The Mt Bryan Road. One unmentioned aspect of the problem with the road is that many farmers become teamsters to earn the money wherewith to get in their harvest. This year many have actually lost money because of the state of the road. It has cost them the time and labour of themselves and of their teams as well as damage.

Accident. Charles McDonald, manager of Outalpa Station for Messrs Dufflied, Harrold &amp; Hurd, was knocked over by a horse on 11 October. When he was still unconscious at 11 p.m. a messenger was despatched for a doctor at Burra, 180 miles away. He did not reach Burra until 6.30 a.m. Tuesday. Another messenger, who departed at 9 a.m. Monday brought news that Mr McDonald was conscious briefly and then relapsed into torpor. Dr A. Cave has set out to see the patient.

SA Mining Association

The report for the half year to 30 September 1874 shows the yield from the Burra Mine was 1529 tons 2 cwt 3 qrs for the half year, compared with 1514 tons 4 cwt 2 qrs for the preceding half year. This is disappointing. The value of the March quarter’s copper was £6,081 less than the cost of raising it, reduced to £4,103 after allowing for rents etc. The loss for the last half was £2,162. In the six months £24,349 was spent in wages and acquiring plant, stores etc. and 1,530 tons of ore was sold to the E &amp; A Copper Co.

Captain Sanders reports on various economies achieved in this period and cost cutting in management. The workforce has been reduced by 88 hands. Economical machinery has been erected.

At 30 September they were employing 233 men and boys and 5 officers.

‘In conclusion the Directors state that although they have reduced the expenditure to the lowest possible point, there is better prospect of obtaining profit in the future without the assistance of a much larger capital to prosecute deep workings that they can expect to command. They have therefore communicated with the London Board of Advice to ascertain their view as to the propriety of either letting the property or submitting it for sale and winding up the association. An answer is expected by the next or following mail, when an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders will be called to take such steps as the nature of the reply may render necessary. It cannot fail to excite general regret that the once flourishing Burra Burra should have sunk into so unsatisfactory a position.

[Note that the sense of the above paragraph would seem to require it to read ‘there is no better prospect’ etc. rather than the positive statement actually printed.]

St Mary’s, Burra. The Bishop of Adelaide held a service at St Mary’s on Sunday morning when 20 were confirmed. Many more candidates had been prepared, but were prevented from attending due to being ill with measles, which is very prevalent at present. Few families have escaped and adults as well as children are being attacked. He preached at Kooringa in the morning, at the Redruth Schoolroom in the afternoon and again at Kooringa in the evening.

The Governor had been expected to arrive at Farrell’s Flat by special train on Monday, but his sudden bereavement meant he cancelled the trip and the train ran only as far as Riverton.

[The daughter of Sir Anthony Musgrave, Joyce Harriet Musgrave, died 11 October 1874 at Adelaide aged 3.]

Wool is now arriving at the railway station as the roads dry out. Nearly 500 bales arrived on Saturday. It is expected the road from Aberdeen to the railway station will be macadamised about this time next year if the Central Road Board proceeds at its usual rate.

Burra Institute. The alterations and extensions have begun. Mr Rowland Rees MP drew up the plans and the contract has been won by Messrs Pearce.

23 October 1874, page 7

Kooringa Wesleyan Church held Anniversary services on Sunday when Rev. J. Nicholson from Clarendon was the preacher. The tea meeting on Monday was poorly attended, with numbers reduced by wet weather and the outbreak of measles and scarlatina prevalent in almost every household. The debt is under £400 and the last year’s expenditure was well under the income. Revs. Nicholson and Stockdale spoke at the meeting. The latter is the newly appointed additional minister for the northern part of the Burra Circuit.

Burra Mine. Ore Dressing Machinery.

Captain Sanders, the manager of the Mine has for some time devoted much attention to the economical separation of the ore from its attendant waste. G.R. Lowe tells us that the Burra ores are acknowledged to be some of the most difficult to separate in the world. Their respective gravities being nearly alike, they have been quite impossible to separate by mechanical means. Captain Sanders has now devised a jigger that has been in operation for about six weeks with markedly successful results. This follows a small model he trialled six months ago. It is what is known in the field as a piston continuous jigger and once started and properly supplied with ‘stuff’ it is not necessary to stop it for adjustments. Such jiggers are divided into two or more compartments to classify the ores as they leave the sieves. Generally these divisions each have a piston, this appliance, however, has only one piston; which acts on the various compartment simultaneously. The second and third compartments are fitted with an adjustable sheet iron slide between the piston and the sieve, and which regulates the action of the piston thereon. The piston and sieve are each 11 ft long, the latter being 2 ft 9 inches wide. The piston is worked from overhead, an adjustable crank being fixed at each end of a strong shaft, to which is fitted a heavy flywheel to ensure regularity of action. The tail end of the jigger is fitted with a skimming box, into which the waste is deposited as it leaves the sieve. This is capable of holding about a ton of stuff. By having a skimming box attached in this manner it allows the sieve to be submerged to a considerable depth in the water, and in practice it is found that a very important point is gained; for by this mode much less fine ore is discharged with the waste, as the stream of water required to be constantly running over the length of the sieve has not such a disturbing influence on the fine ore as in the older methods of treatment.

[The description continues with considerably more details.]

The jigger has been erected to receive the stuff from ten head of stamps, and to replace one known as a Moonta jigger, which was found to be unsuited to the class of ores obtained at Burra, the fine stuff from the stamps completely choking it and making no separation of ores from the waste. The new jigger will handle four tons of stuff per hour. Captain Sanders has taken no steps to protect his invention, saying he would gladly see anything done to effect a saving in mining operations. On going through the mine I was much impressed with a new and powerful crushing mill, which I am informed, puts through about 70 tons of stuff per day. The ores from this are put through to the floors the same day, the waste going to the stamps and through the jigger as before mentioned, being thus made ready for the market; in fact the whole of the stuff raised in the mine during the day being treated, all the ore that it is possible to extract from it by mechanical means is taken out, and is ready for the market in the evening.

Aberdeen. 29 October. Buildings are going up rapidly. James Tiver has just commenced the erection of a pretty shop and dwelling. Mr Ridgway has let a contract to Sara Bros. for a house and offices. The latter will be occupied by the National Bank. This building, designed by Mr Rowland Rees MP, will add to the beauty of the place. The prospects are for a very good season for wheat and it is expected the two new flour mills will have plenty to do. Mr Roach’s mill is a very neat structure and has been almost completed by Sara Bros. Mr Rees was also the architect for this. Mr Roach has already laid in a large stack of firewood. Butterworth’s mill is also nearing completion, and the machinery is being fixed.

Locusts have appeared, but they are very small and it is thought that the crops will be too advanced to be much damaged before they are able to do much harm.

Measles are still prevalent and it is common for four or five to be afflicted in the one family. Fortunately few cases have terminated fatally.

Booborowie. 28 October. With cool weather after the heat measles have started anew. A record area has been sown to wheat. Contamination with wild oats is a problem. The time when country folk fear fires is approaching ‘as thousands of pounds worth of property may be sacrificed owing to fires caused by the accursed tandstickors.’

Northern Crops. Crops north of Burra in the areas of Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett are looking splendid. Grass on Booborowie Run and other pastoral holdings is also good and the sheep are in fine condition.

Riverton. The Government refreshment room at the Riverton Station has now been completed and awaits only a tenant. The building is handsome with bow windows and will doubtless be a great convenience.

Mt Bryan Road. Following the deputation of 2 October and the subsequent decision by the Central Road Board to spend the whole of the Northern contingent fund on the Mt Bryan Road, great promptness has been shown by the authorities. Mr Morris the Superintending Surveyor of the Northern District has also acted promptly and the road is now in splendid condition and has carried all the traffic that was detained owing to its state of disrepair.

The Forrest Exploring Expedition

Mr John Forrest attended the cricket match at Farrell’s Flat on Saturday and then visited the Burra Mines, where an address was presented to him, congratulating him on his safe arrival after his long, arduous and successful expedition of exploration. Mr Forrest and his party left Burra for Salisbury on Monday morning by the first train. [His receptions at Jamestown, Gawler and Salisbury are reported at length.]

Burra 30 October: Mr Forrest at Kooringa.

Mr Forrest arrived at about 3 p.m., having travelled from Canowie since the morning. Once his arrival was known, he received a warm reception. A complimentary dinner was organised in Mr Lamb’s Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms, attended by 50 or 60 people. Mr Philip Lane, Chairman of the Burra DC presided. The exploring party comprised Mr John Forrest, his brother Mr Alexander Forrest, third officer Trooper Kennedy, farrier Mr Sweeney, and two West Australian blackfellows, including Jimmy Winditch,* who accompanied Mr Forrest on his previous visit to SA. Mr Harry Gosse, who has accompanied the expedition a considerable distance, was also present. J.D. Cave JP read an address of welcome [a paragraph of which is printed]. W.H. Rosman, Manager of the National Bank, proposed a toast congratulating the expedition on their 2,000 mile trek in six months. Mr Forrest responded. Other toasts and speeches were made by Alexander Forrest, Pierre (one of the blackfellows, who made an intelligent speech of about five minutes and provoked much laughter), H. Dawson and Harry Gosse.

[* In another part of the report he is called Tommy Windich, but this may be confusing him with Tommy Pierre, who is also named elsewhere in the article. Winditch/Windich is said to be a splendid bushman and an expert at finding water. He also had a good knowledge of the situation and characteristics of the other colonies and remembered well details of his earlier visit to SA. He had an intelligent expression and was a mine of information on his native colony. Pierre was literate and had a good deal of knowledge on a range of topics, but had a somewhat confused notion of colonial affairs.]

[There are reports on 31 October and 2 November of Forrest’s arrival at Canowie, Jamestown and Kooringa (page 5 in each case)and a very extensive report on his reception in Adelaide and on the expedition generally in the paper of 4 November, page 5.]

The Annual Kooringa Masonic Ball was held in Lamb’s Burra Hotel on Thursday. Schrader’s Band provided good music and there were capital refreshments. The only drawback was the lack of attendance, particularly of ladies. This was easily accounted for by the presence of measles in nearly every house in the neighbourhood.

The Wool Clip has almost been cleared. More than two thirds has been forwarded, with over 10,000 bales sent from the Burra Station to Saturday last. Fewer than 500 bales are left north of Gottlieb’s Wells.

Redruth Court, 6 November.

This case ran from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and created great interest.

On 9 June Mr Keilor was returning to his home from Burra in a German wagon, when he was stopped and robbed of 32/- about two miles from the Mule Camp on The Emu Flat Road. He was struck on the head and according to his statement lay on the road for some time. On partially recovering he wet to two houses to enquire the way, but was taken to be intoxicated. He did not get home till the following morning, although the driverless horses returned home about 9 p.m. He told others he had been robbed by two Englishmen in two wagons, with a yellow dog. He and his wife decided not to institute proceedings, but to see if a second attempt would be made. They went to Burra together on the 17 June and on the way home a man got into their wagon at about the same place as the robbery had occurred. When the woman screamed and Keilor raised his whip, the intruder escaped. Keilor was satisfied that the man was Fogarty and, an information having been laid, Fogarty was duly arrested and locked up. After appearing before a magistrate Fogarty was charged with the robbery of 9 June and the attempted one of the 17 June.

After Keilor’s evidence had been partly heard the case was adjourned and Fogarty released on bail while he sought legal advice and witnesses. When the case was resumed the case was dismissed by the Magistrate.

The case on 6 November was brought by Fogarty alleging injury due to wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. He claimed £100 damages. Mrs Murphy gave evidence that on 9 June Fogarty had driven a spring cart with her, to his own home at about 6 p.m. Evidence of Keilor’s actions after the first robbery was given by James Parker and his wife (Caroline), George Hare and James Warren. John G. Heinrich testified to having travelled with Keilor as far as Sod Hut Inn, where they each had two glasses of beer, and afterwards till their roads diverged. He said Keilor was perfectly sober then. Keilor and his wife gave the same evidence as at the former trial.

The magistrate ordered a nonsuit, with each party to pay his own costs.

Inquest/Obituary

An inquest was held on 10 November by J.D. Cave JP at the Smelters’ Home Hotel on the death of Mr Joseph Morris, jeweller, of Adelaide, who had been found suspended by a handkerchief from the top of a bed in the hotel at 1.30 p.m. the same day.

Edward Francis Opie said he had seen deceased at Wildongoleeche 7 p.m. the previous evening in Mr Terry’s Pt Augusta mail coach. Saw him again at the Smelters’ Arms when he was going to bed. As I left I asked if he was leaving by the morning train and he said not till the afternoon train. This morning my brother knocked at his door and at 1.00 p.m. I knocked and asked if he was getting up. I tried the window, but it was bolted. There were two policemen in the house and I asked them to break down the door. Deceased was hanging by the neck from the top of the bedstead.

Mr Nicholas Opie testified to deceased’s arrival at the hotel by Terry’s coach about 10.30 p.m. He arranged for a bed and then the coach drove on to the Post Office. Morris returned a quarter of an hour later. Showed him to his room, where he was talking to my brother when I left. Knocked on his door for breakfast, but did not see him in the morning. Knocked again at about 1 p.m. and got no reply. Tried to look through the keyhole, but the key was in the lock. Told my brother I thought something was wrong and we agreed to call for the police. Policeman Farrell broke open the door. Deceased was sober last night and took no refreshments as far as I know. Deceased was hanging from the bedstead. He brought in his luggage and left his boots out to be cleaned.

Constable Farrell said he had seen the deceased outside the hotel the night before. He told of breaking down the door and discovering the deceased. Deceased’s feet were about two inches from the ground and his right hand was grasping the headrail of the bedstead. Left Constable Howard in charge and reported the death to Dr Dashwood who was outside.

Constable Howard gave corroborative evidence and said he had found in deceased’s clothes one £10 note, one £5 note and five £1 notes in his pocket book also 8/4 in coins, keys a memorandum book and two letters. There was a small bag of rings in his coat pocket and two boxes which Howard had not opened, but assumed contained jewellery.

William E. Dashwood said he had known the deceased for several years and believed him to be of sound health. He seemed to be of active habits and cheerful. Last saw him alive 5 November, when he appeared as usual. There was no appearance of a struggle and from the look of the bed he had not lain down. From the degree of rigor mortis he appeared to have been dead at least 12 hours. The cause of death was strangulation from a handkerchief being tied to the top rail of the bedstead with a noose placed around the deceased’s neck. It was quite possible for the deceased to have tied the noose himself.

Hermann Mosarr, jeweller, residing at Aberdeen said he had known the deceased for two years and had seen him in Aberdeen on Tuesday 3 November. Morris had told him he had been doing little business and at the time when he should have been doing his best trade, he had been taken ill and had had to spend two weeks in Adelaide. He was heading north to see if he could do more, having done but little trade in Burra. He appeared downhearted. He had said he was going to Laura. He generally stayed away two or three weeks, but had returned after only a few days.

The coroner remarked that, although in this case it would have made no difference, in general a body should be cut down as soon as possible, as a minute or two can be the difference between life and death.

[This death does not appear in the CD, SA Deaths 1842-1915. The evidence of the Register 13 November 1874 and of BISA suggests he was Moses Joseph Morris born 1838 in UK and who came to SA with his father Harris Morris in 1853.]

The Morris Suicide. The body of the young man Joseph Morris reached Adelaide by the midday train on Thursday. The cortege at once proceeded to the West Terrace Cemetery. Much sympathy is felt for the friends of the deceased who are respected members of the Jewish community. The father has form many years carried on business as an optician in Adelaide, and the deceased, the second son, has been acting as traveller for his father.

Fire broke out in Captain Killicoat’s paddock yesterday (15 November). Mr P.L. Killicoat and two of his workmen were almost immediately on the scene. A number of others from Redruth came to assist. The cause has not been identified.

Burra Quadrille Class had their closing party for the season on Thursday night. The class meets twice a month in winter at the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms. Dancing continues for four hours with a break for sandwiches and coffee. A subscription of £1-1-0 allows a gentleman to introduce two ladies. The fees pay for the hall and the music and, as there was a surplus, Schrafer’s Band from Adelaide was engaged for a ball and supper. About 30 couples attended.

Obituary/Inquest

On 21 November at Aberdeen an inquest was held into the death of Thomas O’Loghlin, who had died in a tent at Middle Camp the previous day.

Timothy O’Loghlin, brother of the deceased, said he had been working with his brother for about a week. His brother had then been away at Mt Bryan Hotel for four days and returned with a bottle of gin. The witness gave his evidence in an incoherent manner and at this point fainted or had a fit.

Owen Cronin, a labourer of Middle Camp, said he had been working with the deceased. He told of drinking with the deceased at the Mt Bryan Hotel and of returning with him. He said deceased had brought a bottle of gin with him. About 1 p.m. on Friday he had gone from O’Loghlin’s tent to his own and at 2 or 3 p.m. Timothy O’Loghlin had informed him of his brother’s death. He then went with Tom Moroney and the cook and saw deceased lying on his side in the bunk, dead. There had been no quarrel and he had heard no angry words.

‘Was at the Burra on Tuesday, and rode in a spring-cart to Mount Bryan, but do not know if the deceased was with us.’

Thomas Moroney, stone-cutter of Middle Camp:

Deceased had been working with me. Saw him at Mt Bryan Hotel on Thursday in good health. He took a bottle of square gin away. He was then apparently sober. At about 10 p.m. had a drink with him in his tent. Deceased then seemed healthy and sober. On Friday morning about 6 or 7 a.m. saw him at the door of his tent on his hands and knees with his back bent up. I and his brother put him in his bed, alive, but breathing heavily. Stayed an hour and then went to my own camp. Only thought he was like I had seen him many times before. His brother came to my tent about 2 p.m. and deceased was then dead and stiff. Deceased was in the habit of drinking. When I called at 10 o’clock Timothy O’Loghlin was not sober. Do not believe there is the least suspicion of foul play.

Patrick Gillespie, clerk to Mr Terry, mail contractor told how he had driven the deceased, his brother and Owen Cronin and a man called Barry, from the Court House Hotel to Middle Camp. They had drunk heavily on the way and the deceased had been very drunk. On the way Timothy O’Loghlin had informed him that he had come in to take his brother out, as he was on a spree.

Constable Farrell gave evidence of going to see the body.

The verdict was ‘That the deceased had been drinking heavily for some time past, and that death was caused by excessive drinking.

The Burra correspondent of the paper commented on a recent comment in the Register that there were many drunken men to be seen about the townships of Burra.

‘The high wages now being earned unhappily in many cases only lead to foolish workmen having more money to spend, to more time being occupied in the spending of it, and to less work being done in consequence.’

The rest of the correspondent’s comments concerned the police. The constable had to seek special permission to go to Middle Camp because of the understaffing of the Burra police. The Burra police arrangements have been in a chronic state of chaos for some time and are the subject of a constant battle between the Government and the Burra Council. There is a police station at Kooringa and one at Redruth. Half the cost of the Kooringa constable is met by the Council and he is confined to keeping order in the town. At Redruth there is a mounted constable and a foot constable. Until recently the duties of the latter have been multifarious. Half his cost is also charged to the Council and he has a horse provided. This means that he has at times undertaken duties that should be assigned to the mounted constable. This has resulted in the Council saying that if that is the case then his salary should be charged to general revenue. After a long delay the Government has limited his duties to the townships. This resulted in a second trooper being stationed at Redruth, but just when his services were needed, he had been removed without a replacement. Comparisons with other places, like Clare, where no local contribution is called for, suggest the Government has been very rough on the Burra Council.

[Thomas O’Loghlin died 20 November 1874 at Mt Bryan Flat aged 50.]

Robert Palmer writes from Saddleworth 20 November on Farming in the Northern Areas derived from a trip northwards from Clare.

The first 20 miles take you through the magnificent estate of Mr G.C. Hawker. The roads have carefully been laid out to avoid cutting up that property. The next 10-12 miles is open grassy plain; ideal for agriculture, but so far a mere sheep run, being still reserved for the squatter. Beyond lies the Broughton country where cultivation is extending on the finely grassed plains and hills. 10 bushels per acre will be realised. Redhill is reached in 35 miles. The Crystal Brook country has splendid grass and timber and will give good returns when cultivated. Reaping has commenced and the samples are very fair. Beyond are some miles of grassy plains, fit for agriculture, but I suspect the Government is reluctant to expel the squatters. A few miles of scrubby country brings the traveller to Port Pirie with its nine jetties, two public houses, two banks, half a dozen stores, a large mill and its choking dust. On leaving the port the next morning we passed through a grassy plain of 12-15 miles with fine soil fit for anything, but presently unused except by a few sheep. Hughes Gap brought us to rolling hills and fertile flats, much like the lands of Greenock and Tanunda, with timber for fencing etc. and yet it has not been opened up. Onwards we went to the open rolling plains towards Laura and Gladstone and Georgetown where crops topped the fence and yields of 25-30 bushels per acre seemed likely. From Laura, with its air of prosperity, we went down to Gladstone where we noticed the splendid property of H.B. Hughes. Gladstone is a thriving village with a mill, public house, etc. The next day we passed through land worth 15-20 bushels per acre, crossed the upper Broughton and re-entered the property of Mr Hawker, which extends in this direction 15 or 16 miles.

An Entertainment, presided over by Mr Rees MP, was held at the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms 24 November in aid of the Burra Institute Building Fund. Mr Rees said the cost of alterations and additions to the Institute would cost about £1,300 of which about £1,000 had been raised by subscription and the Government grant, leaving £300 still to be got. He felt sure the committee would be pleased by the night’s contribution. About 300 people attended. After the items dancing was conducted for nearly two hours.

Mt Bryan East. The crops are ripening and barley harvest is near. Hay is being cut. Locusts are thick on the ground and are making havoc with the green herbage and grass. On hot days many are on the wing.

Farming in the North

The rapid expansion of settlement in Northern Areas demands attention from more points of view than that of the mere tourist who describes in glowing terms the broad acres of smiling grain and the success of the efforts already made to bring these areas under cultivation. The whole experiment is fraught with uncertainty, depending as it does on the vagaries of the season and on the manner in which the large tracts of land are taken up and utilized. Will selectors work out the land by getting as much out of it as they possibly can, or will a better system be evolved with the improvements that may be possible with larger holdings? It is to be hoped that the latter will be realized and that we do not see in ten or twelve years’ time a repetition of the migration which has been going on with respect to some of the earliest settled areas of the colony. In some cases this is no doubt due to the smallness of the holdings as much as to the farmers’ improvidence. The new areas indeed offer some opportunities for a system of rational husbandry seldom achieved under the old system. The use of fallow in alternate years and the running of sheep upon the fallows are being tried. We believe the benefits are great enough to justify our urging it upon the landowners. This approach will preserve the land from exhaustion as well as providing work for labourers all year round. [The benefits of the plan are then developed upon and the beneficial effects upon employment discussed and the growing of lucerne or artificial grasses is urged..]

More than one enterprising sheep farmer has entered upon wheat growing on a considerable scale, mainly in consequence of the enhanced sheep carrying capacity of the land after it has been broken up and cropped and then in the ensuing year sown with lucerne, rape or other fodder.

[The article goes into others details and believes that the two branches of farming should be combined to the advantage of the farmer; providing a less precarious living, preserving the productivity of the soil and increasing the prosperity of the colony.]

Booborowie. 7 December. A reply from the Government re the District Council question has been delayed on account of opposition to it. The latest opponents being the travelling stock road movement. Their opposition is puzzling because it is well known that there was no grass for them before the District Council movement began. In the past the squatters ploughed, burnt and fed stock on the reserves, as they saw fir, to save their own grass from fires. This year there is grass and there have been three or four fires on the reserves. The worst began soon after the mail coach passed and burnt till 9 or 10 p.m. Part of Booborowie Run grass was consumed. The last on the 5th seemed to threaten the sheep station in gusty wind, but was extinguished by hail. No inquests are held to determine causes.

No portion of the settled areas is as poorly served with mail services as here. A daily post to Jamestown from Burra would greatly benefit Jamestown, Deep Creek and Belalie Plain. In the meantime we must all pay a labourer three shillings per annum to fetch letters from Kooringa.

Fencing in the district is making matters worse for settlers as road are being closed.

Burra Institute. 15 December. There was a good attendance at the laying of the foundations stones for the new Institute today, including a number of MPs and others from Adelaide. Freemasons and members of other lodges marched through the town to the Institute where stones were laid by Mr Alexander Stewart and Mr A. McCulloch JP. An excellent dinner followed at Banks’ Assembly Rooms. [Burra Hotel] R. Rees MP presided. A largely attended and successful entertainment was given at the Burra Hotel Assembly Room in the evening.

Mt Bryan DC has been newly formed and it is said a Chairman has been elected, an assessor appointed and a clerk and ranger chosen. The only notice of their intention to do so seems to have been a written notice in the bars of two public-houses. Ratepayers think they are entitled to know a little more of what is going on.

1874 &amp; 1875

1874 was a year of progress and prosperity in SA. The year began with a rather scanty wheat harvest. Despite that the exports for the year declined only a little; from £4,250,173 to £3,814,218. Despite low taxation the revenue is flourishing. The settlement of agricultural land and the occupancy of pastoral areas continue with encouraging rapidity. Squatters are extending to the very heart of the continent. In the last year some 450,000 acres have been added to the lands alienated from the crown. Railway extension is underway, albeit all too slowly, due mainly to the piecemeal approach to this development. This has also been hindered by a shortage of labour; a factor in many sectors of the economy. The population has grown by about 7,000 in twelve months, to about 205,000. Significant Acts of Parliament in 1874 included the University Act, schools have been improved, a step forward saw the abolition of Goyder’s Line of Rainfall and the management of main roads has been more localised. Much remains to be done on reforming land law and financial reform. Through the efforts of Warburton, Forrest, Gosse and Giles the unknown areas of the northwest have been almost eliminated. The overland telegraph to Port Darwin has been overhauled and is in splendid working order and every month the benefits of this undertaking become more apparent. Telegraph lines have been extended within SA. Moves are afoot to extend lines to Eucla on the West Australian coast and Cape Borda [on Kangaroo Island]. The Northern Territory remains a problem. Moves towards an Australian federation are very slow. 1875 begins with great prospects except that the mining sector is not as thriving as we would like.

Political Meeting at Burra

Mr W.R. Ridgway chaired a meeting of some 300 electors at the Burra Hotel on 28 January.

Mr Rowland Rees was welcomed and addressed the gathering. On education he supported payment by results and secularity. He would compromise on free education and support a small fee for those able to afford it. He would support a Bill to make education compulsory and would support legalising trades unions. He was in favour of opening more of the land to the east of Burra for cultivation. On the question of railways, he favoured a line from Farrell’s Flat to Jamestown as it would go through the centre of an agricultural district. He also favoured a line to the Barrier Ranges and one north from Port Augusta. He favoured free trade in conjunction with NSW &amp; Queensland, consolidation of the Real Property Act, extension of the jurisdiction of the Local Court and the payment of MPs.

W.B. Rounsevell was greeted with both cheers and disapprobation. He said he supported making larger areas of agricultural land available at £1 per acre. He considered immigration very necessary. He supported light and cheap railways, including an extension of the Pt Pirie line and construction of a feeding line to the Burra Trunk Railway. Primary education should be free, secular and compulsory. He favoured consolidation of the Real Property Act and would vote for stamp, legacy and succession duties. He supported free trade as far as possible, but was opposed to payment of MPs.

A vote declaring Mr Rees a fit representative was carried by a large majority. Votes for and against Mr Rounsevell were about equal.

Booborowie. 21 January. The heat today has been around 100°F in the shade. A fire has consumed many hundreds of acres of grass on the reserve near Mr Browne’s sheep station. Bridges over the Freshwater and Deep Creeks between Georgetown and Port Pirie have made it possible for light vehicles to get to the Burra railway about as quickly as they could get to Clare.

Railway surveyors are looking at the possible routes north from Clare and Burra.

A post office has been established at Baldry. Settlers at Andrews and Reynolds are as badly off as ever.

‘Scattergood’ writes concerning the need to attend far more seriously to roads. Much of the northern roadwork will be done in areas where there is little stone. In such areas in summer dust holes to axle depth on wagons develop and in winter [holes develop into bogs].

The writer proposes a law compelling the fitting of sled-shaped runners between the pairs of wheels so that when wheels sink six inches into dust or mud the sled takes the weight and the wagon is glided readily over the problem area.

Notice. The SA Mining Association gives notice of an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in Adelaide on 21 April. The purpose was to give the Directors (present or future) the right to sell allotments in the Township of Graham, laid out on a portion of the Special Survey, known as Section 1 Hundred of Kooringa.

Mt Bryan East, 8 March.

The harvest is over and most of the grain is bagged. Owing to smut, half-heads, locusts and rabbits, the yield is less than some farmers had hoped. The crop varied from 10-19 bushels per acre. Many are calling for a Bill compelling landowners to destroy rabbits.

The Mt Bryan DC seems to be dormant, as we hear nothing of their doings, although so near.

SA Mining Association. The report for the last half year shows symptoms of a marked revival. The prospect of the mine again paying dividends is not hopeless. In the six months to the end of March ore production was 1,308 tons, averaging 21% copper. This, with 499 tons in hand from September 1874 and 50 tons raised over the estimate for the half year before last makes 1,857 tons available for sale in the half year just ended. Of that 1,452 tons have been disposed of the E &amp; A Copper Co. leaving 405 tons on hand. As a result of these figures and a better price for copper the expected loss for the period of £2,164-4-10 has been reduced to a loss of £257-5-0; expenses being £19,438-0-4 and income from all sources £19,180-14-8. The probable balance of expected profits on the transactions of the last half year is £3,041-4-10.

Public Meeting on Medical and Educational Matters

A well-attended meeting on 14 May at Banks’ Assembly Room discussed what steps could be taken to assure the presence of another qualified medical practitioner in the district and to secure a local hospital. Captain Killicoat JP Presided. Several resolutions were passed and preliminary arrangements made. As our advertising pages indicate an early result can be expected. There was also a call for the establishment of one or more first-class Government schools in the neighbourhood. Further meetings can be expected on this matter.

Forder presented a financial statement showing a debt on the church and schoolroom of £730. The Anniversary proceeds were £80.

W.R. Ridgway’s new residence [in Aberdeen] is especially admired.

The Primitive Methodist Church bazaar on Monday and Tuesday was well attended and raised £60.

A Concert at the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms last night was in aid of a widow and orphans. The attendance was not as large as had been expected. [Performers and their items are listed.]

Kooringa, 9 June.

Heavy rain for several days has caused waters to rise and flood several parts of the road to Mt Bryan. Market Square is very dirty especially near the Miners’ Arms Hotel and Statton &amp; Henderson’s. There are miniature lagoons in front of the former establishment. Some of the back streets are in a disgraceful state.

Burra, 16 June.

Miss Marguerite Carole appeared before meagre audiences at the Burra Hotel assembly Rooms on Friday &amp; Saturday and at the Aberdeen Hotel on Monday. Such performances are not as well patronised as in the past. Locals now have a better appreciation of good singing and music. ‘Local talent exceeds that lately heard.’

Members of the Burra United and Golden Age Lodges were addressed by S.D. Hastings at the Primitive Methodist Schoolroom. Afterwards there was a meeting in the Bible Christian Church where Rev. T. Hillman presided. S.D. Hastings, Rev. G.W. Patchell, Rev. S. Gray and other Good Templars attended. The audience was very large. Mr Hastings lectured on Templarism and the prohibition of the liquor trade. A choir enlivened the proceedings. Town tradesmen closed their establishments at 6 o’clock that evening.

On Monday evening the Young Australian Cricket Club met at Martin’s Hotel [?] to present a bat to their highest scorer and a ball to their best bowler. The former went to C. Muller and the latter to J. Belcher.

Booborowie, 18 June.

The weather has been almost continually wet. The plains, for a want of proper channels to guide away the excess water, are in a shocking state. The eating house can be described as a lighthouse in the dark.

From Baldry Post Office to Gum Creek Paddock horses could propel a load better in a boat than in a wagon.

Wool in the drier parts of SA will be ‘breachy’ this year. Rain following locusts and a dry period will result in a weak section in the middle, which will break in manufacture. Wool in this area is excellent.

Excellent photographs of the Burra Mine taken by H.J. Thwaites deserve mention.

Wheat is beginning to appear and the hills are clad in a carpet of green.

Monday was not observed as a holiday in Burra; the tradesmen preferred to observe it on Thursday, the day of the annual mine holiday.

Laura to Burra. There have been recent complaints that mail on this run is late. A passenger on the route says this is readily explained by the state of the road. He says that for virtually the whole trip the conveyance was axle deep in mud and on each side there was a torrent of water.

6 July 1875, page 6

‘A Frequent Traveller’ writes from Aberdeen on 1 July, complaining about the Northern Mail Service.

He says the Laura-Port Augusta-Blinman Mail is due in Aberdeen on Wednesday, but does not arrive till Friday. Sometimes the guard arrives with the mail, but without the coach. These have been common results for months. The writer complains that the contractor is running an opposition coach on the north-eastern road thus depriving the route he has the mail contract for of sufficient horsepower.

‘The fact of the matter is that it is driving all the traffic away from this place to the Clare line, thus doing us a serious injury.’

‘I do not remember any time for a season that the Blinman contract has been carried on in such an unsatisfactory manner, and I fancy it must be the only line in the colony where the mail is always late.’

7 July 1875, page 5

The North. A correspondent tells the Northern Argus that the northern districts have received splendid rains and there is good feed on all the runs from Arkaba south. The coach from Blinman to Kooringa took ten days. The delay was principally due to weak horses between Blinman and Wonoka Creek. They seemed scarcely able to carry the weight of the harness, much less drag a coach on heavy roads.

15 July 1875, page 7

‘A Subscriber’ writes re the Mt Bryan Road. He does not think the Government can be aware of just how disgraceful its condition is for forty chains north and twenty chains south from the Mt Bryan Hotel. On 12 July he was stuck on the road in a light trap.

At present traffic in loaded drays is virtually at a standstill. Every shower makes it still more impassable. The coming harvest will generate much traffic to the Burra Station, not to mention the great quantities of wool en route to Port Adelaide. ‘I hope our worthy Commissioner of Public Works will at once take the matter up, and place this piece of road in a passable state; and I may say that the above road is our only feeder to the Burra Railway.’

16 July 1875, page 6

James Reed, G.C. Knight, Charles Morris, commercial travellers of Adelaide write re the Mt Bryan Road.

This road is the main one from Burra to the north and northeast and carried the mail to Jamestown, Port Augusta and Blinman. It also carries the goods for and the produce from the north and northeast. It ‘is the most ill-kept of any in the colony, and is a crying shame to the South Australian Government. Accidents frequently occur, teams of 10 or 12 horses are continually being “stuck,” and it often happens that passengers by this mail have to get out and help to push the coach along.’

26 July 1875, page 6

‘Also a Frequent Traveller’ writes in response to ‘Frequent Traveller’ re the North-Eastern Mails.

‘I think the statements therein need great modification. Perhaps I travel by Terry’s coaches more than any other man, and I most positively affirm that the finest teams to be got in South Australia could not keep the contract-time under the circumstances. The roads and creeks on this line are in such a very bad state that they would almost baffle description. No man could, in my opinion, do more to fulfil the obligations of the postal contract than the owner of these vehicles has done.’

26 July 1875, page 7

Redruth &amp; Aberdeen

‘Not Borrowed Plumes’ writes to correct the paper’s correspondent who reported great quantities of wheat coming into Kooringa. ‘He must mean Aberdeen.’ Despite having been in competition over the years, Redruth and Aberdeen, unitedly, are becoming a place of importance thanks to the efforts of Messrs Tiver, Ridgway, Pearce, Dawson, Roach, Butterworth and others. They have spent large sums in building handsome business premises and homes.

Kooringa, 20 July.

A complimentary dinner was given at the Aberdeen Hotel to H.J. Hood by young men of Kooringa and Aberdeen. About 30 sat down to an excellent spread prepared by Host Orchard. Mr W. Barker of Baldina presided. The meeting was to farewell Mr Hood.

[Apart from affirming that Hood was a jolly good fellow, the report does not reveal what he did in the town, or where he is going.]

29 July 1875, page 5

Local Government Meeting

A meeting of ratepayers was held at Orchard’s Hotel [Aberdeen Hotel] on the 26 July to consider the desirability of Aberdeen, Redruth and the suburban townships into a Municipal Corporation. Captain Killicoat, Chairman of the Burra DC, presided. He said that many thought the move highly desirable and saw a great need for a Town Council. W.R. Ridgway spoke in support of the move; he considered the District Council affairs had been much muddled. He thought the town badly under-represented in the DC. Aberdeen-Redruth had grown of late and this was a trend likely to continue. He moved that a Corporation should be made comprising Redruth, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Graham, Roachtown, Nelson, Hampton &amp; Millerton. Seconded by A. Bartholomæus.

O. Harvey moved that the time for a Corporation had not arrived. Mr Ridgway had not done his calculations well. There were too few houses to support a Council. Harvey asserted that a 1/- rate would bring in only £150 and a 2/- one £300 and they could hardly manage with less than that. He then went on to calculate that after necessary expenses they would only have £75 p.a. for roadwork.

W.R. Ridgway disputed both Harvey’s valuation and his list of necessary expenditures.

The chairman declared Harvey’s amendment carried by a majority of six.

Captain Killicoat defended the DC against Mr Ridgway’s remarks. The latter had contended that the DC spent very little in Redruth Ward, but a large sum had been spent. Roads had been made. He would like to see Mr Ridgway do half as much for the same amount. He had come to fill the chair, but had he known the sort of remarks Mr Ridgway had made were to be presented, he would not have attended.

30 July 1875, page 7

‘Stuck on the Road’ writes re the Mt Bryan Road.

The road is a miserable quagmire for half a mile north and half a mile south of the Mt Bryan Hotel.

‘It is decidedly impassable for any traffic. Carts and buggies get bogged, horses floundering in the mud, not being able to keep their footing. Poles of wagons are broken, and their wheels buried to their axles, the poor drivers wading knee deep in mud. There cannot be a worst piece of road in the colony.’

Considering the heavy traffic, it is a disgrace and if immediate action is not taken no wool or wheat will be able to come down this coming season. In heavy rain it is more like a river than a road, with water reaching from fence to fence for a mile in length.

2 August 1875, page 5

Shearing. About 50 shearers arrived in Burra by the first train on 30 July. In two parties, they were transported onwards by three of Messrs Jackson’s coaches, heading for Mt Gipps and Sturt Meadows Stations. They are the first shearers sent north from Adelaide for this season.

Mt Bryan East, 19 July.

Rain, hail and snow are the order of the day. A two-hour snow storm swept in from the southwest last Saturday. The snow lasted till Sunday night, making the hills very picturesque. Farmers are busy fallowing, fencing and clearing, but crops are backward due to the cold. Fortunately almost all last year’s grain has been despatched, because the roads are now in a wretched state. A District Council is needed – a shilling rate could at least make creek crossings passable.

Rabbits are a great pest and the Rabbit Nuisance Bill needs to be passed, compelling landowners to destroy the pest.

A public school is needed here.

Various road works were ordered.

12 August 1875, page 5

Mt Bryan Road. On 10 August the Register received a letter from ‘Settler’

The writer drew attention to the recent correspondence re the Mt Bryan Road.

As this road is the only route for some 12,000 bales of wool from the interior to the terminus of the Northern Railway a number of settlers guaranteed subscriptions of £200 and an arrangement was made with the Government through the Commissioner of Public works to make a track passable for drays over this piece of road and a start has been made. An offer from a neighbouring settler to make the road passable for £400 was rejected by the Government and it was supposed they would accomplish the work themselves. Late last night it was with surprise that a telegram announced that unless a further £100 was guaranteed, the work would stop. It will be recalled that after a deputation about 12 months ago, it was promised that this piece of road would be repaired. Now one of the main arteries of the colony is to be left a quagmire unless the settlers subscribe a further £100.

The writer continues to criticise the Government in harsh terms and rather than print this from an anonymous source, the paper asked the Government for its side of the story.

[While giving further detail the Government essentially confirmed that it entered into the above arrangement, and that when Mr Morris, the Superintending Surveyor for the District assessed the cost of repairs at £600, the Government was not prepared to spend more than was matched by the settlers, hence the telegram asking for a guarantee of a further £100. Since then the Government has been asked for £200 provisionally upon the settlers themselves doing the work for £400. To this proposal the Government has agreed, though the Government is still prepared to spend £300 if the settlers will match that sum.

Obituary/Inquest

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest at the Burra Hotel on 11 August on the body of Jane Goodfellow, wife of J.A. Goodfellow, who had been found dead in her bed that morning. E. Lipsett, foreman of the jury.

John Andrew Goodfellow, licensed surveyor, described coming home at about midnight, having supper and then taking a 20-month-old girl from the cradle and putting her with his wife in bed. He did not try to wake his wife, as she was very tired after washing all day. He got up at 7.30 a.m. to get milk from a boy at the door and returned to bed. His wife appeared to be asleep. The child awoke about 9 a.m. and when he tried to rouse his wife he discovered she was cold and dead. He sent for the deceased’s mother and Dr Dashwood, who said the deceased must have been dead for some hours. Deceased had not complained of any illness, nor had she taken any medicine to his knowledge. He had no reason to think she was contemplating suicide. There was no one else in the house except another child aged 8.

Annie Mann, sister to the deceased, had seen her about 9.30 p.m. the previous night. She had not noticed anything unusual abut her and she had not apparently been ill. She said she had been washing and had a pain in her back.

Ellen Bourke has seen her in the garden about 5 o’clock the previous evening and heard her peak to the children.

Dr Cave said he had received a message from Dr Dashwood at about 11.30 a.m. asking him to see to the deceased as he was very indisposed and not able to attend to her. [Cave then described the position and other aspects of the body and said that rigor was fully developed.]

He saw no signs of external violence. The deceased was apparently pregnant and death may have resulted from fainting or internal bleeding.

The inquest was then adjourned for Dr Cave to conduct a post mortem.

[The report then goes into considerable detail on the appearance and condition of various body organs. The key discoveries were that the lungs were very congested and highly oedematous. The right side of the heart contained a considerable quantity of clotted blood.]

Dr Cave concluded that the condition of the heart and lungs were sufficient to cause death. The heart had probably been affected for years, but the lungs only recently.

The jury found that the deceased had died from natural causes.

‘Before the rising of the Court the Coroner said that the Resident Government Medical Officer, Dr Dashwood, had treated the Coroner and Jury in a very disrespectful manner. He was the first medical man to see the body, and the proper person to have given evidence, but had sent a very lame excuse through Dr Cave for non-attendance, after having been requested by Lance-Caporal Smith to attend. It was well known that Dr Dashwood had been attending private persons during the sitting of the Court, and if he could attend patients he could have been in court. The Foreman said that the majority of the Jury fully concurred in these remarks.’

[Jane Goodfellow is registered as dying 10 August 1875 at Kooringa aged 32. She was born Jane Armstrong.]

Accident. John Sanders aged 12, the son of Captain Sanders, left F.R. White’s school at 4 p.m. on the 24 August along with his brother, W. Killicoat and a lad called West. On their way home they went for a ride in the large balance box at the engine-house at the Mine. While there Sanders saw his brother-in-law coming and tried to get away by clinging to steps leading to the landing, but the box came up and crushed him severely. The bottom part of his body was a mass of blood and broken bones, with a large wound in the abdomen. Drs Cave and Dashwood are attending, but hold no hope of survival.

[In view of this, it is unexpected to find no death for this youth on SA Deaths CD.]

Railway Extension to the Northeast

On 16 September a deputation waited on the Commissioner of Public Works, with whom was the Engineer-in-Chief, H.C. Mais, with reference to railway communications in the northeast.

Mr Rounsevell read a petition with upwards of 300 signatures. While pleased at the Government’s interest in railway extensions in the northeast, the petitioners wished to impress upon them the necessity of immediately taking in hand the construction of a railway because not only was the transportation of wool important, but as soon as the railway reached Yarcowie a great deal more land would be brought under cultivation. They did not press for Burra over the Farrell’s Flat for the point of departure for the new line, as the surveyors took the line in either case to Yarcowie.

Mr Faulkner said that in view of the awful condition of the road between Yarcowie and Burra the settlers had had to put their hands into their pockets to make the road passable. The road was worse now than when deputations had waited on the Government in the past. A commercial traveller had had his horse smothered on the line and over 30 horses had been required to get one wagon through a particular part. Because of the road farmers were compelled to send their produce directly after harvest at a lower price, rather than wait till they could get a higher price later on. The extension of the railway would make a difference of 3d a bushel. The traffic was very great and the deputation came not to embarrass the Government, but to strengthen their hand.

Mr Down pointed out that the road required constant attention.

Mr Matty said the section between Mt Bryan and Willogoleeche was particularly bad. The previous month he had been bogged with a wagon for five days, although he had 18 horses attached. The shafts were broken and the goods had to be brought in on another wagon. A couple of hours’ rain made the road quite impassable. Mr Rees endorsed these arguments and stressed also the need for postal and telegraphic communication to Yarcowie and Terowie.

Mr Hannaford said metal roads should not be constructed where railways were intended. The late Central Road Board had not been able to make the road passable for want of sufficient money.

The Commissioner of Public Works, Mr West-Erskine, endorsed the need to increase the facilities for the transport of produce to market from the northeast. He thought they should agree that the Government had lost no time in acting when its condition had been brought before them. The Government could not make bricks without straw and until they had the legal funds and the legislative sanction to proceed, they could not construct the railway. He assured them that as soon as possible railway extension would be undertaken, and while he could not say which line would receive priority, but rapid settlement in the area would warrant the Government in losing no unnecessary time.

Mount Bryan East Meeting

A public meeting on the district’s problems was held on 10 September.

T. Best moved that the inhabitants move to get the Eastern Plains mail to pass through Mt Bryan East rather than as at present to Munjibbie and thence to Ketchowla via Piltimitiappa. This would see the mail carried more cheaply and service a larger population. A committee was set up to get a memorial to this effect drawn up and signed.

J. Prior moved for the appointment of JPs in the Hundreds of Hallett and Kingston. This proposal was seconded by S. Roberts and adopted.

G. Harry moved amotion urging the Government to act to make landowners responsible for rabbit control. J. Montgomery seconded and this was unanimously supported.

There was also unanimous agreement that it was time the area had a District Council and a special meeting will be called on this subject.

Obituary/Inquest

An inquest was held at the White Hart Hotel on the body of an unknown man who died at Cartarpo Creek [sic] on Saturday evening 25 September. J.D. Cave JP was coroner.

W. Cockrum, sheepfarmer, described meeting the man in Burra on 2 September and giving him a job as a shepherd, despite having doubts about his experience in that position. [Much more detail is provided.]

He saw him last Monday and counted out a flock of sheep for him. Cockrum then went north and did not return till Saturday, when he learned of the man’s death. He thought the man was about 56, did not know much about the colony and was sober when taken on.

Thomas Roberts of Cartarpo described meeting deceased about three weeks before the death. He described seeing the deceased every night for a week.

He was sent by Mr Cockrum to see how the man was getting on with the flock. He went to Gabriel Cockrum’s place, but the deceased was not there. He went seeking him towards Burra and while he was away the deceased had returned. He saw deceased on 17 September when the deceased had said he was not managing well with the sheep. Saw him next on Friday when he was by the fire in the hut. Deceased said he felt very weak and had a pain in the stomach. He was spitting blood and his legs were swollen. On Saturday at Sundown the girl Jessie McDonald came and said she thought the man was dying. When he went to the hut the deceased was outside the hut, dead.

Jessie McDonald said deceased had spent two or three days at Gabriel Cockrum’s and had gone then to live in the hut not far from the station. The deceased had said he was 56 years old last June and his Christian name was Thomas. On Saturday she had taken him some maizena at about 6 p.m. and had found him outside his hut, dying. He was then breathing, but did not speak.

W. Peel Nesbitt, medical practitioner said he had examined the body of a man of about 60 in an advanced state of decomposition. There were no external signs of violence and no reason to suspect foul play. He believed the man had died of a disease of the chest, but there was insufficient evidence to say its nature.

Alfred Bradley, police trooper described the body when the matter was reported and outlined the meagre possessions. Deceased was 5 ft 4 inches in height and had lost the forefinger of his right hand between the first and second joints. The jury found he had died from natural causes.

Kooringa, 29 September.

The first in a series of 6d popular concerts was held in the Wesleyan Schoolroom on Friday evening to standing room only. Rev. G.W. Patchell was Chairman and A.H. Forder played the harmonium.

On Monday evening Rev. E.F. Kingdon lectured at the Bible Christian Chapel to a moderate crowd on ‘Popular Delusions’.

On Tuesday evening at the Assembly Room at the Miners’ Arms about 30 gentlemen met to consider accepting the offer of the SA Mining Association to transfer the present hospital to trustees and to take such steps as would secure this object. Captain I. Killicoat chaired the meeting. Several residents spoke of the benefits of such a move and a decision to accept the offer was carried unanimously. A committee to arrange preliminaries was appointed: Captain R. Sanders, Messrs J. Drew, H. Dawson, W.R. Ridgway, W.H. Rosman Jnr, T. Bath &amp; W. Builder.

R. Austin’s new premises at Aberdeen are now complete and at Kooringa many old places are being renovated. The town has a much more cheerful appearance than three or four years ago.

Frederick C. Austin writes from York Hotel, Adelaide 6 October.

Last Saturday a man broke his thigh at Ketchowla. He was sent to Burra for treatment at 12.30 p.m. and endured a very painful ten hour journey. Weary and in pain and suffering intense pain he presented a letter of recommendation to Dr Nesbitt, requesting the latter to put him where he thought it would be most quiet. Dr Nesbitt recommended J.G. Lamb’s Burra Hotel. There he was refused accommodation on the grounds there were already tow sick men in the house. There was no claim the house was full. When I spoke to Mr Lamb on the matter, he could only say he had not personally refused accommodation. The man was taken in by Mr Richardson of the Miners’ Arms, although his house was quite full. I do not need to remark upon the case.

‘I would merely ask if there is no law to prevent such wanton cruelty? And are bushmen, because they happen to be wounded and incapable, to be refused admittance to hotels, which are licensed for the general accommodation of the public as well as for the profit of the landlords?’

Knocking Down Cheques at Burra

A correspondent recently reported from a third un-named party that at Burra now many shearers were being encouraged by publicans to ‘knock down their cheques’, resulting in many disgraceful scenes. After making careful enquiry we are satisfied that this report is much exaggerated. Several hundred shearers have passed through the town on their return from the stations, but there has been much less drunkenness than this time last year. This is attributed to the vigilance of the trooper on duty, who, we are assured, exerts himself energetically to suppress the malpractices which are unhappily so common.

SA Mining Association. Burra Mine.

The latest half-yearly report shows that in the six months to 30 September 922 tons of 243⁄4% copper ore have been raised. The net profit has been £2,990-16-11. The Directors state that after making provision for all outgoings, including the expenditure of upwards of £3,000 incurred during the last half-year in works connected with the future development of the mines in depth, there is a total profit remaining of £13,870-17-2.

Captain Sanders said he has introduced some improved dressing machinery, by means of which he has been able to dress ores to a much higher percentage than usual. The machinery is reported in good order and the establishment is 274 men and boys. Operations are proceeding to prove the mine at greater depth and the Directors are hopeful that this will lead to valuable discoveries of ore.

Re-opening of the Burra Institute

Mr A. McCulloch of Princess Royal reopened the Institute on Thursday evening 14 October. The building covers about 5,000 square feet and consists of a main building with two wings. The entrance is by eleven steps of Mintaro slate, with a terrace 10 ft x 30 ft covered with very large Mintaro slates. The entrance Hall, which is also intended for a museum, is 20 ft x 35 ft and 20 ft high. The Lecture Hall is 54 ft x 34 ft and 20 ft high and is entered by sliding doors 12 ft x 12 ft, so as to throw the entrance hall into the lecture hall if it should be crowded at any time. To the right of the entrance hall are two doors opening into rooms set apart for committee and class rooms; one 24 ft x 16 ft and the 24 ft x 13 ft, and 14 ft high. To the left is one door leading to the reading room and library, which are of the same dimensions as the rooms on the right. The Lecture Hall is lighted with four chandeliers, the entrance hall with two and the other rooms with one each. The doors of the rooms are grained oak colour with the exception of the reading room, which is painted. The land is a gift from the SA Mining Association and has been conveyed to trustees. The frontage is 204 ft and the depth 219 ft and its value is estimated at over £800. The gift should therefore be appreciated by the residents.

The first contract and extras for alterations to the left wing amounted to £166-10-4. The present contract, including extras, conveyance of land, seats, etc. is for £1,416-11-8. Blinds, lamps etc. have cost £65-12-0. The cash received to this time has been £551-4-10 and the Government grant amounts to £750, while the ordinary grant in aid is £136-1-4. There will remain a debt of about £230. The trustees are Mr A. McCulloch, Captain I. Killicoat and Messrs T. Bath, P. Lane &amp; A. Bartholomæus. At the opening Mr Lane, as Chairman of Trustees, handed the keys to Mr McCulloch, saying he had done so much to support and aid the Institute. Mr McCulloch said he would continue to do all he could to forward the interests of the Institute. He felt that they would not long be in debt. They now had a fine building and a nice reading room and he hoped young people would spend many useful hours there. He had pleasure in declaring the building open.

Mr McCulloch chaired the entertainment that followed. Mr T. Bath said he was not about to glorify himself or the others who had energetically set about erecting such a fine building, but he hoped to impress upon those yet young in life the advantages of contributing to the general welfare of the community. He reflected on his connection with the Institute, saying he recalled meeting at the house of their secretary, Mr Wells about 19 years ago at a meeting called by the late Rev. D.J. Ibbetson who was the first to start a subscription list for an Institute in Burra. It was now well established and was the oldest in the colony outside the metropolitan area. He hoped it would become the best in resources and offerings as well.

Mr W. Townsend MP said he recalled the old Institute and its history. He was pleased to be present at the opening and hoped it would be an incentive to those people in the rising townships in newly settled areas. The handsome building would compare favourably with many in the old country.

[There were other votes of thanks interspersed with songs. Mr Townsend gave a lecture on Lights and Shadows of London Life.]

A concert in aid of the Institute was held on Friday 15 October and was a great success both artistically and financially. [The performers and their items are listed.]

‘A Looker-on’ writes on ‘How to destroy roads’.

[He is commenting on a report that W. Halliday recently arrived in Burra with a 49-bale or 91⁄2 ton load of wool. He questions the damage that such loads do to a road that until recently was deemed impassable. Surely, he says, there is no reason why two loads of 24 or 25 bales should not have been substituted with less damage to the road. He also makes comparisons with common loads in England to suggest colonial horses are grossly overloaded. These heavy loads rapidly reduce 21⁄2 inch cubes of stone to powder. The Width of Tyres Act should be amended so that the load carried should not exceed 8 cwt per inch of tyre, including the weight of the vehicle. This would save many thousands of pounds annually and provide great relief to many overloaded and ill-treated animals.

Knocking Down Cheques at Burra

In our recent article on this subject it now appears we misunderstood our informant insofar as stating that the changed conditions there were due to Police Constable Wilson.

James Sullivan writes in response to a letter signed ‘W.H. Geddes’, Burra Hotel, which appeared in the Observer of 16 October. Sullivan begs to contradict Geddes statements regarding the young man Ryan from Ketchowla, with the broken leg.

As one of the party that came from Ketchowla, I can say that the barman, as I supposed him to be, bluntly refused to take the man in, although we offered to pay any charge he might make until Monday morning, when the patient was to go to Adelaide Hospital by train. I must say that Mr Austin did all he could considering the distance in the bush, that any kind feeling gentleman could do for a poor unfortunate bushman.

Political Meeting at Kooringa

About 100 people attended a meeting at the Institute on Thursday night to consider the present political situation.

I. Killicoat JP presided. He said he believed the Government was go-ahead and was acting in the best interests of the colony. He referred to the proposal to extend various railway lines to open up the country and provide facilities for settlers. He acknowledged that this would require more revenue. The Government had proposed stamp, legacy and succession duties, which had passed the House of Assembly, but been blocked in the Legislative Council. The Government felt that this was a vital part of their policy and had asked for a response from the electors.

Dr Stephens proposed that the meeting supports the policy proposed by the Government for the construction of railways and other reproductive work. He spoke of his recent visit to the USA where the spread of railways was essential in the development of the country and its resources. [His argument is reported at length.]

Thomas drew seconded and Mr Owen Harvey spoke in support. He supported the bold move to borrow £3 million to build 500 or 600 miles of railway. He had originally signed a petition against the Stamps Duties Bill without due consideration and now supported the Government’s proposals.

Captain Sanders thought that if the policy had a fault, it was in not being bold enough. He was confident that the railways would open up agricultural land and bring rich mineral resources into production. The cost of borrowing £3 million would be only 12/- per head of the population and was an investment about which future generations would rejoice.

W.R. Ridgway also endorsed the policy and the proposal was carried without dissent.

Henry Dawson moved that the meeting consider the passing of the Stamps and Succession Duties Bill an essential portion of the Ministerial policy.

He said that with the income the Bill would provide the Government could go with confidence to the English capitalists and borrow the sums they needed for the development of the colony. He spoke too of why an income tax at this stage was both unnecessary and inefficient. He was surprised at the negative reaction of bankers and merchants. The latter in particular would surely benefit from the development of the colony that was proposed. People in Burra hardly needed it explained to them how towns benefited from the telegraph and railway.

Charles Lowe seconded. The Government had acted unencumbered by party intrigue or sectional obligations and was taking a wider and longer term view of the benefit to the colony as a whole.

Philip Lane spoke in support. The Stamps Bill would affect mainly the wealthy and money-lenders, some of whom were in the Legislative Council. At Burra cartage by road had been £8-£10 per ton and was now 23/- to 30/- per ton by rail. The Burra district’s development would have stopped, but for the railway. The new Bill would shift taxes from the working class, who were unfairly imposed upon while Government income was reliant upon import duties. He also supported the proposal of the Government to grant contractors for public works £15 per man they introduced into the colony. [He developed his argument at some length.]

‘He regretted that the Bill had been thrown out by the Council. He certainly thought that Sir Henry Ayers, whom he considered to be an able politician, would have acted differently; but it seemed he had missed his mark and the members of the Council followed where Sir Henry led them, like little puppies.’

This motion was also carried without dissent.

Mr E. Lipsett thoroughly supported the Government policy and moved that the Memorial to both Houses of Parliament, recently adopted at Port Adelaide, be also adopted by this meeting.

P. Jane seconded, W. Pearce supported and the motion was carried unanimously.

Mr Rees MP had come from Adelaide at some inconvenience to attend the meeting, but on hearing that it was a local affair, he refrained from attending. At the end of the meeting Joseph Roberts moved a vote of thanks to Mr Rees for making the trip. J.D. Cave moved an amendment that no such vote be recorded as Mr Rees should not have come without an invitation and the idea of the meeting was not to be influenced by what their Parliamentary representative might say, but rather to influence their representative. James Waters seconded the amendment. After animated discussion in which several speakers regretted anything like disrespect being shown to Mr Rees, the motion was heartily carried.

Mt Bryan East, 26 October.

There have been splendid rains and crops are looking good. Farmers are speculating about the time scale for the damage of locusts. They are hatching in millions, but their appearance seems to be getting later each year and so they may die out in time.

Farmers wish to see the Rabbit Act put into force as soon as possible.

Kooringa, 26 October.

Anniversary services for the Kooringa Wesleyan Church were held on Sunday 17 October. Rev. R.W. Campbell preached in the morning and evening and Rev. S. Gray (Primitive Methodist) in the afternoon.

Attendance was good, but at the tea on Tuesday in the schoolroom attendance was very small due to the rain.

Dr Stephens presided at the public meeting. He has recently arrived from America. On the next afternoon the Institute was provided with a magnificent spread and the weather being fine, the attendance was large. After the tea Rev. S. Knight gave his lecture on The Anglo Saxons. [Other contributors to the entertainment are listed.]

[This report seems a little confused. Presumably Dr Stephens’ meeting was on Monday, as the usual practice was to hold a tea-meeting the day after the anniversary services. The Tuesday tea is not explained.]

Kooringa, 27 October.

The stoppage of the Callington Mine has seen a large increase in the mining population here.

An entertainment was held at the Institute last night in aid of the Church of England Parsonage Repair Fund.

[Details are given.]

Business is still brisk both in Kooringa and at Aberdeen.

Kooringa, 11 November.

The anniversary services of the Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School were held last Sunday and continued on the following Tuesday. Rev. G.W. Patchell preached on Sunday morning and evening. In the afternoon there was a Service of Sacred Song: Life of St Joseph. John Roach presided at the public tea.

On Tuesday evening in the Institute Hall O. Harvey presided at a concert in aid of the Roman Catholic Church. The hall was comfortably filled. [Performers are listed.]

Hay is being harvested.

The wood market has been and remains brisk. Large supplies are being taken to the Burra Mine and to the two flour mills. 157 wood licences have been issued at Redruth and about 700 tons are delivered weekly, chiefly from scrub east of Kooringa. The amount received from timber licences in one month is £59-17-6. The Crown Ranger is indefatigable in seeing that all teamsters have licences and it is gratifying to see the friendly terms that exist between him and the men.

Obituary/Inquest. An inquest was held at the Miners’ Arms hotel, Kooringa, by J.D. Cave JP on Saturday 20 November regarding John Roberts who died suddenly while lying on a form outside the hotel.

William Turley, miner, said he had worked with the deceased for about 5 weeks at Waukaringa, and they had arrived in Burra on Tuesday week. He had seen the deceased several times since and he had seemed healthy. Last spoke to him on Friday and saw him about 3 or 4 o’clock on Saturday at the Miners’ Arms. When deceased went to Waukaringa he had complained of a pain in the chest and said he had come out of the Burra Hospital.

Thomas Richardson, landlord of the Miners’ Arms said he had known deceased for 18-20 years. He came to the hotel about two weeks ago and seemed to be in good health. Knew the deceased had been in the Burra Hospital about six weeks ago, suffering from rheumatic fever. He did not drink much. Had nothing but peppermint that day. He saw deceased at 10 o’clock when he told him to go into dinner. Did not see him again till 5 o’clock when Mr Pounce told him there was a man outside lying on the form. Went out and put him in a sitting position and unfastened his shirt at the neck. Deceased did not appear to be dead when taken into the house. Thought he drank some water, but he did not speak and the witness did not notice him breathing.

When Dr Nesbitt came he said the man was dead.

John Vivian, barman said deceased drank gin and peppermint, but with very little gin. Refused to give him strong drink, having been advised by W. Turley not to do so.

William Pounce had known deceased 14 years and considered him a strong, hard-working man. Saw him at the Hospital two or three months ago and also at the bar counter on Thursday. Saw him several times in the bar on Friday. Deceased appeared to be suffering from former drinking. He was not drunk then. But looked rather muddled. Spoke to him about 11 a.m. when he did not complain of illness.

Dr W. Peel Nesbitt said he went to the Miners’ Arms about 5 p.m. and found the man dead. He considered the evidence insufficient to show a cause of death.

A post mortem examination was then ordered.

William Wilson said he has seen the deceased the last eight or ten days lying on forms at the Pig and Whistle and the Miners’ Arms. Never noticed him drunk. Saw him about 10.30 a.m. that morning, lying on the form. Felt his pulse – there was a great throbbing on the right side. When he awoke asked what he intended to do and advised he get work at the mine. He said he was going to work Monday morning.

Dr Nesbitt after the post mortem said the deceased had signs of pleurisy. The lungs were congested, but otherwise healthy. The heart was enormously enlarged, particularly the left ventricle and both sets of valves on the left were considerably diseased. This was the cause of death and the disease had no doubt been brought on by rheumatic fever. This disease usually terminated in sudden death.

The jury found that John Roberts died from disease of the heart.

[John Roberts died 20 November 1875 Kooringa aged 35.]

Obituary. Death in Redruth Gaol

An inquest was held at Redruth Gaol on 24 November into the death of Algernon G. Johnson, a prisoner who had been received at the gaol the previous Saturday on a charge of larceny and who was suffering from the effects of long and excessive drinking. On Saturday the authorities had thought the deceased was suffering from delirium tremens because he made no complaints. On Sunday morning the doctor saw that his leg was in such a bad state that there was little hope of his surviving. J. Drew JP was coroner and E.P. Fisher the foreman.

Thomas Perry, Keeper of the Redruth Gaol, said deceased had been sent from Riverton on 20 November for trial at the Supreme Court, charged with breaking into Mr Ausell’s cellar at Saddleworth and stealing two bottles of whisky and some liqueurs. He was suffering from the effects of drink. When he did not approve, sent for the doctor who attended the next morning. Deceased had bruises, called doctor’s attention to his leg and deceased had fomentations and the doctor’s directions were carried out. Johnson complained of being sore through falls occasioned by drinking. He said he had fallen into a creek at Riverton when with his wife. He said the injury to his leg was sustained before his arrival at the gaol.

George W. Goodhart JP, Visiting Justice to Redruth Gaol, said he saw the deceased the day before his death. He then had no complaints about his treatment at the gaol, but had some against the trooper who arrested him. He appeared quite sensible and said he was getting better. Saw deceased on the day of his death between 10 and 11 a.m. when he made the following statement:

‘I, Algernon Johnson, otherwise George Johnson, came in the colony fifteen years ago, I am accused of stealing four bottles of spirits of wine, of which I have no recollection. I am not sure how I hurt my leg. Think it has been in my blood a long time. I think the least twist or accident might have brought it on. I fell down a creek two or three times. Very likely I hurt myself then. Am certain it is an internal injury. Have been used to very hard work and when at work I worked too heavy. Have had great nervousness come over me this last 12 months, but never had it so bad before. Have no blame to attach to anyone I know of. Am sure if I went on much longer I should not be ‘countable’ for my actions. It has already affected my brain. When I fell down the creek I was walking with my wife to a neighbour’s. I did not take much notice of it at the first. Have had much knocking about and falling from horses. Would not like to blame anyone for the injuries I have received. Do not seem to know what I am doing half my time. If I go into a strange place I do not know what I am doing. I know I am a different man to what I was three years ago. I have been very well treated since I have been in the Gaol. Could not have been better. It upset me a good deal not being able to walk on my foot. Had been drinking at the same house that I was charged with stealing the spirits from. I make this statement and am certain that it is true.

A.G. Johnson.’

Dr William Peel Nesbitt said he saw the patient Sunday morning when he was suffering from the effects of drinking and injury. He complained of his head and several bruises, but said his leg did not pain him. Examined the leg which was much swollen. Considered his case hopeless. Saw him daily after that. For the last two or three days he was sensible, though suffering the effects of drink. He could give no account of how his leg came to be bad. It must have been so for some days before his admission to the gaol. Death was due to blood poisoning and diffuse cellulitis. He was in delirium tremens on Sunday morning. Saw no marks on his wrists to indicate he had been badly used by the police-trooper. Should judge the injury to his leg occurred prior to his arrest.

Robert Dunn, another prisoner, who had nursed the deceased, corroborated the kindly treatment of the deceased at the gaol, as did John Cleary, another prisoner.

The Jury found that death was due to blood poisoning due to excessive drinking.

After the verdict Trooper Campbell, the arresting officer arrived from Riverton by train. He said the deceased had been drinking for a fortnight before his arrest and had been lying out and wandering about. He had been arrested on Wednesday and behaved quietly until being committed for trial on Friday. After that he became excited and violent. On his return to the police cell he struggled violently with the trooper, wrenched the handle off the cell bucket and with it made a hole through the cell wall, broke the side off his stretcher and struck at the witness. The trooper used no unnecessary force in dealing with deceased, who had complained of a stiffness and peculiar feeling in his leg when first arrested.

The coroner on behalf of the jury thanked Mr Perry for the humane manner in which he had attended the deceased.

Kooringa, 1 December.

Dr Antliff delivered his interesting lecture on temperance in the Institute Hall on Saturday to a fair audience. He preached three sermons on Sunday. In the afternoon and evening the attendance was so large that the lecture and entrance halls had to be thrown into one. On Monday a tea-meeting at the Primitive Methodist Chapel was well attended. Afterwards, at the Institute, the Revs G.W. Patchell, S. Wellington, S. Gray and T. Hillman gave the Rev. Dr Antliff a hearty welcome. S. Olley of Riverton took the chair. Dr Antliff gave a very amusing speech and on the next evening gave his popular lecture Happiness in Wedlock. Captain Sanders presided.

On Sunday morning the Roman Catholic Bishop confirmed 50 young persons and celebrated mass assisted by Rev. J. Tappeiner. His Lordship then went on to Hanson [i.e. Farrell’s Flat].

Hay harvesting is virtually finished. Locusts are flying about in great numbers, but as yet have not damaged crops very much. Reaping should begin in 10-14 days if the good weather continues.

The Burra Mill. Mr J. Roach of the Burra Flour Mill began grinding new wheat on 7 December. The sample was nice, clean, full grain from the Eastern Plains some ten miles from Kooringa. Several loads are expected this week, as the weather has lately been too dull for reaping.

Political Meeting at Kooringa, 10 December

A meeting was held at the Assembly Room at the Miners’ Arms this evening to discuss the Government’s policies and the rejection by the Legislative Council of the Stamps Duties Bill.

Mr Lane presided and explained the meeting had been delayed by Dr Antliff’s series of lectures in the town.

Dr Stephens moved a motion supporting the Government’s policies to advance the colony.

Thomas Moody seconded the motion, which was carried with acclamation.

William Pierce [sic: for Pearce] proposed a motion condemning the rejection of the Stamps Duty Bill by the Legislative Council by one vote as unconstitutional in principle and opposed to Parliamentary usage, given that it had the unanimous approval of the assembly and the almost universal assent of the elective body.

He accused Sir Henry Ayers of acting out of jealousy; contending that Ayers would have supported the move had he been on the Treasury benches.

F.W. Holder seconded. He thought it was time to amend the constitution. He expected that out of the present evil it would emerge that one third of the Council would have to resign at each dissolution of the House of Assembly. Passed without dissent.

O. Harvey moved that the action of Sir Henry Ayers and those who voted with him against the other half of their own House justifies those who elected them in now demanding their resignation. Seconded by C. Lowe and carried.

C. Lowe proposed the time had arrived for an amendment to the constitution limiting the powers of the Legislative Council and calling for the formation of an Association to be called The Kooringa Legislative Reform Association. Carried unanimously, after being seconded by Thomas Moody and supported by William Woollacott.

Political Meeting at Kooringa

[This is a lengthier report on the same meeting that was reported on 11 December. Perhaps the most interesting additional information is in William Pearce’s speech, where hie says:

‘Sir Henry Ayers had generally been obstructive. There was a time when he was thoroughly obstructive to the working-classes of that district. When the township of Redruth was being sold he did his best to outbid each tradesman and workman, so that the allotments were run up to a fearful price. (A voice – “That’s quite true.”)’]

Death from alcoholic poisoning.

[On page 5 there is an editorial column expressing horror and indignation at the death of Robert Burvill at Manoora. He was drinking there with friends and consumed virtually an entire bottle of gin after other drinks and died in the street. The friends propped him up against the door of the hotel and left him, uncertain whether he was dead or alive. The editor expresses his disgust at their behaviour and that of the landlord who supplied the liquor that killed him. Page 7 reports the inquest. The jury found: ‘That the deceased Robert Burvill came to his death from the effects of alcoholic poisoning, which brought on apoplexy. The Jury cannot help expressing their deep disgust at the treatment deceased received at the hands of his companions, Fred. J. James and Alf. Wm. Steer, in leaving him dead or alive exposed to the inclemency of the weather of Saturday night.’]

[SA Deaths CD shows the registration of death as Robert Burrill died 13 December 1875 at Manoora, residence near Manoora aged 26.]

[A letter to the editor on 21 from John Charles seeks to clear him of any involvement in the events of the 13 December. He says he left the bar at 10.45 p.m. and had nothing to do with the drink consumed after that. Those in the bar were sober when he left. He also defends the licensee Mr Thomas Edwards.

A letter on 22 December from Thomas Edwards seeks to defend him from any improper behaviour. He says the evidence at the inquest proved the deceased was sober when he left the bar and he was not responsible for what happened thereafter. Also, had he been informed that the deceased had been left on his doorstep he would have got up and seen to him, even though he was suffering from asthma and it would have been at some danger to his own health.]

22 December 1875, page 7

Booborowie, 15 December.

The weather has been boisterous and this has delayed reaping. Locusts and high winds have knocked much grain out of the heads, especially near the edges of fields. Nevertheless, the prospects overall are for a fair average yield.

The rate of wages is as high as 30/- a week plus board and lodging, for able-bodied men.

[The correspondent complains that not one penny of the £2,349 supplied to the North Midland Road Board for maintenance of main roads is to be spent on the Farrell’s Flat-Booborowie-Stone Hut road, even though it is the main feeder to the Farrell’s Flat Railway Station, which has more wheat traffic than any other station.]

Kooringa, 15 December.

Changeable weather has halted reaping.

John Roach has built a spacious wheat store next to his mill.

Hacket Coulthurst, the Negro elocutionist, gave two entertainments in the Institute Hall on Friday and Saturday evenings. Audiences were scanty, but he gave zealous performances.

Sir Henry Ayers.

C.B.T. writes in defence of Sir Henry Ayers.

It is fashionable to accuse Sir Henry Ayers of being selfish, obstinate, disappointed and non-progressive.

But it is easy to prove he has always respected public opinion, and has generally placed himself in the front to support the demands of the people. Take one instance:

‘Ten years ago Sir Henry Ayers was denounced by the squatters and others in their behalf, as well as by many others on behalf of Banks, absentees, and capitalists, as no other public man in this colony has ever been denounced on a question of public policy. True, he had five-sixths of the people with him as regards the policy he was then endeavouring to carry out; but an active, intelligent minority opposed him, and an influential portion of the Press also opposed him, and the consequence was that day by day and inch by inch he had to fight the battle out.

The policy Sir Henry Ayers then advocated, and which these gentlemen then opposed, was the taxing of the rich and the taking from them for ever the monopoly of our landed estate – a monopoly which some of our ablest and most highly-respected squatters (including, I believe, Mr Hawker) believed and declared they held of right and by agreement in perpetuity.

It is not too much to say that the policy and action of Sir Henry Ayers and the late Hon. John Barrows in those days formed the foundation and cleared the way for the first land reform and for every subsequent one. And following this up, the same gentleman carried the Land Bill sanctioning substituted residence against an able and powerful opposition, who were in favour of residence pure and simple. I was then and I am still a firm believer in personal residence as being the best system to exclude the dummy; but the fact remains that the success of the Areas is largely, nay principally, owing to the too liberal policy and energetic action of Sir Henry Ayers.

Under the circumstances it is not gratifying to find that his services in this direction are entirely unrecognised by the farmers; but is this really the case?’

28 December 1875, page 5

‘Vox Populi’ writes in response to C.B.T. re Sir Henry Ayers.

He says the very example cited in support of Sir Henry hardly adds to his credit.

The writer says: ‘I have come to the conclusion that he has always been a waiter upon other people’s enterprise, having as far as is publicly known never done anything to assist in developing the resources of South Australia, so also in politics he is a waiter upon other people’s ideas.’

It is true he took a prominent part in bringing about what are known as Goyder’s valuations, but he was led by a very much more able man in J.H. Barrow. It is also acknowledged that the enforcement of those valuations was disastrous. Not only did they ruin the prospects of the most important interests of the colony, but they also produced a strong reaction, in consequence of which the squatters were allowed their runs on long leases, on improved conditions at about half their value. In some years this meant a loss to SA of at least £40,000 – and some leases have many years to run.

‘The fact is Sir H. Ayers is a most painstakingly methodical man, very useful in formalities and comparatively small matters, ... but, like most men of detail, he is deficient in any work requiring originality of thought or boldness of conception, and as a statesman capable of initiating any policy suited to the wants of a young and growing colony with great resources like this he is a complete failure. The one thing his friend C.T.B. gives him credit for was undertaken with eyes shut, and with little or no thought as to the consequences.’

Kooringa Municipal Matters

A meeting of at least 150 ratepayers was held at the Burra Institute on Wednesday 29 December to consider the desirability of forming the district into a municipality. Captain Sanders presided in the absence of Captain Killicoat.

P. Lane said he had called the ratepayers together as a consequence of the place being proclaimed a Rabbit District. This was unfair to the townspeople who would have to pay two-thirds of the rate and reap no benefit from it.

O. Harvey proposed that the time had come when the township should form themselves into a Corporation. He was sure no one could gainsay this after looking at the town. It was as dirty as any in the colony. It should have happened years ago and was now a disgrace.

Joseph Beaglehole was opposed. They would be better off with a District and Rabbit rate that with a Corporation without any knowledge of its cost.

R. Ward seconded the motion. Several other residents spoke in support and then W.R. Ridgway moved an amendment deferring any movement towards a Corporation (and union of the various townships) until the Government had dealt with memorials proposing local government for the northern townships of the district.

Kooringa should leave the other townships alone and not try to drag them into a union which they should oppose.

Mr G. Woerner seconded.

Mr J. Sampson Jnr moved a further amendment that the meeting adjourn for a week so that the ratepayers could coolly consider the matter. J. Beaglehole seconded and when put this amendment was lost by a large majority.

Mr Ridgway’s amendment was lost by about 4 to 96.

The motion was then carried 100 to 6.

O. Harvey then proposed the Corporation should include the townships of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, Hampton, Llwchyr, Millerton, Roachtown, Nelson, Graham and The Mines.

Seconded by J. Jenkins and carried.

An amendment by Mr W.R. Ridgway seconded by Mr Voerner [sic] to strike out all the towns except Kooringa was lost, as was an attempt by J. Sampson Jnr to refer the question to a committee.

A committee to see to the implementing of the resolution was established: Messrs O. Harvey, C. Lowe, J. Roberts, E. Lipsett, T.W. Wilkinson, John Drew, H. Dawson, J. Tiver, A. Bartholomæus and John Jenkin.

The Rabbit Nuisance. An example of the rabbit problem is cited from the Eudunda area. W. Davidson came to the area in 1874 and leased some of Mr White’s land for five years. He planted 17 bags of wheat and as the crop grew it appeared likely to yield 1,000 bushels. But then the rabbits appeared and he killed 6,000 to 7,000 of them. In return they ate the crop and he ended up harvesting just 15 bags of grain. Davidson then gave up and sold the lease back to Mr White for £70. The Hundreds of Julia Creek, Neales and Apoinga are to be declared Rabbit Districts, but we doubt if the provisions of the Act are sufficient to meet the requirements of the cases.

Kooringa, 4 January.

On Christmas Day the Primitive Methodists held anniversary tea and public meetings in aid of their Sunday school. They were largely attended and the proceeds were satisfactory.

On Monday &amp; Tuesday [27 &amp; 28 December] the weather prevented any outdoor amusements, but the Burra Amateur Christy Minstrels gave an entertainment at the Burra Hotel Assembly Rooms, assisted by the local brass band. Attendances were good. The performances closed with a burlesque on ventriloquism and the Japanese Band. Tuesday’s entertainment aided the poor of the district.

On Monday [3 January] there was a holiday instead of on Saturday and the annual Wesleyan Sunday school picnic took place at Princess Royal. The weather was ideal and a large gathering set out bent on enjoyment. Over 1,000 persons including children visited the grounds during the day. Eight wagons of the SA Carrying Co. took the children. Some of the visitors played cricket, while others did a service to Mr McCulloch by killing rabbits.

Fire at Kooringa. Mr T. Clark’s chaff-house was found to be alight at about 2.15 a.m. on 13 January. The roof was well alight before any assistance was to hand and so the premises were burnt to the ground. Five tons of hay was destroyed and a large chaff-cutter was damaged. The fire-engine from the Burra Mine was quickly on the spot and rendered valuable assistance.

Inquest into Fire at Kooringa. J.D. Cave JP conducted an inquest on 19 January into the fire at Mr T. Clark’s chaff-house.

Thomas Clark, teamster of Kooringa, said he had been cutting chaff on Wednesday afternoon and had left at 5.30 p.m. and had not seen the place until he was told it was alight. The roof was alight when he got there and fell in about half an hour later. Neither he nor his man smoked there. The place contained five tons of hay, 20 or 30 empty bags, various tools and a new chaffcutter. The hay was perfectly dry. His stepson fed the horses about 10 o’clock. He suspected arson, but did not suspect anyone. The place was uninsured. The end of the building near the yards was made of upright dry mallee sticks and the walls were of stone.

Thomas Bewley, labourer, said he had been cutting chaff on Wednesday and left between 5 &amp; 6 when everything was alright. He always went into the house to smoke. Benjamin Newman, teamster and stepson of Mr Clark, confirmed feeding the horses and said he carried a close glass lantern and did not set it down, but let it swing from a rafter about 4 ft 6 inches from the paling roof. His mother woke him about 2.15 a.m. to say the shed was on fire. Two thirds of the shed was alight. He too believed the cause was arson, but had no suspects.

John Shortridge, clerk, said he saw no sign of fire when he passed the premises about 1.30 a.m. He was not smoking. Elizabeth Shortridge said she passed Mr Clark’s about 1 a.m. and saw no sign of fire. After her son came home she heard a person run past the house and went out, thinking it some person at the wood, as some had been stolen lately. She saw someone cross the bridge and run along the road as fast as he could towards the cemetery. The alarm about the fire was raised about 20 minutes later. The person running was either in shirt sleeves or a light coat and he came from the same road as Mr Clark’s and not from the Grammar School.

William Young, grocer’s assistant, said that at about 2.20 a.m. on Thursday morning he was standing opposite Mr Batchelor’s premises in Commercial Street with T. Shortridge Jnr when he saw the fire break out. They ran as fast as they could, calling out- Fire! The shed appeared to be all ablaze. Woke Mr Clark and family. There was no chance of putting out the fire. He had been standing in Commercial Street for about ten minutes and the only person he saw was J. Beaglehole going for Dr Nesbitt.

The jury found it impossible to determine whether the fire was the result of an accident or the work of an incendiary.

Serious Accident on the Northern Railway

Three persons died in an accident on the Northern Railway on Wednesday morning 9 February: Jonathan Wright, engine driver, John Warren, stoker and William Holmes, ganger.

The catastrophe happened to a goods train that left Burra station at 5.30 a.m. It proceeded to Peak’s Crossing about four miles south of Burra where a creek passes under the permanent way. The creek was swollen by rain from a thunderstorm the previous night. It overflowed and washed away some of the foundations of the bridge and made three breaches in the embankment. When the train reached the first undermined section the line gave way and the engine fell with the tender and following trucks piling themselves on top of it and on the bodies of the three deceased. The first information reached Adelaide at 9 a.m. from Farrell’s Flat. It was forwarded by the guard, George Gitsham of Gawler, who had driven to Farrell’s Flat after the accident. The flood had cut communications south from Burra. A telegram soon after noon stated that the engine was much damaged with the tender and trucks on top of it and that the bodies of the deceased were visible, but could not then be extricated. Arrangements were being made to clear the line as soon as possible.

Mr Mais, Manager of Railways and Mr Calf, Superintendent of Traffic went to the scene by special train, leaving Adelaide at 10.30 a.m. They spent the day supervision action at the scene. An engine with lifting equipment left Riverton early in the morning. We understand the three deceased were Riverton men. Wright was married, aged 31 and had been in the service 6 years. The stoker was single and aged about 24. Holmes was aged 56 and was a widower. At the time of the accident he was riding on the engine to reach the scene of his work. It was at first feared the guard was also dead, but he followed instructions and returned to Burra to stop the passenger train. The interruption to the telegraph prevented news of him arriving till later in the day. The train normally consists of 13-16 trucks and in this case was long enough to save the guard.

[SA Deaths CD registers the deaths as:

Jonathan Wright died 9 February 1876 at Peak’s Crossing, residence Redruth aged 35.

John Warren died 9 February 1876 Peak’s Crossing, residence Aberdeen aged 27.

William Holmes died 9 February 1876 Peak’s Crossing, residence Aberdeen aged 56.]

Particulars from a special correspondent telegraphed from Riverton midnight 9 February.

The rail traffic has been disarranged by the accident. I arrived at Riverton shortly before 5 p.m. by goods train, expecting it to go on, but the engine had to return and I had to await the passenger service. I went to Mintaro where I met Mr Mais, the Engineer-in-Chief, and returned with him by the return train, getting the following information from him.

[The report then repeats the information in the editorial comment to the point where the guard left the scene.]

Having survived the accident, the guard got a horse and vehicle from a nearby farm and drove to Burra expecting to telegraph details of the accident to Adelaide, but the floods had disrupted communications and this was not possible. He stopped the 8 a.m. passenger train. He returned to the accident and then walked down the line to Davistown [i.e. Davies, the present day Hanson] and from there with another man went to Farrell’s Flat by railway trolly. From there the news was telegraphed to Riverton and Adelaide. A number of men were despatched from Riverton and some 60 or 70 have been working all day to clear the wreckage sufficiently to recover the bodies. It was not until about 7 p.m. that Wright’s body was removed. His body was in perfect condition, but embedded in sleepers, rubbish and coal. The other two bodies were badly mutilated, having been caught between the engine and the tender.

The accident was caused through neglect of duty. Regulations provide that the line must be walked along every morning before the first train starts. This was not done. The man whose duty it was to walk the four miles south of Burra Station was at Burra at 5 a.m. and asked Holmes if he should proceed. Holmes said ‘No; I am going down myself.’ Holmes was the chief ganger at that end.

It will probably take a week to restore the track. A bridge will be built in the gap, as the cheapest was of effecting repairs. Passenger trains will run as usual, as there are engines and carriages on the Burra side of the break. The cost of the damage cannot yet be estimated. The engine and tender can probably be repaired for £1,500 or £1,600, but there is also damage to trucks and the Government will have to pay compensation for the lost wheat.

A sad aspect of the event is that one of Wright’s children is dying and he was up the greater part of Tuesday night with it. The bodies have been taken to Kooringa to await the inquest by J.D. Cave.

[I have not been able to find this death on SA Deaths CD.]

The telegraph line between Burra and Clare had also been washed away.

Mr Mais arrived in Adelaide by train 2.15a.m. Thursday morning and Mr Calf followed later in a special. Officials on the latter train added some details. They said the chasm at the scene was 40 or 50 ft wide and the bodies were badly mutilated and also burnt by the engine fire, which had to be extinguished some hours after the accident. Hundreds of people have come out from Burra, many to assist in the clearing of the line, but many more as spectators of the tragedy. It is said that the train was only travelling at 7 m.p.h. when the accident occurred.

The Recent Railway Accident: Editorial Comment

The enquiry into the recent accident was held at Kooringa on 10 February. The evidence points clearly to the conclusion reached by the jury: that the accident was due to the neglect of specific rules, which have been framed for the daily inspection of the track before a train passes over it. As for the specific portion of track involved; it needed special attention due to the soft nature of the soil used in the embankment. Added to that the geography of the country is such as to create the probability of damage in the event of heavy rainfall, such as occurred on Tuesday night. The evidence of James Peak was that flood as great as that of Tuesday had occurred before, but in the absence of hail the culvert had not been blocked and the embankment had not been damaged. The loose nature of the embankment was known to the driver and the guard and it seems strange that this information was not conveyed to the Engineer-in-Chief. Perhaps if ganger Navin had reported the flood of last year, even though it had not caused damage, greater precautions would have been taken in travelling over the embankment. The immediate cause was the failure to walk the line before the train passed. The need for such inspections was evident on the very morning of the accident on the section south of where it occurred. Ganger McKenzie noticed a slip, which was then remedied before the passenger train was due.

Mr Mais cited section 6 clause 23 that requires inspection every morning before the first train.

Henry Branford, Inspector of the Permanent Way between Roseworthy and Burra referred to a memorandum, signed by Mr Patterson, of 10 April 1874 limiting the need for such to winter months. In October 1874 Branford circulated gangers requesting them to discontinue early inspection of the lines in the summer months. No provision was made for action in exceptional circumstances, such as after heavy rainfall.

We believe, however, that the regulations cited by Mr Mais were issued after the Patterson memorandum and that they superseded and cancelled any former rules with which they were inconsistent. Yet Branford states, strangely enough, that he considered Patterson’s order took precedence over regulations issued 12 months later.

We concur with the conclusion of the jury that the action of Mr Branford is highly censurable, and is the direct cause of the accident.

In contrast the prompt actions of the guard George Gitsham are much to be commended.

We do not know what further steps may be taken, but the matter ought not to be allowed to rest where it is.

Visit to the scene of the recent railway accident at Peak’s Crossing by our special reporter.

Burra 10 February

I visited the scene this morning by means of the special train provided by Mr Mais, and met the coroner and jury there; they having gone to view the wreck. The country from Farrell’s Flat on showed evidence of heavy rainfall. The propensity of the area to flood was noted when the railway was constructed and 13 additional culverts were added between Farrell’s Flat and Burra. The effects of the hailstorm were apparent in the area. Straw and hail were mixed and piled up in heaps; some of which were still a couple of feet high. Around the scene of the accident the heaps were larger still and the hailstones as big as cherries. The water lying about was one to two feet deep. The first breach on the Adelaide side was a small one and then came the culvert. The earth all round has been loosened and in places the abutments are quite bared. Except where the accident occurred the rails are still hanging and the rails and sleepers formed a tolerably firm suspension bridge over which we walked. Fifty feet further on was the smash. The engine lay as it had fallen, with its nose embedded in the opposite bank. The tender has been pulled up on end and the trucks which ran on top of it have both been thrown aside. Almost everything has been completely smashed. Perhaps the body of the engine may be used again and parts of the tender, but all the trucks, but one are useless. Wheat had been scattered over the ground to a depth of two or three feet. Sixty or seventy men are still at work in removing the wreckage.

I have since learnt that Gitsham saved the four end trucks from going over by working the brake in his van. The train was going down an incline at slow speed when the accident occurred.

The Peak’s Crossing Accident Inquest

J.D. Cave JP was the coroner and Henry Dawson was Jury Foreman.

George Gitsham , guard, said the train started two minutes late at 5.32 a.m. and was started in the usual manner and according to regulations.

John Rumball, the stationmaster, heard the train depart as usual just after 5.30 a.m.

Gitsham said the first indication of the accident was a shock to the train at the 97th mile post. He was standing on a seat looking out the window and knowing the looseness of the embankment was expecting a signal. He heard a loud splash and saw the trucks toppling over and disappearing one after another. He had received no signal for the brake. He put down the brake hard and so saved the last four trucks and the brake van. He got out of the van and went to see to his mates. He could not see them for the steam from the engine. He thought the first culvert had been washed away. He saw the engine and the tender and the fore part of the train were in the chasm all smashed up. He walked a mile and a half to a get a conveyance and reported the accident at the Burra Station at 6.30 a.m. The accident had happened at 5.51 a.m. He had followed his instructions under regulations in returning to the station to secure assistance. The stationmaster had sent a special engine to the scene at 7.20 a.m. and he returned with it. He then found the engine buried with ten trucks in an opening in the embankment about a chain north of the culvert, which had been caused by the flood. A stream of water was running through the opening and there was a large mass of hail and stubble lodged against the embankment. Had the ganger walked this part of the line before the train it would have prevented the accident. Walking the line had been knocked off recently, though they had previously done so. He had never reported what he knew of the looseness of the embankment, but the Permanent Way Inspector would have observed it. The previous night had been very rough. Holmes normally rode in the guard’s van, but he supposed he was on the engine as a look-out because of the rough weather. Holmes had been the Walking Inspector of the Permanent Way from Burra to Riverton and it was his duty to see whether anything was wrong with the line.

John Rumball said Gitsham had reported the accident at 6.3[0] a.m. He sent for a doctor and ordered a special train be got ready. Tried to telegraph to Adelaide, but the line was down. It was nearly 7 a.m. when he started for the accident with as many men as he could muster. On arrival he could see the back of Holme’s head and another man’s face, but could not recognise him on account of the face being parboiled by steam and hot water.

He sent Gitsham on to Farrell’s Flat to communicate with Adelaide, put out the engine fire and sent a man down the line with a danger flag. [He then described the scene as has previously been set out.]

Henry C. Mais, Engineer-in-Chief and Manager of SAR produced a copy of the rules and regulations.

[He also described the scene. He believed one reason for the collapse of the embankment was the nature of the material, but that was inevitable; it was necessary to use what was available. In other places the water had flowed over the rails, depositing debris on the top, but not causing damage to the permanent way. Had the culvert not been blocked up he believed it would have been capable of carrying away all ordinary storm waters.

The last body had not been removed till 7 p.m. The body of the driver was in an almost vertical position among a lot of wheat and debris, but did not appear much bruised. Homes was leaning out as if he had been looking ahead and thus doing his duty. The fireman had hold of the steam-regulator. The appearance of ballast above the chasm no doubt led them to believe the line was all right.

The duty of walking the line was performed at the lower end and he had not been aware until yesterday that it was not done up to the present time.

[Mais then outlined the regulations requiring the walking of the line.]

Branford was the Inspector of the Permanent Way and responsible for keeping this section of line in good order.

Mais had never received any report casting doubts on the safety of the embankment. It was not Home’s duty to walk the line, but that of the men under him. He had no idea the embankment was unsound. The watermark on the telegraph poles was 12 ft high.

William Navin, ganger, said he was aware of the regulations re walking the line. On the morning of the accident Mr Holmes had asked who was to walk the line. He said it was Thomas Roach’s turn; each man of the gang walking it in turn. It was the custom to walk the line after the first goods train had passed. This was because of instructions from Mr Branford in the previous September who said that the goods train driver and stoker had sufficient light to see any danger. After that the line had always been inspected after the first goods had passed. He had worked the line since its construction and had never known the culvert unable to carry away water, though he had observed the watermark above the line after heavy rains, but it had done no harm.

Patrick Roach said he recalled Navin reading out the instruction from Mr Branford.

He had received 7/6 a month for walking the line when it was in operation.

Henry Branford produced the instruction re ceasing to walk the line as requested by himself and endorsed by R.C. Patterson, Chief Assistant Engineer.

The change was because the driver and fireman had sufficient light; it was not about saving money.

He considered it possible the accident could have been averted if men had walked the line, but it was not a certainty. The breach would have been discovered, but the men might not have been able to stop the train.

[Much more detail around this matter is printed.]

He did not consider the embankment unsafe. Never knew the water high enough to endanger it. Several reports had said the bank was settling, but Mr Homes had never reported it unsafe. Gitsham had similarly reported settling without saying it was unsafe.

John Peak, licensed victualler, said he had lived near the crossing for 15 years. He had seen similar floods before the railway was constructed and since the culvert was in place, but had never seen the culvert obstructed.

John McKenzie, ganger, gave further corroborative evidence on walking the line and further details on the slip on his section of the line.

William Navin on being recalled said he had never received any instruction on walking the line after bad weather.

Constable Francis Bennett gave evidence of proceeding to the scene and of taking charge of the bodies when they had been extricated.

Christopher Provis, corporal of police at Clare arrived at the scene at about 5.30 p.m. and gave evidence of the removal of Wright’s body.

The coroner in summing up said he had no doubt that the accident was caused through the want of care of attention on the part of someone and a failure to follow the printed rules and regulations. It appeared that Mr Mais was under the impression that they were being enforced. It seemed clear that if the line had been walked on that morning the accident would have been avoided and three lives and a valuable amount of property would have been saved. The question then was who had infringed the rules and by whose authority? The jury had heard the evidence of Navin that Mr Branford had given written instructions to discontinue walking the line. The evidence showed that the practice was discontinued and Mr Branford did not deny giving the order.

In the coroner’s view Mr Branford’s instructions were the primary cause of the accident. The guard had given clear evidence and had used every caution and carried out his instructions to the letter.

His opinion was that Mr Branford’s instructions were the cause of the accident. He could not compliment Mr Branford on his evidence; he had fenced questions whenever he could.

It was for the jury to say whether Branford had so acted as to lay himself open to the charge of manslaughter. If they acquitted him of that charge, he thought they would be of the opinion he was greatly responsible for the terrible catastrophe which had occurred.

The jury retired for 40 minutes and then returned.

They found that the deaths were caused by the train falling into a chasm caused by the flood and that the breach of the line had not been observed by any officials of the line because the patrol of the line was ordered discontinued by direction of the Inspector of the Permanent Way, Mr Henry Branford, without authority or cognizance of the Manager of Railways, as head of his department; and that the action of Mr Branford in that respect is highly censurable, and is the direct cause of the accident.

The coroner also thanked Corporal Provis on behalf of the jury for the excellent way in which he had conducted proceedings and examined the witnesses. The jury also expressed their commendations to the guard George Gitsham for his conduct during the accident. His quickness of mind and prompt action not only saved his own life, but also a quantity of valuable merchandise. His following adherence to the rules of the railways was deserving of very great praise.

12 February 1873, page 5

The late Railway accident at Peak’s Crossing

Memorandum of James P. Boucaut, Commissioner of Public Works:

I have carefully read over the printed reports of the coroner’s inquest and have gone through the same line by line with the Engineer-in-Chief, who has thoroughly gone through the causes of the accident and who attended the inquest. The accident is to be attributed to the absence of the inspection of the line by the walking ganger in accordance with the regulations. This neglect is a direct consequence of the circular issued by Branford directing ganger not to walk the line. This circular was not authorised by any superior authority and was not reported by Branford. It was subject to those objections under the old regulations and directly contrary to the new regulations of 24 September 1875. On receipt of these regulations Branford should have revoked the circulare, even if he had the impression it was authorised under the old regulations (however erroneous that impression may have been). Consequently there is no alternative but for the Engineer-in-Chief to recommend and for me to concur in the immediate dismissal of Inspector Branford, who is therefore dismissed accordingly. It is with regret that this necessity is pursued with respect to a public servant who has faithfully discharged his duties for a period of 20 years.

The editor was glad to see that Mr Boucaut had acted so promptly and agreed that this was the only possibly outcome. He felt, however, that the results of the accident must be a terrible and enduring punishment to any sensitive man. He went on to suggest that a suitable job might be found for him with less responsibility without demoralizing the public service or weakening the rule of regulations. Justice is apt to be severe in instances where a scapegoat can be found upon whom public indignation can be poured.

The Recent Flooding

Evidence of the severity of the flooding from the storm which washed away the railway embankment at Peak’s Crossing can be seen from Burra to Clare. On Mr Roger’s farm at Gum Creek the creek rose and almost submerged full-grown almond trees. It stripped away the top soil completely in places. A considerable number of persons continue to visit the scene of the railway disaster.

The Northern Argus reports that on Tuesday evening over the Burra area an electric storm with continuous lightning broke out about midnight and the rain began towards 2 a.m., soon causing creeks to overflow. Water rushed down the principal street in Kooringa two to three feet deep. Most houses are higher than the street, but a number were flooded. At Gum Creek the water rose to unusual heights. A corner of Mr Davis’s house there was washed away when the water rose higher than he had seen in 20 years. Early on Wednesday morning a terrific thunderstorm also passed over Clare, depositing heavy rain. It continued without a break for three hours. Clare residents feared a flood, but the downpour totalled only 0.8 inches.

Consequences of the Railway Accident

Until the railway line can be repaired no wheat will be sent south from Burra. Merchandise bound for Burra and nearby towns will be unloaded near the accident scene and transferred to SA Carrying Co. trollies so that the town will not be without supplies. The mails are being treated similarly. A temporary wooden bridge will be erected at the site of the accident. It will eventually be replaced by an iron girder span of about 25 ft. J.C.B. Moncrieff of the Railway Department has been sent to supervise the work. He is being assisted for a day or two by Mr Puddy, the Inspector of the Permanent Way. The passenger service is continuing as usual, though of course there is a slight delay at Peak’s Crossing due to the necessity of changing trains.

12 February 1873, page 6

Henry Williams Jnr writes hoping that the recent accident at Peak’s Crossing will cause the railways and the Government to rethink the whole issue of constructing flimsy embankments. This he says he has not seen in Great Britain, Europe or America. A site such as the one at the accident requires iron girders supported on properly cemented stone arches.

17 February 1876, page 5

The Railway Accident

Due to the diligence of the workers at the scene the line was restored by Monday and on Tuesday the goods and passenger traffic was able to carry on as usual. At the large gap where the accident occurred the line is carried on a temporary wooden bridge of heavy timbers supported by substantial struts. An iron bridge will eventually relace this. The other breaches in the embankment have been repaired with the use of heavy timber and filling with earth.

18 February 1876, page 5

A Correction. A telegram in the Register on 11 February stated that Mrs Gordon, the wife of a shepherd on Mr J. Baggs’ run on the Eastern Plains had been lost in the bush with her child. Mr J. Baggs’ Jnr wishes us to correct the statement that in consequence of there being no food at Gordon’s hut the search party organised by Trooper O’Brien of Redruth had returned. He says that in addition to their being plenty of food there for man and beast, there was plenty of water and mutton available at Mr Cowper’s station about five miles distant. We have, he says spared no effort or expense in trying to find Mrs Gordon and her infant. It is hard enough to bear the lack of success in that search without the odium of not having of having occasioned their loss by any neglect on our part.

[The editor says that the telegram did not assert that the shepherd was not properly provided for, but the information they obtained was from the trooper, who we presume was not aware that the stores mentioned by Mr Baggs were in the hut and easily accessible.

19 February 1876, page 5

SAR. We understand that Mr Puddy, the Inspector of Permanent Way at the southern end of the Northern Railways, has been suspended. As the case is under investigation, we refrain from giving any particulars at present. We also learn that Mr Branford, the other Inspector of Permanent Way, has not been dismissed from the service, but only from the position he formerly held. He is employed as a ganger on the Northern Railway.

Obituary/Inquest. G.W. Goodhart JP held an inquest on 24 February on the deaths of Emma Gordon aged 32 and Alice Gertrude Gordon aged 5 who were lost in the scrub on the Eastern Plains about three weeks ago.

Charles Hailes, a boundary rider, worked for Mr Cowper and lived about five miles from the Gordons’ hut. He last saw them three weeks ago when he had dinner with them. Mr Gordon was absent. The family was well supplied with water and had a bag and a half of flour, a bag of sugar and a small piece of meat. He believed the hut had every requisite. Mrs Gordon promised to come to his hut on Monday and stay with his wife as his child was ill and he was going into Burra for a doctor. She had never walked to his hut before, but had walked from his hut to hers. They could see each other’s houses on a clear morning. Deceased was a weakly woman and walked rather lame. A fortnight ago last Saturday he went to the hut and found a note tied to the door saying:

Charley – Mrs Gordon is not here; I fear she is lost; help me if you can.’

Searched for a fortnight and found her on the 20 February. Gordon found a nightdress on the first Monday.

Every person available did his best in the search. There were four men from North-West Bend, two from T. Warnes’s and Messrs W. Lambert, H. Green, Phillis, Y. Bosance, W. Schultz, two troopers, Gordon and himself.

It was scrubby country and difficult to find the bodies. They had passed within 500 or 600 yards of them and found them when they came right upon them. The mother was about six feet from the child and the dog was lying on the child’s clothes. It was only possible to identify the bodies from the clothes. He could not say how long Gordon was away, but he thought about ten days.

Frank Gordon, boundary rider, employed by Mr Baggs of the Eastern Plains said he left his wife on a Friday at about 5 a.m. and was away ten days. He was taking sheep from the station to Springbank. He stopped at F. Baggs’ place with the sheep until Sunday., came into Burra to give notice to Mr Coglin, stayed two hours and went on to Springbank. The following Sunday he went back to the hut and wondered at his child not coming out to greet him. He thought they could be out picking flowers, but after half an hour became concerned. He had told Bowman to call and see his wife as she was timid and he came to the conclusion she had gone with Bowman. After searching for tracks he went to his hut and left notes for Bowman and Hailes.

[He recounted searching and finding the child’s nightdress and then of finding the bodies on the second Monday.]

He believed she had no reason to leave the hut except to go to Hailes’ and believed she had been going there when she missed the way. Everything was in order at the hut and there was no sign anybody had been there. He could not see the bodies until very close to them. They appeared to have died peacefully. His wife had never said she would lose herself in the bush and they had parted on good terms.

Mr Sowerby of Kooringa said he was searching five days and he thought every assistance was rendered.

The jury returned a verdict of accidental death through starvation and exposure.

[Emma Gordon died 2 February 1876 Eastern Plains aged 33 and Alice Gertrude Gordon died 2 February 1876 Eastern Plains aged 5. The child does not appear in SA Births CD and the marriage does not appear in SA Marriages CD.]

A Brawl at Hanson [i.e. Farrell’s Flat]

The Northern Argus reports a brawl at Hanson on 19 February involving about 20 or more men. No one seems sure how it started, but the combatants were teamsters on one side and wheat lumpers employed at the station on the other. A wager about carrying a bag of wheat 400 yards had something to do with it. The teamsters were mainly Irish and had imbibed quite freely. After they had exhausted themselves they adjourned to the pub for refreshment.

Burra Harvest Festival was celebrated on Sunday 29 February.

At St Mary’s Rev. H. Howitt conducted the services.

The Primitive Methodists and the Bible Christians assembled with the Wesleyans in their chapel and the service there was conducted by Revs S. Gray, T. Hillman and G. W. Patchell. In the afternoon a picnic was held in R. Austin’s paddock about a mile and a half from Kooringa. The weather was favourable and about 1,000 attended. The Burra Brass Band enlivened the occasion. Athletic sports were contested with W.F. Coglin as judge:

200 yards Young Men’s Race H.A. Holthouse

100 yards Boys’ Race S. Raymond

100 yards Girls’ Race Misses Murphy &amp; Lock tied – sharing the prize of a 14 lb tin of lollies.

50 yards pickaback race Hopkins &amp; Fitzgerald

Jumping in Sacks R. Hopkins

Three-legged Race Brackenridge &amp; Moyle

Blindfolded Wheelbarrow Race J. Seymour

A cricket match was played with enthusiasm and a bat given to J. Martin as highest scorer and a ball to H. Ware as best bowler. The sports closed with a donkey race, and chasing the pig and a sheep.

In the evening there was a concert at the Institute Hall.

The proceeds will aid the Burra Hospital Fund.

Association of District Chairmen

The Saddleworth District Chairman convened a meeting to consider forming an Association of District Chairman for the Midland District as well as for nominating members for the Midland Road Board.

It was held 29 February at Riverton. Districts represented were Saddleworth, Upper Wakefield, Rhynie, Burra, Alma Plains, Hamilton, Hanson and Dalkey. Apologies were received from Gilbert and Julia Creek.

The Association was formed and Messrs Killicoat, Bowden &amp; R. Kelly were elected members of the Midland Road Board.

Kooringa, 1 March.

A complimentary dinner was given to W. Condon on Thursday evening. He was guard on the Blinman [coach] line for a number of years. B. Butterworth presided. He was presented with a watch on leaving the Blinman Line. [The various toasts are reported.]

Booborowie, 1 March.

The carters, having been paid for their season’s work have subscribed for and entered upon the repair of the worst places on the main road to Hanson [Farrell’s Flat] although the road is not properly defined. The local DC has also called tenders for putting into order three places on the main road.

The township is in good humour in consequence of having from 80-100 heavily loaded teams coming to it in one day. Carting has been completed on some farms so the next task of stubble burning has commenced. The fires as seen from the high hills at night are quite imposing. Sometimes there are fires on every side.

Most of the Government selectors in this district are fully able to buy their sections, the purchase-money for which will shortly fall due.

The Educational Wants of the Areas

J.A. Hartley, President of the Council of Education, will visit the Areas to ascertain their educational needs. On Tuesday 21 March he will leave Clare for Yacka and on Wednesday will visit Jamestown and Narridy. On Thursday he will go onto Rocky River and Crystal Brook and then by train to Port Pirie. On Friday he will return to Crystal Brook and thence to Gladstone and Laura. He will reach Wirrabara and Yarrowie on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday 27 March he hopes to be at Caltowie and Belalie East and the next day should reach Gottlieb’s Wells and Yarcowie, reaching Burra the same night. He will return to Adelaide on Wednesday. In several of the places mentioned applications have been made for schools and in others educational reserves have been declared. Soon Mr Hartley intends visiting the country west of Port Wakefield and Redhill.

Burra School Needs. Captain Killicoat, as Chairman of the District Council, has requested that Mr Hartley visit Kooringa with respect to assessing school needs, while on his present visit to the Areas. Mr Hartley has agreed to do so.

The Burra Mine

Captain Sanders reports good progress in sinking Morphett’s Shaft. About eight feet has been sunk in the past four weeks and more would have been achieved, but for the influx of water from the 70 north on new lode. This has necessitated fitting a larger lift at the 70. Four men are cutting plat on the north end of Morphett’s Shaft at the 70. This is necessary for starting a crosscut east to Tinline’s Lode and also to make the shaft available for hauling with skips; the former plat being on the engine side, rather than the hauling side of the shaft. At Waterhouse’s 60 the crosscut east is about 15 fathoms and letting out so much water that the men can do little. If Tinline’s Lode is cut at his level nearly all the water from the north part of the mine can be diverted through this crosscut. In Peacock’s Shaft, if the old plans are correct, we should have holed the 50 fathom level to the long crosscut from Ayer’s to Graves’. Work is pushing on; hoping to hole shortly. Sinking at Bunce’s is slow in hard ground. This shaft lies between two old deposits of ore and no ore is expected until the shaft reaches 22 fathoms, when crosscuts can be made to the lodes.

Kooringa, 28 March.

The weather continues dry and rain is needed for the continuation of ploughing.

The United Circus Co. gave performances before large and enthusiastic audiences on Friday and Saturday nights.

The district has been free from bush fires this season.

Valedictory Services were held at the Bible Christian Chapel on Sunday to farewell Rev. T. Hillman on the eve of his departure for Auburn. After tea on Monday Mr W. Davey Jnr was given a purse containing 10 guineas, as a mark of respect for his valuable services in playing the harmonium and in other ways helping to sustain the efficiency of his father’s singing class.

Strike at Waukaringa

H. Moserr, of Kooringa, informs us that on a recent visit to Waukaringa he was surprised to find work at the Alma Gold Claims was suspended. The Manager, Mr Gowen, informed him that most of the hands had refused to work following the appointment of Mr McCuffray as captain. The men then proceeded to the grogshop and then to the manager’s office, where they demanded instant settlement of their claims. The manager refused and Mr Gowen then had to protect himself with a revolver. Some then pelted the place with stones. The landlord and Mr Jackson, the storekeeper, tried unsuccessfully to pacify the men. Mr Jackson was knocked down and had to protect himself with firearms. The next day the mob demanded Jackson supply them with drink, threatening mischief if he did not. New men arrived on 27 March and the manager contrived with difficulty to get the battery operating. When the mail coach left for Burra about 25 of those making the disturbance went with it. Police protection was asked for, but not granted. The nearest police station is 25 miles away and the officer in charge was collecting census forms.

11 April 1876, page 5

Mr G. Hill, the late manager of the SA Carrying Co., was entertained at a complimentary dinner on Saturday 8 April at the Aberdeen Hotel. About 50 persons sat down to an excellent meal provided by Host Orchard. Captain Killicoat presided. [Some of those attending are listed and toasts are reported.] J.D. Cave said that it was three and a half years since Mr Hill first came amongst them, and he then thought him rather young to take such a position as the one he held. His abilities had been fully proved, as the situation he held was one of no ordinary difficulty. He had always under him numbers of people of all classes, and although a young man, was respected by them. He was wished well in his new position [which was not described]. Mr Thomas, an employee of the company, presented Mr Hill with a silver watch and gold chain.

Education at Burra. Mr Hartley, President of the Council of Education, inspected G.R. Lowe’s school at Redruth and F.W. Holder’s school at Kooringa on the 12 April and our correspondent reports that he saw the need for a first-class school at Burra.

Kooringa Roads. A meeting was held at the Institute on 10 April to consider the position of the Government road east from Kooringa. About 150 people attended. Messrs T. Warnes, P. Lane and R. Ward in a long discussion contended that the Midland Road Board had ignored the rights of the people and had not represented Kooringa in deciding to start the road from Tiver’s Corner in Aberdeen. It was contended that the line of road from Aberdeen was longer and would cost more.

P. Killicoat proposed that the road adopted by the Road Board be accepted. B. Preece seconded.

W. Pearce proposed an amendment that the road to the east from Kooringa as sanctioned by the Government be accepted. Seconded by J. Jenkin. The amendment was carried amidst cheering.

A Committee was established to petition the Government.

Harcus’s South Australia

William Harcus writes to inform the public that an edition of the work on South Australia is being published in England with maps and illustrations, and that edition, and not the one printed here, will be circulated in England and at the Philadelphia Exhibition.

Obituary/Inquest

J.D. Cave JP held an inquest at Farrell’s Flat on Thursday 18 April on the death of Patrick Butler of Canowie, who had died on the previous day.

Samuel Miller said that about 3 p.m. he and John Wilson had met the deceased about a mile from Hanson [Farrell’s Flat]. He asked them to assist him through the ‘gluepot’ with his team of horses and wagon loaded with wheat. Deceased was on the near side and the others on the offside. When partway through they heard a cry and immediately stopped the horses. The deceased was found jammed between the nearside hind wheel and a fencepost. Keogh and Boyd, who then came up, helped back up the horses, but it took half an hour to extricate Butler. Deceased was still alive when Miller went to report the accident.

John Wilson gave corroborative evidence. Alexander J. Boyd of Kooringa gave supporting evidence and said the deceased had died about half an hour after being extricated.

John Wilson said the deceased was quite sober and Police-trooper Davis said he found no intoxicating liquor on the wagon.

John Butler of Mt Lofty, son of the deceased, said his father was a farmer of Canowie Belt aged 60 and an experienced driver, used to horses. He considered the part of the road where the accident occurred to be very dangerous.

Police-trooper Davis said that on seeing the body, he found the leg severed below the knee.

The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.

[Patrick Butler died 12 April 1876 near Hanson, residence Canowie aged 63.]

15 April 1876, page 5

Education at Burra. It might perhaps be inferred from the visit of the President of the Council of Education, by people not knowing Kooringa, that Burra did not have a good public school. The defect is not in the institution, but in the building. F.W. Holder has about 50 pupils or more than the size of the room warrants and many more children are unable to attend because the teacher cannot cram them in without a danger to health.

Mr Hartley, Captain Killicoat, Mr P. Lane and Mr F.W. Holder examined the various sites proposed for a new structure and selected a suitable one, centrally located, with a desire to meet the wants of three townships.

Country Public Houses. A letter to the editor says that while there are many good country hotels, far too many are terrible and an efficient system of inspection is badly needed. Relying on the police is not a good system because circumstances often mean the police have to eat at hotels and the nature of their business also means they frequently need to develop a relationship with licensees in order to obtain information etc. This compromises their ability to also be inspectors of the premises.

All too often the only interest of the licensee is in the bar trade and accommodation for travellers and the travellers themselves are only seen as nuisances. There is often an absence of cleanliness in bedrooms, sitting rooms and table appointments. One does not penetrate the kitchens and it would be unwise to do so. The horses fare as badly, with dirty stables and poor provender. The ostler is too often merely a hanger-on from the bar, or a loafer picked up on the cheap. Closets are generally simply disease traps.

17 April 1876, page 6

The Far North Mails

‘Humanity’ writes from Sliding Rock.

[The letter is a very harsh condemnation of the way in which the mails are conveyed and the extreme cruelty inflicted on the horses employed. They are often in appalling condition, scarce able to move the vehicle and this compels the passengers to walk; the contractor refusing to refund any part of the fare in this case. Horses may be seen with skin dragged off by an ill-fitting collar, unshod and barely able to bear to place their feet on the ground. They are then left to find their own feed. [Specific instances are given.] After a lengthy description of the horrors inflicted upon the animals, the writer suggests that the Postmaster-General should stop accepting the lowest tender for the conveyance of mails and be more discriminating.

The SA Mining Association. Burra Mine

The 31st Annual Report has been submitted to shareholders. During the six months to 31 March the ore production reached 950 tons of 27% copper. This excellent result is due to the improvements in ore dressing. This is now so efficient that poor orey stuff can be properly treated and brought up to a high standard. It will be reassuring that the works for proving the mine at depth are now nearly half completed. They afford most promising expectations. While they have cost upwards of £7,000, the estimated cost has not been exceeded, and the funds available for their completion are adequate. The works have already led to valuable discoveries. The balance sheet for the half-year to 30 September 1975 shows that income nearly matched expenditure. There is a balance of unappropriated profit of £12,823. In the last six months there has been haulage of 43,200 tons and 35,520 tons of ore have passed through the machinery. Captain Sanders reports that the prospects of the deep workings exceed his expectations. Settlement is rapidly extending in the area around the mines and many additions and improvements have been made to buildings in the townships of Kooringa and Graham and many transactions in the leasing and selling of land therein have been entered into in the last half-year.

Mt Bryan East, 17 April

Farmers are sowing and ploughing.

A public meeting was held recently re the mail. The postal contracts will soon expire and it was thought a branch mail from Mt Bryan Flat Post Office would serve well without interrupting the present contractor.

It is generally thought that the Rabbit Act should have made it compulsory for the landowners to clear their land of these pests.

Many settlers think there should be another Hundred declared east of the Hundred of Hallett. Many would rather settle there than go further north. It would help present settlers by encouraging tradespeople to come to the area.

Kooringa, 19 April

The holidays have passed off quietly. The main recreations have been tea meetings associated with the various chapels.

Tea and Public meetings were held at the Primitive Methodist Chapel on Good Friday to welcome Rev. W. Jenkin. On Sunday and Monday he conducted the Anniversary Services.

The Wesleyan Sunday School Anniversary Services were conducted on Easter Sunday and Monday. Mr Minns from Adelaide preached on Sunday morning and evening. In the afternoon a Service of Song The Life of Elijah was held. On Monday afternoon the children had tea and cake and a public tea followed. Proceeds in all were £50.

The Church of England Sunday School children enjoyed their annual picnic at Mr McCulloch’s Princess Royal.

Thiodon’s Exhibition is at the Institute Hall. Attendances have been fair and the views have given general satisfaction.

25 April 1876, page 6

Booborowie, 19 April

Baldry people, after enjoying the benefits of having a post office, are now lamenting its loss.

The office was incautiously named Gum Creek. This annoyed those who had lived on the creek for 20 years and got their letters at Kooringa, but could not now know where they might be sent.

The delays and timing of the Blinman mail are also causes for complaint.

Young farmers here have either gone or are going to invest in a square mile block in the Hundred of Willowie.

Fire at the Bon Accord Hotel. A fire was discovered in one of the upper bedrooms at about 7 a.m. on Sunday 30 April. When Mr Wilson reached the room he found the bed a mass of flames. He threw the burning articles out of the window. There was plenty of water to hand and with assistance the fire was extinguished. Some of the floor and skirting boards were burnt. The cause is not known, but it is thought that a guest who left early might have forgotten to extinguish a candle.

Kooringa, 9 May

A crowded and successful entertainment was given on Friday evening at the Wesleyan Schoolroom at Redruth by ladies and gentlemen amateurs, assisted by A.H. Forder’s Choir. W.R. Ridgway presided.

[Performers and their acts are listed.]

O. Harvey, who is going further north, was presented with a handsome gold albert and locket on Saturday evening as a token of the esteem in which he is held in the district. P. Lane made the presentation, which was supplied by Mr H. Mosarr.

16 May 1876, page 7

Burra Mine, 13 May. Captain Sanders reports that in the past month work has been pushed forward in various parts of the mine. The usual amount of ore has been raised from the open cut and by tributers. Morphett’s Shaft has been sink a further 8 ft and that part of the lode still in the shaft has improved in appearance and value and black copper oxide has appeared. 70 north is producing some good stones of grey ore and a crosscut has been started to prove the appearance on each side. We are driving from Grave’s Shaft at the 50 to hole to the long crosscut and hope to do so in about a fortnight. Peacock’s Air Shaft is being repaired and sunk and four men are repairing the level towards this shaft at the 50 and another four are repairing the level at 50 fathoms from Peacock’s to Roach’s. Four men are clearing sand from the 60 north of Waterhouse’s in order to start a crosscut to Peacock’s Air Shaft. The ground in Bunce’s remains very hard. We are opening the incline tunnel to its proper breadth; 9 ft wide by 7 ft high. About 28 fathoms have been completed in the last month with 20 fathoms to go. The foundation for the steam hammer is laid and the hammer fixed. We hope to get it working in about a week.

20 May 1876, page 7

Kooringa, 17 May.

Steady rain has been general here and across the Eastern Plains where dams have been filled.

The building boom in Burra continues. Dr Stephens is building two rows of cottages in Aberdeen.

Property values are rising in Kooringa and old places are being repaired and renovated and new ones erected.

Mr Bruse’s new hotel, which faces the principal street, will be two storeys high and an ornament to the locality. [The Commercial Hotel]

Kooringa, 27 May

Redruth Wesleyan Chapel held Anniversary Services on Sunday at which J.D. Hill preached to large congregations. Tea and public meetings were held on the Queen’s Birthday and were well attended.

Rain is much needed. The last two days have been marked by dust and a dry, cutting wind.

A meeting was held at the Institute tonight to discuss the high prices charged by butchers for meat, but it was hastily arranged and matters were not prepared, so no definite results ensued.

At the Parliamentary Club on Tuesday F.W. Holder, the new Premier, outline matters to be brought before the Legislature. He spoke for about an hour and the address was regarded as an excellent piece of elocution.

10 June 1876, page 7

Kooringa, 8 June.

Bible Christian Sunday School Anniversary Services were preached on Whit-Sunday by Rev. J.A. Burns and Mr R. Dale. The congregations exceeded the capacity of the chapel. Monday was a holiday and the children marched around the town, headed by the band and then had tea and cake. The public meeting was well attended and the effort raised £50-11-8.

The Benson Troupe appeared at the Institute on Wednesday and this evening before good audiences.

14 June 1876, page 5

At the Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church special services were held on Sunday and Monday in aid of enlarging the Kooringa parsonage. Rev. H.J. Pope preached to large congregations. The public tea on Monday was well attended as was the following public meeting. £74 was raised.

20 June 1876, page 6

A Complimentary Banquet was given at the Saddleworth Institute on 19 June to the Members for Burra Messrs R. Rees &amp; W.B. Rounsevell, and members of the late ministry. Nearly 100 sat down to dinner.

[A number of those present are listed.]

Mount Bryan East, 19 June

Sowing is about finished and the early sown wheat is up, but not far forward. The season has been very dry.

We have had boisterous weather lately, and on Friday there was a heavy fall of snow and of snow, hail and rain mixed. The snow has not yet disappeared. It is charming in the morning to look at the snow clad hills, but it would be much pleasanter if there was less wind by three-quarters.

Grass is scanty and the late rain has not been sufficient to make it grow faster than the rabbits can eat it.

The Rabbit Acts needs to be made compulsory. A school and District Council are needed. The creek crossings need repairing.
