A biology pond will be constructed if suitable local quotes can be obtained. All gas, water and electrical services have now been connected to the Agricultural Laboratory.</p>
<p>School Crossing Signs will be installed on Smelts Road.</p>

<p>The Arts Council is sponsoring ‘Rock Factory’ – a student presentation at Burra Town Hall which will include examples of various Rock Music developments and an insight into how the pop music machine works.</p>
<p>Burra Burra DC has begun discussions with the Burra RSL with a view to establishing a Civic Centre in the RSL Building. As the RSL Building would become Council property in the event that the RSL ceased to function, it was felt that this was the logical site for the new Council home.</p>
<p>The efficient working of the Council has been hampered for many years due to the Council Chambers being so remote from the Office and now with the need for extra space to house the computer, Pest Plant Officer and for a spare office to accommodate visiting staff from Government Departments, auditors etc. the need is urgent.</p>
<p>Another factor is the need for a clinic for the Doctors. Research has found that the present Burra Burra District Council Office is the ideal site and size for the clinic. The opportunity has therefore been taken to negotiate its sale. When the Burra Mine was re-opened the royalties were set aside for purposes of this nature and relocation of the Council can be largely financed from this source and the sale of the existing offices.</p>
<p>The Council proposes to provide the RSL with better facilities than they now enjoy, for as long as they have the need and the Burra RSL have indicated their co-operation in the overall plan.</p>
<p>An architect has been commissioned to draw up plans and specifications for the new centre, so that Council can then call tenders. The Burra RSL Building would be transferred to Council at no cost to Council and this, it is anticipated, would represent a large cost saving to ratepayers over any alternative new facility in a less favourable location.</p>

<p>[Actually the paper began as ‘The Northern Mail’ 30 June 1876 until 29 December 1876.</p>
<p>It was ‘The Burra News and Northern Mail from 5 January 1877 to 28 June 1878.</p>
<p>From 5 July 1878 its masthead was ‘The Record – A paper for Burra and the North East’ until the first issue as ‘The Burra Record’ on 4 October 1878. It ceased publication with the issue of 8 March 1977.]</p>
<p>A set of the paper is held in the State Library’s Newspaper Department. The Newspaper Librarian Mr Len Marquis has expressed concern that since 1890 it was printed on wood pulp paper that is acidic and as a result the paper is becoming brittle and will eventually disintegrate. It is proposed to preserve it on 45 reels of microfilm and to this end an appeal is made now for funds to begin this process.</p>

<p>BCS Kooringa Building</p>
<p>Last Wednesday a small section of old ceiling plaster in the Kooringa building came adrift in the Years 2/3 Unit. The Public Buildings Department inspected the area and as a result from 20 August the 2/3 Classes have been using the Youth Club building. As the ceilings throughout the building are affected they will be completely removed and replaced with a new acoustic ceiling suspended at the height of the present slatted ceiling. This work will start as soon as possible – possibly as soon as the coming holidays. Dust and noise will probably mean the removal of the Reception and Years 1 &amp; 2 classes to the Catholic Parish Hall and the Annexe of the Agriculture Classrooms during the work. We anticipate that in due course the 3/4 and 5/6 Units will move to the same sites in their turn.</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study: A Summary</p>
<p>In 1977 the Burra Burra DC became increasingly aware of the importance of Burra, not only in terms of its history, but also the charm and beauty of its old stone buildings. They recognised the need to develop an overall plan to allow development without interfering with the town’s essential character. They applied for a grant for the purpose of a conservation study.</p>
<p>This was published in September 1978 and has been widely acclaimed and in part has been seen as a blueprint for other State Governments to use for their historic towns.</p>
<p>The study was done in two parts.</p>
<p>Part 1 was completed by Ian Auhl and Steve Gilbert. It identified the precincts of Burra, the important historic buildings and rated them in terms of their importance and need for preservation and made suggestions for their future.</p>
<p>Part 2 was completed by the firm of Lester, Firth and Murton. They worked with a steering committee comprising local people from the District Council, National Trust, Department of Urban and Regional Affairs and the Department of the Environment. The purpose of this part was to analyse the character of Burra and set objectives and policies to guide the future conservation and development of the town and prepare practical guidelines for specific areas of Burra itself.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks we will print selected portions from the study to give some idea of the importance of the study and the importance of Burra itself.</p>

<p>The Public Meeting of Ratepayers called for 26 September resulted in just six people attending plus the Chairman and five of the ten Councillors. Mrs E.V.M. Tiver writes deploring the apathy displayed. She believes: ‘&hellip;people should not complain if they are too apathetic to attend a meeting which gives an opportunity for ratepayers to express their concerns.’</p>

<p>A Public Meeting will be held at BCS, in the Redruth Building 18 October at 8 p.m. when Mr Roger Fordham will speak on ‘The Plight of the Refugee Families.’</p>
<p>Burra Conservation Study</p>
<p>In both parts of the study the town has been divided into precincts.</p>
<p>The names of the precincts are not intended to be divisive, merely convenient.</p>
<p>They do indicate a belief that such precincts have a distinctive character, whether that be architectural, natural, industrial or commercial. It has developed by historical circumstance.</p>
<p>Burra is a collection of originally separate townships, each with its own flavour and the mixture of these ‘flavours’ makes up the character of present day Burra.</p>
<p>A strong architectural link between the various precincts is the presence throughout of a large number of buildings erected in local stone. The unifying effect of this stone in public buildings, walls, kerbing, homes, mine structures and ruins cannot be over estimated. Structures unsympathetic to this characteristic of Burra or overpowering to such streetscapes or buildings should be discouraged.</p>
<p>Burra Town Hall interior has been repainted.</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study. Part 2 has seven sections.</p>
<p>Section I deals with the approach the authors are going to take.</p>
<p>Section II describes social and economic influences on Burra including location, population, employment, economy, facilities, community attitudes, etc.</p>
<p>Section III includes a heading Townscape</p>
<p>The architectural character of Burra is particularly diverse. There are contrasts of large and small, humble and affluent, timber and stone.</p>
<p>An early dugout phase was followed by simple Cornish cottages with straightforward hip roofs and chimneys, sited directly on the footpath with a central doorway and a room either side. Houses often stepped down the contours, which has provided interest and variety in many streets. Verandahs were an Australian feature added later, as in Paxton Square, to moderate the harshness of the climate.</p>
<p>The larger detached dwellings of elegant proportions made their appearance around the 1880s. Whit painted heads, sills and quoins contrasted with the darker stone and together with similar features of the major civic and public buildings of the late Victorian period, combine in a strong unifying theme of architectural style throughout Burra. The impact of unsympathetic modern brick and prefabricated buildings is small, but increasing. Their siting, scale and use of materials are eroding the historical character of some areas, including Taylor Street, Morehead Street and Chapel Street.</p>
<p>The Swimming Pool Committee annual meeting will be held on 2 November at BCS. A well-attended meeting is required to elect a new committee and to give support and guidance in organising the successful operation of our swimming pool.</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study. Part III</p>
<p>Section III. Heading: Open Space and vegetation</p>
<p>Four distinctive types of vegetation contribute to the overall character.</p>
<p>Tall stately River Red Gums (E. camaldulensis) along Burra Creek and the gums of Welsh Place, Paradise and Llwchwr Park Reserve and the Recreation Reserve provide a well treed ‘green’ character to the town, set against bare hills.</p>
<p>The gnarled pepper trees (Schinus molle) which occur throughout the town.</p>
<p>The tall pines along the Burra Creek adjacent to Paxton Square and in the Bon Accord Mine area add an additional distinctive quality.</p>
<p>There are notable exceptions where street trees have been removed, particularly in Market Square, where White Cedars once lined Commercial Street.</p>
<p>Street trees are effective in providing shade and shelter as well as contributing to the character of the street. Good examples are found in Chapel, Thames, Kingston, Queen and Morehead Streets and in Bridge Terrace.</p>
<p>The presence of overhead wires and past attitudes has led to severe cropping and stunted and unnatural appearance in places. Modern technology in urban services no longer places such a degree of importance on pruning and the practice should be discouraged.</p>
<p>BCS. The Deputy Principal Mr Adrian Kraft has been notified he has been promoted to Principal of Streaky Bay Area School and will take up his position early in 1980.</p>
<p>Refugee Awareness Meeting, 18 October.</p>
<p>This drew over 50 local people and the guest speaker was Mr Roger Fordham. Vietnamese people came from Adelaide and Auburn. Mr Fordham outlined the historical background to the Indo-China refugee problem and his own experience. He illustrated the talk with moving and disturbing pictures of the plight of refugees in camps. No firm or binding resolution was passed, but those present came to believe that this community was able to solve all the physical problems if refugee families decide they want to live here. A meeting to start initiating action will be held at BCS 30 October.</p>
<p>Paper Bag Theatre</p>
<p>Karel &amp; Eva Rehorek have a wealth of experience and have developed the novel approach of ‘Paper Bag Theatre’. They will visit Burra on 1 &amp; 2 November and will present:</p>

<p>Advertising</p>
<p>Burra Hotel is cited as a good example of traditional advertising style: upper case type, simple and bold, shaded to the right at 45°, well spaced, black on white background. So is the Burra Burra DC: simple and restrained use of capitals, black on white background.</p>
<p>Signs from 1850 to 1900 were primarily located as shown and these are preferred.</p>
<p>8 November 1979</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study</p>
<p>This week extracts from Part II, Sections 3 &amp; 4: Walls and Fences.</p>
<p>Part of the charm of the town rests with the extensive use of stone walls and simple fencing.</p>
<p>Other than stone the open picket fence, ornamental mesh, galvanised iron and hedges are all common. In more recent times cream brick and coloured concrete blocks have been more prevalent and if this were to continue would help to remove an important component of the Burra townscape. Stone walls should be retained and constructed where possible.</p>
<p>Preferred forms are stone, wood picket and paling (painted white), split timber, decorative screen mesh, iron pickets, galvanised corrugated iron.</p>
<p>A new Swimming Pool Committee was elected on Friday.</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study</p>
<p>This week a closer look at a specific precinct of the town: Precinct 3, Kooringa.</p>
<p>National &amp; State Significance: it was the first company town in Australia.</p>
<p>Local Significance:</p>
<p>It includes the historic commercial centre.</p>
<p>No freehold was granted in the lifetime of the Mine. [Not strictly true; freehold could be bought from 1869 and mining finally ceased in 1877. It was true from 1845-69.]</p>
<p>No local government till 1876.</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>Kooringa was laid out in 1846 as a company town.</p>
<p>It was not anticipated or expected that any other town would be surveyed – certainly no on Section 1.</p>
<p>The Mining Company tried to prevent subdivision outside its section.</p>
<p>Until 1862 no through road directly joined Kooringa with the ‘outside’ town of Redruth-Aberdeen.</p>
<p>Domestic architecture in Kooringa is a mixture of cottages dating from the earliest company cottages to the more substantial residences of the commercial and post-mining period and modern buildings – the latter not always sympathetic.</p>
<p>There is a fine collection of Victorian structures – commercial, Government and public in Market Square, which by 1877, when the Mine closed had become a lively commercial centre and a service centre for the district’s expanding pastoral and agricultural industries.</p>
<p>[Actually it would be hard to find a Government structure in Market Square from the Victorian era. I’m not sure what exactly is encompassed in the term ‘public’, but Market Square’s Victorian buildings are essentially shops, a nice stock agency office (now the Tourist Office), a hotel (whose character is dominated by the upper storey of 1912) and perhaps a fine bank building; if you ignore its address as 1 Market Street. The point being made is certainly valid for Kooringa, but not, I think, if you limit yourself to Market Square.]</p>
<p>29 November 1979</p>
<p>Senior Citizens enjoyed a tour of the Clare Valley last Thursday. 38 participated with the assistance of O’Connor’s Bus service. They travelled to Mintaro, Seven Hill and Clare.</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study</p>
<p>Recommendations for the Kooringa Precinct.</p>
<p>As an historic, commercial and residential centre modern buildings should be ‘in sympathy’.</p>
<p>The quality of its stone structures should be maintained and enhanced.</p>
<p>The ‘gateways’ to Burra precinct should be enhanced, but left uncluttered.</p>
<p>All remaining slate and bluestone kerbing and flagging in the precinct should be retained and a policy of reflagging of kerbing and of footpaths in the main Commercial Centre should be considered.</p>
<p>Unsympathetic buildings, structures and hoardings should be discouraged.</p>
<p>Maintain, enhance and restore historic structures or relics which constitute Burra’s historic heritage e.g. shingle the iron roofing of the jinker shed.</p>

<p>Burra Conservation Study</p>
<p>Part II Section 5. Guidelines for Market Square</p>
<p>The progressive erosion of the historic character of Market Square is often the result of single small acts by individuals. It is important that the establishment of the essential qualities of Market Square is achieved over time by influencing the efforts and actions of the people and shopkeepers actively involved it its day to day functions. Recent developments have not reinforced the continuity of the arcaded space and elevated pedestrian areas.</p>
<p>The recent Post Office to the south [1960] for instance interrupted the live of verandahed shops. This sort of development should be avoided in the future.</p>
<p>The elimination of verandah posts and their replacement by cantilevered or hung awnings should also be resisted. Although such awnings provide shade and shelter, the rhythm, definition of space and the measure of protection from cars provided by posts is lost.</p>
<p>The excuse for the elimination of posts is based on the practice of drivers parking their cars as horses were once left; with their head (or motor) in. Today bumpers tend to overlap gutters and damage posts, which has led to the angled support or the removal of posts. The problem is not with the posts, but with the car.</p>

<p>A number of people expressed concern about the burning off along Burra Creek</p>
<p>Council advises that the Burra &amp; District Advisory Committee requested the area be cleaned up. They suggested fencing and sheep grazing. Council experience was that this was not feasible and decided on burning. The timing was aimed at removing flammable material before the Easter influx of tourists when a number of open fires were lit – some on a fire ban day. Had the area not been burnt the town could have been endangered. Two or three weeks earlier would have been a preferable date, but EFS personnel were not then available. Damage to trees was minimal and the burnt area is now cleared in preparation for the implementation of the Creek Beautification Project.</p>

<p>Burra Community Aid Association held its AGM Wednesday 30 July and elected: Chairman, Rev. David Thiem; Secretary, Mrs Reta Jennison; Treasurer, Rev. Brian Polkinghorne.</p>
<p>The Association was previously known as the Burra [Jubilee] Benevolent Society and has been operating for almost 100 years. One of the things done this year was to obtain large print books for the library for those having difficulty with their vision.</p>
<p>[Burra Record, 9 June 1897, page 3</p>
<p>Burra Jubilee Benevolent Society was formed at a meeting last Thursday with Dr Brummitt as President, Miss Coglin as Secretary and J.F. Moore as Treasurer. The reference to the society being nearly 100 suggests they thought it started with the jubilee of 1887, rather than that of 1897.]</p>

<p>Burra Passenger Train Service</p>
<p>The Burra Burra DC Clerk recently received a letter from Mr Wilson Minister of Transport saying that he had been advised that ANR intends to cease all local passenger services on the routes to the Mid North. This would see the cancellation of 17 trains of the Burra-Peterborough service. It would leave eight services per week on the Peterborough line to connect with the Indian-Pacific. These would be of limited value to the local residents. It is anticipated the services would cease on 1 September 1980.</p>
<p>The rail services could be replaced by a motor coach service operating directly to Adelaide and at times suitable for a one-day return trip. These would operate under licence to the State Government and carry parcels and passengers.</p>
<p>The Council was invited to make a submission.</p>

<p>The Burra Cycling Classic was run last Saturday. The race was first run between Burra and Adelaide in 1907, but since the advent of traffic lights they can no longer finish in the city. This year’s event started at the Burra Town Hall and competitors then rode to Mt Bryan, back to Burra and then to Gawler via Saddleworth, Marrabel, Kapunda and Greenock. 35 started from Burra. In a close finish at Gawler Dave Rootes won by two inches from Ken Watts and Doug Kaesler was a further six inches back. The fastest was Barry Datson off scratch in 4 hours 19 minutes 26 seconds.</p>
<p>This year’s race held unusual local interest. Doug Holly, who had the second fastest time, is Shirley Thamm’s brother. J. Hall, who finished 9th, is a brother to Peter Hall and Ken Watts, who finished 2nd overall, is a former Burra policeman.</p>

<p>Burra National Trust will meet next on 7 April at 8 p.m. in the old Council Meeting Room at the Burra Town Hall (on the right hand side of the foyer). The idea is to look at the room with the aim of setting it up so that visually it appears as the original Council Meeting Room of Burra.</p>
<p>[Actually this was not really the idea. Given that the impressive council furniture dates only from 1936 and replaced furnishings that were described as a disgrace, it seems hardly likely that a period any earlier than 1936 would have been the aim.]</p>
<p>Community Aid Abroad will arrange a local part of The National Walk Against Want in Burra on 12 April. The route is to be Burra to Farrell Flat.</p>
<p>So: get sponsors and walk as far as you can, alone, in a group, with a pet, with a baby in a pusher, but raise what you can.</p>

Apparently over $250,000 is earmarked for the project due to commence later this year.</p>

A brochure outlining the program will be prepared and major companies, particularly mining companies across Australia will be canvassed. As 1981 is the centenary of the birth of Essington Lewis, former head of BHP, it was thought appropriate to approach companies like BHP to assist in the preservation of Burra’s mining heritage.</p>

<p>The Gaslight Restaurant</p>
<p>Bob and Jan Wright from Alice Springs were forced to extend their stay in Burra last January due to heavy rains in Central Australia. As a result they saw the potential for the Market Square Café to be developed into a restaurant. Since buying the place Bob has researched the building’s history. He found that the building began its career in 1858 as the Gaslight Café and since then has experienced a chequered career with many changes of ownership. To coincide with the opening of the rotunda in 1910 its name was changed to the Market Square Café. In 1922 the Prime Minister Billy Hughes dined at the café before officially opening the Soldiers’ Memorial in Market Square. Today under the name of ‘The Gaslight Restaurant’ it continues its century and a quarter career in the food retailing industry. Today the atmosphere of the past is created by the use of the Victorian era furnishings and background music from a beautiful nickelodeon. Meals are typical of the turn of the century.</p>
<p>[Mr Wright may have researched the café’s history, but we have been unable to find any corroborating references for the use of the name ‘Gaslight’.</p>
<p>The rotunda was opened in 1911.</p>
<p>If The Prime Minister dined there in 1922 there is no mention of it in newspaper reports of the time – or at least a Trove search failed to discover one.</p>
<p>In January 1923 Mr A.L. Bence had bought the store from Miss Snell and it became then a draper’s shop.</p>
<p>It certainly did not have a century and a quarter career in food retailing.</p>
<p>Miss Snell’s father had owned the building for many years. He had a business there as a jeweller, later ran a Temperance Hotel in the building and later still operated a labour exchange from it and was described early in the 1900s as a stationer.</p>
<p>It would be nice to confirm the Gaslight story, even if the building’s continuity as a café is clearly an exaggeration.]</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC is concerned at the amount of recreational land scattered about the town. One such area is the tennis courts between Smelts Road and the Crescent. A proposal has been brought forward to subdivide the area south of the toilet block into eight building blocks and to sell them for residential development and devote the proceeds to the provision of new tennis courts at the War Memorial Oval. The section of parklands with trees will remain [i.e. the old Burra North Playground.] The plan would require that buyers erect houses within four years and that the blocks could not be sold prior to the erection of a house, without the prior consent of Council.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC Elections: Candidate Profiles</p>
<p>Muriel Elizabeth Mary Bence</p>
<p>Born in London ‘in the olden days’. Educated at St Jude’s Church of England Southwark and West Square Secondary. In 1939 was evacuated to the country, but returned in time for the first air raid. Lived and worked in London through WWII at Oldham’s Press Woman Magazine, then as Post Office counter clerk at Lambeth Walk PO, Balham Hill PO and Streatham PO. Later in the office of two Government Departments and that of the South African High Commissioner. In January 1945 met FO Leonard Bence at a reception at South Africa House and married him at St Margaret’s the Queen in June 1945. Arrived in SA in March 1946 and came to Burra in August 1947 with a 10-day-old son. Two other sons were born in Burra (one deceased).</p>
<p>Instigator and Secretary of the Burra Branch of the Arts Council of SA.</p>
<p>Inaugural member and President of M &amp; BHA.</p>
<p>Inaugural member of Burra Meals on Wheels.</p>
<p>Inaugural member of Burra Committee of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>Inaugural member Group 23 Burra branch of the Penguin Club of Australia – President, Secretary and Convention Speaker.</p>
<p>Member of Burra Red Cross with 25 year service medal.</p>
<p>Member Burra Cup Committee – Past president and Secretary.</p>
<p>Member Burra Hospital Auxiliary.</p>
<p>Member Burra &amp; District Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>In favour of progress, but not just for the sake of change and not if it interferes with the interests and quality of life of the Burra people.</p>
<p>Having travelled widely I consider SA and Burra specifically a highly desirable place to live.</p>
<p>Fully prepared to devote time and energy to the Council to maintain Burra as that desirable place.</p>
<p>R.J. (Dick) Cuttle</p>
<p>In 71⁄2 years in Burra I have been involved in many aspects of the town and district and believe I have made a true contribution to the district and its people through these organisations. I have gained considerable administrative experience and have had dealings with the Burra Burra DC. Those experiences include:</p>
<p>Sport as a player, umpire, administrator and coach.</p>
<p>School Council as an elected parent representative.</p>
<p>Apex Club – many functions from Service Director to debater to President.</p>
<p>Kindergarten Committee.</p>
<p>Burra District Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Burra Copper Festival 1977 Publicity Officer.</p>
<p>Having lived in three different country areas, have experience of four local governments.</p>
<p>Have an interest in contributing to and learning more of its functions.</p>
<p>My election would ensure at least one representative was from neither a farming nor a business background and if elected would try to have meetings changed to evenings to make Council more accessible to people in the area.</p>
<p>Frank Ford</p>
<p>The opportunity to choose from four candidates is rarely offered. I would if re-elected do my best to serve the interests of the people of Burra. As a Councillor I have been its representative on the Tourist Committee and as Chairperson have seen it go ahead in such a way that we can be proud and have one of the most successful tourist offices in SA. With the help of volunteers it is self supporting and costs the ratepayer nothing. The town and district has an outstanding history and we should do all in our power to take advantage of this as it could well be the answer to the survival of the commercial core of the town. I feel that there is an ongoing job to be done and if re-elected would certainly try to do it. I hope I have always been ready to see beyond the town to the needs of the district as a whole.</p>
<p>Des. Woolley</p>
<p>Time limitations set by my employer prevented me from taking the step of seeking election some years ago. I have always had an interest in Council matters and taken a strong line on local affairs. I became interested and active in local affairs via the District Advisory Panel and Tourist Office Committee. I hope to justify my existence on Council as there are several areas within the control of Council that, to me, are unapproachable except from within the Council. Some principal concerns are:</p>
<p>Escalating rates</p>
<p>Revenue wasted on short term patch-up repairs</p>
<p>Increased staffing, machinery and costs that need to be matched by increased output and expertise.</p>
<p>A great deal has been achieved by the previous Council; I look forward to being part of the new Council.</p>

<p>Burra Manual Telephone Exchange Closes</p>
<p>At 10.45 a.m. on 30 September 1981 Mrs E. Shattock of Commercial Street ended her phone call to Mrs T. Rawlins of Queen Street and the era of the manually operated telephone exchange in Burra came to an end. The normal number of telephonists on duty varied from three to five, but for the occasion all fourteen telephonists on staff were present. At 10.55 a.m. the sign of disconnection took place as small metal shutters began to fall open all over the board to reveal the numbers of Burra’s 500 subscribers as Telecom technicians removed the connections. Alarm bells rang and buzzers sounded, but instead of prompting the concern of telephonists this time they were greeted by cheers and mixed emotions. Chocolates were handed round and a cake in the shape of the old switchboard was cut. A formal end to the era was celebrated at a function in the Town Hall that evening when each lady was presented with a plaque made from timbers of the old switchboard. There was a delay of a few hours before the automatic system cut in. A few people are still experiencing a problem because they are not waiting for a dial tone before beginning to dial. The delay can be two or three seconds.</p>

<p>Burra Yacht Club Regatta</p>
<p>The Yacht Club owes its origins to an incident a bit over a year ago when ‘Tracker’ James became stranded in his car while attempting to cross a tributary of the Burra Creek. He was rescued by the combined efforts of the customers from the nearby Bon Accord Hotel. One of the rescuers made a joke about a yacht club and from this random remark sprang the Burra Yacht Club. Last Sunday under perfect conditions a crowd of over 1,000 attended the club’s second regatta. Three races were held in a carnival atmosphere.</p>

<p>The 104th Burra Show [As usual this is incorrect. It was the 89th Burra Show.]</p>
<p>A fine day drew a good crowd to make the show a great success. The horses in action were a highlight. There was a good bird section and excellent participation in Needlework. Merino sheep and the wool sections were also of great interest. President Peter Stockman welcomed all. Shearing was re-introduced this year and proved a crowd-pleaser. Sporting personality Darryl Hicks was a guest of honour and officially opened the show.</p>

<p>Catholic Parish of Burra-Spalding Family Day 1981 will be at Hallett Institute on Sunday 25 October.</p>
<p>Burra War Memorial Oval Management Committee is delighted to have received a grant of $40,000 from the SA Government. Plans are being finalised with a view to a start by the new year.</p>
<p>Ray Jennison reflects on 13 years as a Councillor</p>
<p>In that time Local Government has undergone many changes. Most significant were the granting of adult franchise and the recognition by State and Federal Parliaments of Local Government as the third tier of government in Australia. Local Government now receives 2% of total Australian personal income tax revenue as an untied grant each year. The Federal Grants Commission assesses each Council on a needs basis and for 1981-82 the Burra Burra DC will receive $118,000. These two factors brought more responsibilities, such as planning, community development, health and welfare, libraries, environment, tourism, fires and emergency services and the arts to add to the traditional Council worries over rates, roads and rubbish. I believe the changes have been for the better in that they have given local communities more say in fashioning their life styles.</p>
<p>The opportunity to really lift our district came in 1969 with the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils. The new Council could rationalise staff and speak with a more powerful voice to State and federal Governments. The foresight of the Town Council in acquiring the old Burra Mine site paid a bonus in 1970 when SAMIN re-opened the copper mine and we were able to receive royalties. This enabled the Council to build the new Civic Centre and purchase the Tourist Office site – both of which are proving their worth to the district. The building of the Community School has strengthened community feeling and brought a new depth to our lifestyle. Along with it came the closing of the Institute Library and the establishment of the Community Library. Another important event was the Burra Conservation Study and its recommendations have been adopted by our Planning Committee as the basis for development and conservation of this historic, heritage rich district. These changes made Council aware of the need for greater input from the community, resulting in the formation of the Burra District Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Many impressive projects have been started or completed in the last 13 years:</p>
<p>Sealing of the Burra-Spalding Road</p>
<p>The Burra Oval watering scheme</p>
<p>The common effluent drainage scheme</p>
<p>The Tourist Office</p>
<p>The Pest Plant Control Scheme</p>
<p>Building the Civic Centre and the District Clerk’s residence</p>
<p>Raising the district contribution enabling us to have a full size sports stadium [i.e. at BCS]</p>
<p>The Community Library</p>
<p>Sealing streets in Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat</p>
<p>Purchase of land for an 18 hole golf course</p>
<p>Building six new tennis courts</p>
<p>And about to commence is a new Sports Complex at the Burra Oval.</p>
<p>I consider it a privilege to have been able to work in this fulfilling role and wish the new Councillors well.</p>

<p>BCS Copper Toxicity</p>
<p>Following the deaths of several BCS animals samples were sent to the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science in Adelaide for analysis. The normal copper level in the liver of a sheep is 0.5 to 9.4 units. A merino ewe that died of pregnancy toxaemia had a reading of 15.1. A merino hogget had one of 47.16.</p>
<p>The Romney Marsh ewe that died at the end of last term had a reading of 22.68. Another recent case also returned a verdict of copper toxicity and a liver reading of 18.</p>
<p>Enquiries have been made to determine where all this copper is coming from. The smelting works was in an adjacent paddock and much slag is scattered all over the locality and samples are often found in the Gully and Faraway Paddocks. Also many paths in the area are made with mine tailings, which also contain small amounts of copper. Testing is continuing and until these results are in we will not know which paddocks are a problem and which, if any, are safe. Hopefully we will be able to devise some remedial strategy.</p>
<p>Edith M. Carpenter, President of the Burra Branch of the Arts Council of SA reports on the past year.</p>
<p>The Arts Access Scheme now allows branch committees to arrange their own shows to augment the program provided by the central Committee.</p>
<p>In July we organised our first Arts Access presentation – singer Lorna Orr and pianists Cathy Steer and Jack Coombs. Arts Access also allowed for Graham McCarthy to attend the AGM. Central Services provided Sleuth in March and the ‘Mucky Duck’ Band in September.</p>
<p>School programs for the year were:</p>
<p>Peasants All</p>
<p>Mucky Duck Bush Band</p>

<p>BCS Year 11 students went on a bush walk on Sunday to climb Mt Bryan Razorback Ridge. What was planned as a full day’s hike was accomplished by midday and an early camp was made, giving time to explore around the old Reed homestead. The weather then turned nasty and it was decided to re-site the tents in the shelter of the shearers’ quarters, which provided a windbreak. Use was made of the shearers’ kitchen. Morning revealed a rather sodden group with some collapsed tents and soggy sleeping bags. The final day saw a hike to Burra across the ranges to the Redruth Gaol.</p>

A management group will meet soon to plan for 1982 and to release a financial statement to indicate the level of support needed for 1982. The future of the Community news depends on money to cover costs, but also on the goodwill and labour of many ladies in the community for typing, proof reading, art work, etc. All are volunteers.</p>

<p>BCS Copper Toxicity</p>
<p>Since the last report two hoggets and a ewe (all merinos) have died from copper toxicity and it is suspected in another death. Normal copper levels in soil vary from 0.2 to1.5 parts per million. The Hocky Paddock reading was 88 ppm and in small paddocks on the flat up to 292 ppm. The readings from pasture plants were also high:</p>
<p>From 17 to 58 ppm and also high in iron (90 to 705 ppm) though excess iron does not cause the problems associated with copper.</p>
<p>A possible solution is to apply superphosphate containing molybdenum. This element when present in small amounts can lock up the copper so it is not then present in plants eaten by sheep. This will be followed up next year.</p>
<p>Local artist Bob Wright has a one man exhibition at 33 Hastings Street Glenelg, which was opened on Saturday by Sir Keith Seaman as one of his last official duties before retiring. [As Governor? Recheck because my reference says Sir Keith Seaman was Governor from 1977 till March 1982.]</p>

<p>He was notable for his diplomacy, foresight and concern for others.</p>
<p>He came to an old school that was a clutter of prefabs behind the old building, with a division into Primary and High Schools, with low student and staff morale and with poor facilities and a poor image.</p>
<p>He oversaw its transformation to a Community School offering education from Kindergarten to Year 12 and beyond with facilities second to none.</p>
<p>A great deal of the success of this transition is due to his tireless effort and meticulous care to keep track of changes, new ideas and problems as they arose.</p>
<p>He played an important role in the Burra District Advisory Committee and aided the establishment of the Senior Citizens Club.</p>
<p>He took an interest in heritage matters.</p>
<p>He was also largely responsible for setting up ‘Community News’.</p>
<p>In all this he has been strongly supported by his wife Denise in church and sporting bodies and on committees as well as personally.</p>
<p>Citizen of the Year Award</p>
<p>The Burra Citizen of the Year is Chris McCabe, former BCS Principal.</p>

<p>Ian Auhl wrote seeking information about Elizabeth A. Ward who lived in Burra in the 1930s and was probably elderly then.</p>
<p>[Ian Auhl was preparing Burra-Burra Reminiscences of the Burra Mine and Its Townships and despite widespread enquiry he had been unable to identify Elizabeth Ward who had written reminiscences of Burra that appeared in the Burra Record in 1936 under the heading Memories of Burra.</p>
<p>An Elizabeth Ann Ward died 5 June 1952 aged 92. She would thus have been born about 1860. There is no certainty of her birth, but an Elizabeth Ann Ward was born 10 October 1861 at Clare to Richard and Elizabeth nee White and an R. Ward was living in Burra in 1876. The evidence in the articles she wrote places her in school in Burra 1870-1874. It seems likely that this is the person writing in 1936.</p>
<p>An obituary in the Burra Record 17 June 1952, page 4 adds the information:</p>
<p>Elizabeth Ann Ward was buried in Burra on 6 June. Miss Ward had been an active member of the Salvation Army in Burra for 61 years and a long-time Sunday school teacher there. For the last six years she lived in a private nursing home in Adelaide.]</p>

<p>Adelaide &amp; Wallaroo Fertilisers are doing a good job at re-moulding the landscape of the dumping areas and dams. As they are covered to capacity with black residue from copper oxide operations they are smoothed over to follow the contour of gently undulating hills. Once moulded the area is seeded with rye grass and clover and within six months looks like a naturally grassed hillside. They are also planting suitable trees on the slopes. The white stream that issues from the tall chimney is pure and free from contamination.</p>

<p>Ian Auhl writes of having discovered details of the life and headstone of Captain Henry Roach of the Burra Mine.</p>
<p>His house was in Gover Street North Adelaide where he lived in retirement until his death in 1889.</p>
<p>The headstone is in Payneham Cemetery. [Photo.]</p>
<p>He was Chief Captain of the Burra Mine 1847-67.</p>
<p>In this period he was second only to Henry Ayers in directing the activities of the mine.</p>
<p>He was born in Redruth, Cornwall, in 1808, in the heart of the tin and copper mining area.</p>
<p>His obituary in the Observer of October 1889 says:</p>
<p>‘Captain Henry Roach who died on Sunday at the ripe old age of 81, formerly engaged in Cornwall mines where he gained experience which stood him in good stead in his colonial career. Previous to coming to South Australia, he went to Bolwar in Colombia in South America. In 1846 he settled in South Australia and received his appointment in 1847 to the Burra Burra Mine. After twenty years of faithful service he retired and has been living ever since on his property in Gover Street, North Adelaide. He was a man justly respected for his uprightness and sterling character. His funeral service at Payneham was attended by a considerable number of citizens including Sir Henry Ayers.’</p>
<p>BCS. In Community Week BCS students planted trees at the Miners’ Dugouts to screen adjacent properties, restored and painted the picket fence at the Market Square Museum and washed the Diamond T Fire Engine at the Bon Accord Museum.

<p>Channel 7 Television sent a team to Burra last Sunday to film a segment for State Affair.</p>
<p>The main purpose of their visit was to investigate the effect of off road vehicles on the Buddle Pits in the Burra Mine area as reported in the press last week and to cover historic and tourist aspects of the town. Scenes were shot in Market Square, Paxton Square and the Brewery Cellars.</p>

<p>Ian Auhl’s Article on Captain Roach, Part 2</p>
<p>At Burra Captain Roach and fellow captains and office staff lived in a row of cottages overlooking the Mine.</p>
<p>Early in 1867 Roach received a confidential letter from Ayers, by then Sir Henry Ayers and Premier of SA, asking him to inform his brother officers of the suspension of all operations on the mine and than mining would become an open cut operation.</p>
<p>A month later he received a letter informing all officers that their services were no longer required.</p>
<p>At age 59 Roach found himself retired without a pension.</p>
<p>His salary had been since 1854 $900 p.a.</p>
<p>With his savings he bought an allotment in Gover Street, North Adelaide and had three cottages erected. He was a bachelor and resided in the middle cottage – living on the income from the other two until his death in October 1889.</p>
<p>His funeral service was in the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Wellington Square (now owned by Channel 9).</p>
<p>His cottage is now owned and occupied by Mr &amp; Mrs Murray Docherty and named Uraparinga after their former home at Williamstown.</p>
<p>Captain Roach’s headstone is well preserved, but is leaning precariously and is bare of any surrounds.</p>
<p>I would suggest it be made safe and given a modest surround and I am willing to arrange for this to be done.</p>

<p>Burra National Trust has made a submission for funds under the National Estate Grants Program to restore the Bon Accord Mine Buildings.</p>
<p>These comprise the Engineer’s Workshop and Mine Manager’s Residence and were built in 1846. They are on the Register of the National Estate, listed on the Register of State heritage Items and classified by the National Trust of SA. The local branch of the National Trust has started to set the site up as a Copper Mining Museum. The local branch will match any funds granted on a dollar for dollar basis.</p>
<p>The restoration costs are estimated at $17,000, so the local branch will need to raise over $8,500. They intend to do so by hiring keys to visitors of other National Trust sites in Burra, conducting bus tours of Burra, charging an entrance fee to the Bon Accord Mine Museum on long weekends and school holidays and bus tours to sites outside Burra in the district. The aim is to have the Bon Accord Mine Museum open every day with a caretaker living in the Mine Manager’s house. It is hoped to have the project finished for the Burra Copper festival over the October long weekend in 1983.</p>

<p>Burra has a community enriched by history and community spirit and I see the possibility of serving on Council as an opportunity to make my contribution for the towns’ residents.</p>
<p>In particular I feel women in the Burra area do need to be represented at Local Government level.</p>
<p>I have a strong belief that Councils represent people and if elected will visit as many homes as possible to find out the views and ideas of residents.</p>
<p>Derek Rayfield (ex-serviceman &amp; businessman)</p>
<p>Have lived in Burra for several years.</p>
<p>Would like to work for the improvement of roads and footpaths around Burra.</p>

<p>Helen R. Stockman</p>
<p>I am the wife of Peter Stockman; we have three sons all attending BCS. I have a longstanding interest in local government and have attended many Council meetings as an observer, finding them extremely interesting. Common sense and sound decision making are the important aspects of Council work.</p>
<p>I would promote the interests of Burra in terms of street sealing and community development, tourism etc. as well as taking an interest in the overall financial management of Council.</p>

<p>Burra Show Society. President’s Report</p>
<p>The annual show on 9 October was a success considering the poor seasonal conditions. Gate takings were up c. $200. There were record entries in Floral Art, Pets, Junior Needlework and Sheep and average entries elsewhere. In the year the main hall was repaired and gutters and windows were repaired and painted. Horse stalls were remodelled and rebuilt with piping stalls, thanks to the Pony Club. Painting was also done on the front of the Secretary’s Office, Flower Pavilion and along the Pets’ Section and Canteen area. Further painting and repair is needed to ceilings and roofs of the three main pavilions as well as to the poultry shed.</p>
<p>There is a healthy bank balance of $7,718, so some of this work can be done in 1983.</p>
<p>It is with regret that we note the recent death of Mr Fred Atkin, who was our valued handyman around the showground.</p>
<p>The assistance of the Rural Youth Club, Pony Club, Pistol Club and Scouts and Cubs throughout the year and on show day is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Office Bearers for 1982-83: Patron, Mr Murray Stockman; President, Mr D. Kellock; Vice-Presidents, Mr J. Duncan &amp; Mr R. Shipard; Secretary, Mrs J. Jamieson.</p>

<p>Jubilee 150 Burra Mine Scale Model</p>
<p>Report by Pam Marlow on the progress of her model:</p>
<p>A contour map of the area has been compiled using available maps of c. 1852, c. 1870 and 1920.</p>
<p>All structures to be modelled have been identified from the 1858 Bentley painting.</p>
<p>The framework for about one fifth of the area has been constructed and preliminary work on the landscape of this area has been started.</p>
<p>Research and trial an error mode has been employed on getting the masonry to look right.</p>
<p>Polyfilla plaster over balsa wood was the basis; the stonework was then scribed into the plaster and then painted.</p>
<p>The paint was made from finely powdered local rock and glue.</p>
<p>Even though the family is moving, I will continue the work, bringing the modules back to Burra as they are completed.</p>
<p>I would like to thank all who have helped; the Burra Burra DC for encouragement and support and the BCS students too.</p>

<p>Flood</p>
<p>Tropical Cyclones Ken and Elinor off the northwest and northeast coasts of Australia respectively fed tropical moist air into SA. On Wednesday afternoon and evening 38 mm of rain fell. At about 7.15 p.m. the tributary creek that flows through Kooringa burst its banks and sent torrents of water along Commercial Street. Some flooding occurred in businesses along Commercial Street, but hardest hit were the heritage cottages in Thames Street, some of which had 30 cm of water flowing through them at the peak.</p>
<p>[Photo of Market Square with sandbags at Sue’s Shoes and another of Vin Dower inspecting damage in his Thames Street home.]</p>
<p>On Thursday at 3 p.m. a second storm deposited 24 mm of rain and hail in 45 minutes. Flooding was extensive. The creek [from the Gaol] threatened houses in Tregony Street and at one stage there were 25 SES volunteers battling to save houses there. Two of them were swept away in the watercourse, but escaped with minor cuts and bruises.</p>
<p>[Later in a report of this incident it becomes confusing. It says Greg Woolley and Craig McBride were swept away into Burra Creek, having previously reported this effort to be along the creek by Tregony Street. It goes on to say they were saved by the bridge. It reports that a week later Greg still had the imprint of the bridge pylon on his stomach. Both men spent a short time in hospital.]</p>
<p>The school children were kept back for 50 minutes until water levels subsided.</p>
<p>There was water damage to the recently sealed road to the Redruth Gaol and to the bike path.</p>
<p>A third storm struck at 5.30 p.m. on Friday, but this time flooding was minor. On Saturday eight SES volunteers from Burra went to the Barossa Valley to assist in the clean-up operations in the badly affected areas there.</p>

<p>Paxton Square Opening</p>
<p>After opening Paxton Square the Premier and his wife ‘dropped in’ at 7 Kingston Street where the cottage had recently been restored to its mid-Victorian charm by Mr Colin Fidock, Miss Kath Millard and her Year 11 History class. They then went on to the formal lunch at the Civic Centre. [Photo.]</p>
<p>Last Friday was the culmination of a great deal of hard work for all persons involved in the restoration of Paxton Square. Speeches were delivered by:</p>
<p>Mr James Hawker, Chairman of the Burra Burra District Council</p>
<p>Mr Andrew Gebhardt, Chairman of the Lewis Board of Management</p>
<p>Mr Gordon Davidson, Chairman of the SA Heritage Commission</p>
<p>Mr Bob Lewis, representing the Lewis Family</p>
<p>Mr John Bannon, Premier of South Australia, who declared the cottages open. The points were made that:</p>
<p>The project was a good example of joint action by Federal, State and Local Governments.</p>
<p>The accommodation was unusual if not unique as tourist accommodation in Australia.</p>
<p>The cottages had been threatened with demolition on a number of occasions and had been saved by the intervention of the Lewis Family and Mr Ian Auhl.</p>

<p>Obituary. Sid Scroop, who died recently was made a Life Member of the Aberdeen Tennis Club some 30 years ago and to members was regarded as almost as permanent as the courts and buildings that he had helped to erect. Few are prepared to devote as much time and energy to both playing tennis and working for the Association as Sid did over many years. At 62 years of age he was a member of an A Grade premiership team. For over 30 years he was particularly involved with the preparation and running of the Easter Tournaments. He only recently retired as caretaker and was mainly a spectator for just the past two years. His wife Flo and daughter Aileen are also Life Members of the club.</p>

<p>4 August 1983</p>
<p>Burra District Advisory Committee has expressed its concern over the intention of the Burra Burra DC to lease Redbanks Reserve for grazing and to allow the continued use of the area for off-road vehicles. Off-road vehicles have partly destroyed a large section of the scrubland and will continue to do so until it is all destroyed. Stock grazing would place a further strain on the area – especially in the open areas.</p>
<p>Concern was expressed that grazing would destroy one of the few remaining scrub areas in the district. The feed left is needed to preserve the area as a nature reserve and any further grazing would turn it into just another pastoral area – it would stop the re-establishment of scrub and saltbush. It was suggested that if any area had to be grazed it should be the area west of Baldina Creek and the eastern areas (flats and scrub) should be left as a nature reserve.</p>
<p>The committee felt that off-road vehicles should be removed.</p>
<p>They suggested off-road vehicle users were violating Native Clearance Control Regulations by removing mallee for fires and that the Council was liable for this as the leaseholder. It recommended that the RAA be requested to delete Redbanks Reserve as a recognised off-road vehicle area. (They felt that a partial removal of off-road vehicles would be ineffective.) It was recommended that application be made under the Native Vegetation Retention Scheme for the fencing of the reserve to keep out off-road vehicles.</p>
<p>Burra Entertainment Group AGM will be held at BCS staff room at 8 p.m. 24 August. If interest remains at last year’s level, this meeting will wind up the group and dispose of its assets.</p>

<p>James Hawker, Chairman of the Burra Burra DC presents a discussion paper on unemployment.</p>
<p>[Printed here and in the following issue. The paper considered the reason for considerable unemployment in the Burra District stemmed from the closure of the mine as well as from the movement of unemployed people into the area.]</p>
<p>Some of the social implications were:</p>
<p>A pensioner is on a different social level from a recently unemployed person.</p>
<p>Unemployed people are extremely sensitive about their status within the community and apt to react to thoughtless generalisations.</p>
<p>There is resistance in the community to many of the programs that have the potential to improve and/or increase the say of the unemployed in community affairs.</p>
<p>This resistance states the premise that if you provide a suitable environment for unemployed people, including low income housing, you will attract more unemployed people, which we don’t want anyway.</p>
<p>Some of Burra’s unemployed are coping remarkably well, while others cannot successfully come to grips with the change in their lifestyle. Some have high level skills.</p>
<p>What can Local Government do?</p>
<p>Take no action – deciding it is a matter for State and Federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Take action – play a supportive role by using avenues provided by Community Development Boards, sporting and service clubs etc.</p>
<p>[The article then goes on to discuss some ways in which this can be done and how ingrained attitudes of the community and of the unemployed may be changed.]</p>
<p>Burra Town Hall Committee has been granted $12,000 from Burra Burra DC for maintenance and is currently searching for grant money to supplement this. The AGM is to be held on 17 October.</p>

The locomotive will then be turned on the turntable for the return trip to Adelaide. The restoration was done with the permission of ANR and the Department of Tourism provided a subsidy of $1,000. Timber had to be purchased from WA as the size required was not available in SA.</p>

He was superintendent of the Burra Burra Copper Mine and Teddy’s father, Edwin Gilbert Howell, was born in Burra in 1860. Mr Howell and his brother intend to visit Burra for the Copper Festival. Some senior citizens may remember Teddy Howell co-starring at the Theatre Royal with Jessie Mathews in a play called Janus or in Oliver at Her Majesty’s. He also played ‘Fred’ and ‘Mr Sproggins’ in the radio serial Fred &amp; Maggie &amp; Everybody, which ran on radio station 5DN for many years. More recently he has appeared on TV in episodes of A Country Practice as ‘Bert Griffiths’ and as the old man ‘Ginger’ with his dog ‘Carpenter’.</p>

<p>J. Denton’s General Store at Farrell Flat closed its doors for the last time on 29 July 1983. The store dated from the town’s earliest days. In the late 1800s it was Reilly’s Store and then Sexton’s. Mr J.O. Denton acquired it in 1907. He also had a wheat store, now the Ford dealership. Myra Przibilla (nee Denton) was the last shopkeeper. She was born in the house attached to the store and has lived there since 1912. There were seven children and all spent some of their early life at the shop. It was a general store selling everything from paint to chaff and hardware and groceries. For a time before 1915 the Post Office was also located there. In 1957 service was reduced to three days a week until the store closed. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Redbanks Reserve</p>
<p>Council is considering proposals for the Reserve and will soon announce its plans. Years ago Redbanks was a well-known overnight stop for resting and watering travelling stock. More recently it has become a recreation area. Some months ago the Council received submissions from surrounding landowners concerning off-road vehicles leaving the reserve and entering private land. The Department of Lands then reduced the area of the reserve by allowing landowners adjoining it to fence down to three chains on the Baldina Creek portion and on the northern side of Redbanks Reserve, as requested by the landholders.</p>
<p>The Department then offered the Reserve to the Burra Burra DC with a suggestion the Council should consider maintaining the off-road vehicle section as this facility had been available for many years and allowing the Council to make its own decision on the sub-leasing.</p>
<p>From the recommendations of the Redbanks Reserve Committee Council accepted a proposal to fence the Reserve, providing an area for off-road vehicles, an area for recreation and one for controlled grazing. There would need to be an easement for water from Baldina Creek for the Radford Family’s irrigation block on the north side of the Reserve.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Council, Mr Janes Hawker, said the Council was aware of the value of tourism to the town and it had been ascertained that off-road users do contribute to the viability of certain traders. Council was also aware of the previous unruly element sometimes seen at Redbanks. Council believed that the offer recently made by the motor cycle clubs will bring about self-regulated control by the clubs under Council supervision.</p>
<p>Council is considering sub-leasing of the area set aside for recreation and controlled grazing to the Oval Management Committee who would fence the area and receive the benefit of the grazing.</p>
<p>At the October Council meeting a deputation presented a petition to Council, asking that off-road vehicles be banned from Redbanks. No decision will be made until Council receives an environmental impact study, which it requested recently.</p>

<p>Citizen of the Year Award: Colin Fidock</p>
<p>Colin Fidock was presented with the award for 1984 at a ceremony on Australia Day at Burra Bowling Club.</p>
<p>Colin (39) has made an outstanding contribution to the district in the six years he has been here. He has been the Community Librarian and displayed fastidious attention to any detail of its operation. His input into this successful library has resulted in his being a key figure as the Community Libraries representative on the Education Department’s Library Advisory Committee. Colin is also an active member of the Burra Branch of the Arts Council where he has played an important part in voicing the concern on the Arts on relevant issues. His religious endeavours are a model to all Christians. Colin has been a member of St Mary’s Church Burra Advisory Council. He is one of the Church’s Lay Readers and is licensed by the Bishop to administer the sacrament.</p>
<p>For four years he has been the curator of the National Trust properties and in that time their upgrading has been a major aim. The Market Square Museum under his guidance has been transformed from an ad hoc collection of artefacts to an excellent recreation of a general store-post office and attached residence of the turn of the century. The Paxton Square cottage he created for the opening of the cottages was a real indication of his talents and desire to serve the community. Colin is also a dedicated family man and his skill in promoting the family image upon which our society relies so much is to be admired. Burr Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker presented Colin with the inscribed medallion.</p>

The meeting passed a motion reaffirming the branch’s willingness to hand over the property subject to six specific conditions; one of which is approval from National Trust SA, which has still to be given.

<p>The Jubilee 150 Board has advised the Council that it approved in principle proposals in a report by the Heritage Conservation Branch in respect to the Burra Heritage Town Project.</p>
<p>The Branch compiled the report following several meetings held by the working party appointed to consider proposals on the application by the Burra Burra DC for financial assistance under the Jubilee 150 Board Programs.</p>
<p>The Premier had announced some months previously that $470,000 would be provided by the Commonwealth Government in response to the Council’s application. The report proposed the funds be expended as follows:</p>
<p>Restoration and adaptation of Paxton Square Cottages – Kingston St Row 150,000</p>
<p>Repairs to the existing Bon Accord Mine Buildings 30,000</p>
<p>Further restoration of Morphett’s Pump House 25,000</p>
<p>Establishment of a Copper Museum/Interpretive Centre incorporating</p>
<p>the Bon Accord Mine Site</p>
<p>Construction of a new building 180,000</p>
<p>Fitting out of displays in the new and existing buildings 50,000</p>
<p>Appointment of a Heritage Officer 35,000</p>
<p>$470,000</p>
<p>Restoration and adaptation of the Paxton Square Cottages has been implemented, with the prior approval of the J150 Board and the funds allocated as designated. Funds were also allocated to the proposal by Council and through the Government’s Wage Pause-Job Creation Scheme.</p>
<p>The J150 Board in its letter to the Chairman of the District Council indicated that repairs to the Bon Accord Mine Buildings, repairs and restoration of Morphett’s Pump House and the appointment of the Heritage Officer should all proceed as soon as possible – in liaison with the Heritage Conservation Branch and the History Trust.</p>
<p>The Board has imposed a condition on the establishment of the Copper Interpretive Centre that the whole of the Bon Accord Site must be transferred to the Burra Burra DC.</p>
<p>It is currently owned by the National Trust and negotiations for its transfer are proceeding with the Trust’s State Executive. The Burra Branch of the National Trust has advised Council that it supports this transfer in the best interests of the heritage of Burra and the preservation of the site.</p>
<p>Council will call a public meeting at the Civic Centre on Tuesday 24 July at 8 p.m. to advise the public of all matters concerned with the project, the reasons for the minor variations to the Council’s original application and the delay in reaching the approval in principle stage. It will seek the support of the community to ensure the entire project is completed in the SA Jubilee year 1986.</p>

<p>Land Sale</p>
<p>Recently the Burra Burra DC became aware that the land belonging to the late Mr Ted Kotz was for sale. Over recent years the National Trust and the Department of Environment and Planning (Heritage Conservation Branch) have advised the Council that it should acquire this particular part of the creek area because of its heritage significance i.e. the archaeological sites of dugouts.</p>
<p>The land is offered in three lots:</p>
<p>The creek area</p>
<p>Vacant land</p>
<p>Kotz’s house and outbuildings.</p>
<p>Public Parks Advisory Committee was approached and advised it would be willing to subsidise purchase of the creek area as a park and the Department of Environment and Planning has verbally indicated a willingness to contribute to the cost of that area.</p>
<p>Subsequently the Council purchased all three lots.</p>
<p>It now has to decide what to do with lots 2 &amp; 3 – whether to keep them for the people of Burra or to develop them as the people direct. The Burra District Advisory Committee and other bodies have been approached and the National Trust has appraised the house and outbuildings, which have been made secure.</p>

<p>Obituary. Hilda Shipard died at Burra Hospital on 19 October and was buried at Pt Lincoln. She was aged almost 90. She was born Hilda Milman and grew up in the English Lakes District, but after WWI she immigrated to Australia with various family members. They went first to Sydney, but eventually settled on Eyre Peninsula. In 1926 she met and married William Shipard, a farmer and a widower with a young daughter. They settled at Yantanabie and set about building up a farm from the mallee scrub. In 1942 they moved to North Shields before moving to Poonindie Hill. They were well known in the area and Hilda was known as a fine cook and was active in district affairs. She also enjoyed gardening, running poultry, sewing and handicraft. In a 1952 bushfire she saved a herd of cows by driving them into a dam. They came to Burra in 1969 and until her admission to hospital Mrs Shipard lived on the property near her son and daughter-in-law, Ron and Pam. Her eldest child Clifford died in 1954.</p>

<p>Burra Apex Club</p>
<p>The club will cease to exist from 30 June after many years of successful service. After growing from a small beginning, it grew to become one of the larger country clubs, but has now reverted to a small under-active club in which many members are getting towards the age limit for Apex. It is not living up to its charted and unless there is an immediate influx of members in the 18-40 years age group, the club will close at the end of June. Steve Woolley, President.</p>
<p>The Jubilee Trade Train is coming to Burra. It is a major Jubilee 150 event. It is a travelling showcase of our industrial expertise, innovations and achievements. It is a series of exciting displays and demonstrations housed in a series of special exhibitions. The railway station platform and surrounding area will form part of the display. Local district and regional industries and promotions will be displayed and it is hoped local service groups will arrange stalls, entertainment, refreshments, etc. It is hoped they will organise events to coincide with the exhibition, such as a period costume ball, street parades, foot and bicycle races etc. It is therefore necessary that a co-ordinating committee be set up in Burra, where the train will arrive on 3 May 1986 and be open for inspection on 4 &amp; 5 May, departing on 6 May. Public Relations Officer for the Trade Train, Andre Willcox will be in Burra on 17 June 1985 to discuss the aims of the Trade Train Committee for May 1986. Opportunities are almost limitless, so you are urged to attend this important meeting.</p>

<p>Burra Community Sports Club: President Graham Kellock’s report for 1984-85.</p>
<p>This year was one of consolidation. With two year’s experience for the bar licence and the Ladies’ Auxiliary, matters have settled into a routine based on experience. Teas after football home matches and monthly in summer have proved popular. The Ladies’ Auxiliary has also been catering successfully for 3 weddings, 1 clearing sale, monthly Council teas, Dalgety Bennet Farmers and Elders IXL promotional evenings. They have used their income to upgrade facilities. The Bar Committee has erred $5,400 to the main committee. Other fundraising continues – especially the rubbish contract, which has been negotiated for another year. Barley cropping brought in $8,600. The sheep haven’t made money yet, but with lambs at foot and shearing due, the future looks promising. A crop has been sown for next year. Gum trees at the north end of the oval have been pollarded, more trees planted and we are investigating resurfacing the netball courts.</p>

<p>The J150 Grant and the Copper Interpretation Centre</p>
<p>In 1983 the Premier announced a grant of $470,000 to Burra as part of three major J150 projects in SA.</p>
<p>The total was divided up:</p>
<p>$150,000 for restoration of the Kingston Street Row of Paxton Cottages</p>
<p>$30,000 for restoration work at the Bon Accord Mine Site</p>
<p>$80,000 for restoration of Morphett’s Pump House</p>
<p>$210,000 for a Copper Interpretation Centre</p>
<p>A J150 Steering Committee has been meeting monthly this year to organise the spending of the remaining grant money. As reported recently in both the Northern Argus and the Advertiser problems have dogged the project. The major problem being the cost of the Copper Interpretation Centre, which on tendering proved to be double the architect’s cost estimate.</p>
<p>As a consequence building the centre on the mine plateau as a new building was deemed unfeasible and on 16 August the committee asked the architect to quit the project.</p>
<p>Since then the J150 Board in Adelaide has been threatening to reallocate the grant for the centre because it believes the money cannot be spent in time.</p>
<p>Contact has been made with the Premier, Mr Bannon, members of the Government and the Opposition and several visits have been made to Adelaide by members of Council and press reports have been prepared.</p>
<p>Council believes the money can and should be spent in Burra and that reallocation would be grossly wrong. As the money is a Federal grant any change would have to be approved by the Premier and then by the Federal Government. Council has protested at both those levels. Mr Bannon has called for a report.</p>
<p>Council has been calling repeatedly for another meeting of the Steering Committee to clarify the matter, but so far no date has been set, though it is hoped it will occur soon.</p>
<p>Burra’s unique significance was acknowledged by the initial grant. We know the importance of the town’s history to the state and Commonwealth and to enable the preservation and interpretation of what we have it is essential we retain the grant allocation. You can help by:</p>

Another is interested in the role of the church in the reformatory and town.

<p>John G. Reed writes re a public meeting recently.</p>
<p>At the meeting he was disappointed to find references to ‘fly-by-nighters’. He makes the point that while there are people who have lived in Burra all their lives and have dedicated much time to the community; it is also true to say that many local organisations are dependent on the time and service given by the so-called ‘fly-by-nighters’ – the teachers, police officers, stock agents, bank staff and so forth. His views are supported by a note signed by Colin J. Fidock and Roger C. Henderson.</p>
<p>Burra National Trust supplies a note outlining its position on the Market Square redevelopment plan. They were not opposed to redevelopment provided there was sufficient consultation and advice from the relevant heritage bodies. This does not mean support for the present plan because that had no heritage input. The provision placed on the CEP grant that the work not proceed until approval of the Heritage Branch and the National Trust had been obtained would seem to be sufficient protection.</p>

<p>The Ian Auhl Burra History Collection</p>
<p>The Burra Burra DC has recently acquired this collection, which will be housed and administered by the Burra Community Library Board of Management, led by Chief Librarian Colin Fidock. The collection includes:</p>
<p>An indexed collection of newspaper references to the Burra Burra Mine and its townships 1845-77.</p>
<p>A biographical index of names of people mentioned in those references.</p>
<p>A collection of maps related to Burra &amp; District.</p>
<p>Collection of photographs relating to same.</p>
<p>Collection of books relating to Burra.</p>
<p>Other miscellaneous resources and indexes to Burra Burra Mine and its townships.</p>
<p>The collection began when Mr Auhl published the Burra Sketchbook in 1969. It grew with the compilation of the Burra Conservation Study in 1978 and with each of the various histories Mr Auhl has written and the submissions for the District Council, information for tourist publications and for the heritage listing of Burra buildings. Especially it grew with the research for Mr Auhl’s major work The Story of the Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-77, to be published later this year.</p>
<p>It had originally been intended to deposit the collection at the State Copper Museum-Interpretation Centre, funding for which was granted from Jubilee 150. When it became apparent that this funding is now uncertain arrangements were made for it to be deposited in the Burra Community Library in the care of the Library Board.</p>

<p>Burra Preservation Organisation</p>
<p>The plan to redevelop Market Square has polarised Burra people into three groups:</p>
<p>The Burra Burra DC, which supports the plan in its entirety.</p>
<p>The National Trust, which supports some redevelopment.</p>
<p>Those totally opposed.</p>
<p>Because the third group could achieve nothing individually the Burra Preservation Organisation was formed, so they would be listened to. This group:</p>
<p>Endorses the undergrounding of power lines and the rearrangement of lighting on a plan yet to be devised.</p>
<p>Totally opposes any change in the layout of the square and Commercial Street.</p>
<p>The membership is currently 270 and the group will continue to act as a watchdog over Burra’s heritage.</p>

<p>Market Square</p>
<p>On 21 February the Executive Committee of the Burra Burra DC went to Adelaide for a meeting chaired by Mr John Womersley of the State heritage Conservation Branch to discuss Market Square redevelopment. At Mr Womersley’s request representatives of the Burra National Trust and the Burra Preservation Society attended as observers – represented by Mrs Maureen Wright and Mr Gerry O’Connor respectively. There were representatives from the State heritage Branch, the Highways Department, the Road traffic Board and the Urban Conservation Committee of the National Trust of South Australia.</p>
<p>The Council produced a plan of the square, which it had approved. In the course of discussion the Council agreed to retain the existing curved kerb line, to remove the proposed protuberance from the north side of Commercial Street adjacent to the ANZ Bank and in place of proposed protuberances on the south side of Commercial Street, to incorporate slightly raised areas for the existing roadway, which would be outlined with a painted line. State heritage will now allow the plan to proceed on the basis of this agreement.</p>
<p>Council also agreed to look into the matter of lighting and to resolve this issue within the next two weeks.</p>
<p>J150 Book Project</p>
<p>The BCS Council has endorsed a book writing project in conjunction with the State’s Jubilee Year. All the children of each family attending the district’s schools will be asked to write down some aspects of their family’s history or stories of the family from today or the past. Contributions from every school aged member of the family are requested and co-operation of families will result in a record of the community’s history. The book is due for publication in October. As a consequence, volunteer typists, sub-editors and proof readers are being sought. Companies are being approached for financial support.</p>
<p>Burra &amp; Booborowie-Hallett Football and Netball Clubs have amalgamated. This is revealed in a note on the operation of the Burra Community Sports Club Inc. It is pointed out that membership of the football or netball clubs does not make a person a member of the Sports Club. One must be a member, or be signed in by a member, or be an honorary member, to drink at the club. Previously Booborowie-Hallett players or officials were honorary members for the day, as they were Burra’s visitors. With the amalgamation of the clubs, this is no longer the case.</p>
<p>Ian Auhl was born in Burra in 1914 and developed an abiding interest in the preservation of the architectural heritage of this historic mining town when he returned to Burra as Principal of Burra Primary School. He became deeply involved in moves to acquire and preserve the town’s historic buildings and has researched, written and lectured extensively on the history of the area. He is an Associate of the University of Adelaide and has been a member of the Council of the National Trust of SA. Mr Auhl now lives in Modbury and since his retirement has written a history of the District of Tea Tree Gully, commissioned by the Corporation of the City of Tea Tree Gully. In 1975 Ian Auhl and Denis Marfleet produced a widely acclaimed book Australia’s Earliest Mining Era, South Australia 1841-51, which incorporated the paintings of S.T. Gill. He is married with two children and five grandchildren.</p>
<p>Jubilee 150 Scale Model of the Burra Mine Project.</p>
<p>Initial work has been carried out in preparation for the display of the model. Since mid-January the basic framework has been almost completed. The display area is 5 x 6.5 metres. Thirty-three groups of buildings will slot into the landscape to show how the mine looked in 1860. The landscape around the models will be completed by May.</p>
<p>Pam Marlow’s family will be moving from Aldgate to Pinnaroo this year, which will limit her on site work to school holidays. The display will be glazed before September to enable fitting of the models and final finishing in time for the opening of the Bon Accord Mine Museum in October.</p>

<p>D. Rayfield, writes as Secretary of the Burra Preservation Society.</p>
<p>Last week’s article on the Market Square meeting did not reflect a clear picture of the events prior to or at the meeting. Burra Burra DC at its February meeting nominated the Council personnel to attend. It was Mr Womersley’s prerogative as chairman to determine how the meeting was structured. Council Chairman Mr J. Hawker invited the Burra Preservation Organisation Chairman Mr G. O’Connor to attend, but had to withdraw the invitation when Council considered only those nominated in the Council minute could attend. Mrs M. Wright of the National Trust and Mr G. O’Connor nevertheless presented themselves at the meeting. Mr Womersley had a brief consultation with Mr Hawker and then allowed both to attend and participate fully. We note that although Council has agreed to retain the existing curved kerb line, they do intend to close off the existing roadway, an action that very effectively destroys the 140-year-old character of Market Square. This was not made clear in the last issue of Community News.</p>
<p>Burra Guides and Brownies have had to re-schedule their AGM to 11 March due to poor attendance at the meeting called for last week.</p>

<p>Anonymous writes: Point of View</p>
<p>In calling on the Council to hold a poll or survey of residents on the Market Square question the writer makes the following points:</p>
<p>Dismay at the splitting of the town into factions</p>
<p>Dismay at the attitudes shown at the National Trust meeting of 20 March by various new members</p>
<p>It is time to stop saying ‘I am right’ on an emotional level and to start asking what is best for the town on a logical basis</p>
<p>Council needs to admit it made a grave error of judgement in not recognising fully the heritage value of the square</p>
<p>Concessions made since have only been made under extreme pressure</p>
<p>The National Trust was slow to recognise the threat to the square</p>
<p>The Burra Preservation Committee supposedly has a large following, but is not recognised by Council, perhaps because of its inconsistencies and emotional approach</p>
<p>Council needs to acknowledge it is elected to govern on behalf of the people; not to rule over them</p>
<p>All deserve a say, but should be willing then to abide by the majority decision.</p>

<p>Burra Civic Jubilee Ball</p>
<p>The Governor and Lady Dunstan arrived at 9 p.m. and were welcomed by the Chairman of the Council, James Hawker, and his wife Penny and a good crowd that had assembled on the footpath. They were introduced to Councillors and the Ball Committee. The Governor in his speech said that his great great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and the family had at one time lived in the dugouts, so his Burra connection was real and meaningful. He was presented with a copy of Ian Auhl’s new book as a memento of his visit.</p>
<p>Many people attended in period costume. Before leaving at 11 p.m. the Governor cut the Jubilee Cake with his sword. The whole evening was a very great success.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>Several residents and groups have expressed concerns that the SA Health Commission’s Area Health Plans could result in the loss or reduction of obstetric, acute care and surgical services from Burra Hospital. To date Burra Hospital personnel have received no information from the Health Commission on this. Plans to reduce surgical and obstetric services in the Barossa Valley and Upper North Country Areas were met with strong opposition and were subsequently modified to the satisfaction of all concerned. The Board of Burra Burra Hospital and staff concerned will reject any plans to remove or reduce present services. Such moves would:</p>
<p>Reduce facilities, qualified staff and job opportunities and emergency services.</p>
<p>Reduce availability (or loss) of local medical practitioners.</p>
<p>Greatly increase travelling expenses and trauma for surgical and obstetric patients and their families.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital seems likely to be affected by Government plans to reduce obstetric and neonatal services in country hospitals. A discussion paper presented by Dr S. Britton on behalf of a steering committee has suggested this and it would see these services transferred to Clare Hospital. Many of the statistics in the paper have been manipulated to this end. This move could be a forerunner to the loss of acute care, emergency services and surgery. Burra Hospital would then be little more than a nursing home with resultant loss of skilled staff and doctors. If you are concerned at this prospect the time to react is now. The Board of Management wishes to ensure that all existing services are maintained. Copies of Dr Britton’s report can be seen at the Hospital, the Council Office and the Community Library. Submissions or letters should be sent to Dr S. Britton, the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition or the Minister of Health.</p>

The Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Cr Jack McMahon welcomed everyone and outlined the history of the project. Mr Kym Bonython, chairman of the Jubilee 150 Board, spoke of the significance of the State’s Jubilee celebrations and of how diverse they had been and how much the people of South Australia had joined in with the spirit of the sesquicentenary. The honour of opening the project went to Mr Keith Jones, the Director-General of the Department of Mines and Energy, representing the Minister, the Hon. R.G. Payne.</p>
<p>Mr Johns is a descendant of Mr Thomas Roberts, the first Captain of the Burra Burra Mine. He spoke of the three components – Morphett’s Engine House, the Bon Accord Mine Site and Museum and the Kingston Street Row of the Paxton Square Cottages. As well as funding from J150, grants have also come from the Department of Mines &amp; Energy, the Department of Tourism and the Department of Environment and Planning. Just as the project was declared open heavy rain fell, but later it cleared sufficiently for the crowd to travel from site to site.</p>

<p>After several meetings in 1985 and negotiations, the amalgamation of Booborowie-Hallett and Burra Football Clubs came about and the first year of the BBH Club has been successful. Membership stands at 169 members, more than both the two original clubs put together. Players and officials from both clubs have worked together. Congratulations to coaches Richard Riggs and Colin Hall for achieving premierships for the B Grade and the Senior Colts sides respectively. The Junior Colts with Coach Robin Eberhard came 3rd. The A Grade side with Coach John Hall achieved good comradeship and teamsmanship even if the premiership was not within their grasp this year. The Ladies’ Auxiliary has continued their great work and the Social Club under President David Schell made a commendable profit of $12,160.38. During the year $7,000 was spent on extra oval lighting. Complete sets of jumpers for all grades cost over $2,000 and medical supplies accounted for about $1,500. [Thanks are also extended to a range of people.]</p>

<p>Burra Creek Pumping</p>
<p>Stream gauging in the creek has revealed a water loss of 18% between the bore No. 1 opposite Peacock’s Chimney and bore No. 2 adjacent to the BCS Agricultural Block.

The rest of the waterway may develop algal growth due to reduced flow, but this is relatively harmless to creek fauna.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Hospital Board is concerned at budget cuts due to lack of funding by the SA Health Commission. The Commission has warned:</p>
<p>The projected budget over-run of $20,000 will not be assisted by Central Office Funds.</p>
<p>It will become the first charge against next year’s fund.</p>
<p>A 100% penalty may be imposed on any over-run.</p>
<p>A further 1 to 2% cut may be applied next financial year.</p>
<p>Anyone (or more) of the above would spell disaster for the retention of services. Please write to health authorities or Government representatives to support the hospital.</p>
<p>Barrow Push. The ‘Collinsville Rams’ were a much depleted team for the 116 km Medindie [sic: for Menindee] to Broken Hill ‘Lake to Lode’ barrow push on 8 March. Lack of members caused them to change to the shorter 60 km ‘Quondong to the Hill’ section. The team came fifth, which was good considering Mick Kessell sustained a serious knee injury and had to be taken to Broken Hill by ambulance and Jim Robinson also had a knee injury that restricted his running to short bursts, leaving the heavy work to Gary James, Darren James, Graham Kessell and Tim Crowder.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC. At the meeting of 11 May Cr John William McMahon was elected Chairman for a term of two years. Cr Graham Malcolm Kellock was elected Deputy Chairman for the same term.</p>
<p>Council has advertised their intension of changing the method of assessment for 1987-88 from Site Value to Capital Value. As more than 10% of the electors have objected to this a poll will be held on Saturday 13 June to decide the issue. Polling Places:</p>
<p>Burra Civic Centre</p>
<p>Farrell Flat Institute</p>
<p>Booborowie Soldiers’ Memorial Hall</p>
<p>Mt Bryan Institute</p>
<p>Capital Value Assessment</p>
<p>Current market value of a property, including all improvements except trees grown for ornamental purposes or shelters.</p>
<p>Site Value</p>
<p>Current market value of the land without improvements. These include buildings and structures, wells, dams and reservoirs and trees planted for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>Advantages of Site Value</p>
<p>Healthy and orderly development is encouraged as improvements are not subject to a penalty through tax.</p>
<p>Only the ‘unearned increment’ is taxed, leaving the individual’s expenditure on capital and labour untouched.</p>
<p>Speculative withholding of land is discouraged as rate payment is the same whether developed or not.</p>
<p>Redevelopment of urban land does not attract a penalty and so redevelopment of neglected urban areas is encouraged.</p>
<p>Higher density is encouraged in urban areas, making more efficient use of land.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Site Value</p>
<p>It reinforces the regressiveness of rating and results in even less regard for the owner’s ability to pay.</p>
<p>Residential properties tend to pay an excessive proportion of rates compared to the residential uses. [Sic: should this not be ‘to the non-residential uses’?]</p>
<p>Determination of site values tends to be hypothetical, based on an analysis of improved sales less an estimate for improvements. In turn assessments on site values are thus more expensive and less accurate.</p>
<p>Advantages of Capital Value</p>
<p>Allows a closer relationship to the owner’s ability to pay, to the extent that property assets reflect taxable capacity.</p>
<p>Commercial, industrial and higher density properties tend to contribute a higher proportion of rate income.</p>
<p>Capital values are based on sales evidence of comparable properties, reducing the need to resort to hypothesis.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Capital Value</p>
<p>Improvements are discouraged through higher rates being payable.</p>
<p>It encourages holding land for speculative purposes as rates are lower.</p>
<p>Rates fall unevenly on developed property compared to vacant land.</p>
<p>It creates greater Council dependency on minimal rates.</p>

<p>Burra Swimming Pool Management Committee</p>
<p>Annual Report of President John Barton</p>
<p>This year the committee had to work within a set Council budget of $7,000.</p>
<p>The coldest summer for many years restricted income and in 92 days of operation we took $3,537.40.</p>
<p>Adults numbered 706 or 7.5 per day and children numbered 4,500 or 49 per day.</p>
<p>Pensioners and unemployed were 47 or 0.5 per day and there were 366 spectators or 4 per day.</p>
<p>The cost of the supervisor-operator was $3,754.48, giving a deficit of $217.08. Painting the pool cost $3,500. We expect to end the year in deficit $1,500 over the Council’s budgeted deficit of $7,000 and this will come from the Swimming Pool Management Committee’s Fundraising Account. This is a good result considering the 1985-86 deficit was over $14,000. The out of hours swimming club got off the ground.</p>

<p>Burra School &amp; Community News</p>
<p>The BCS Council advises that the school printery, which produces this paper, will close on 30 June 1987.</p>
<p>An annual loss of $4,000 to $5,000 has been identified over the past two years. This has been generated despite the outstanding efforts of Trevor Walsham the printer, who has saved significant amounts by servicing the equipment himself. The cost of the Community News would also have been greater had the printer and his assistant not donated several hours work each week without charge.</p>
<p>The Education Department will thoroughly investigate the finance of the printery and eventually the machinery will be sold. A financial statement will then be made public. A joint committee of Finance &amp; Newspaper Committee and Apex Club members has met and agreed on a course of action for the paper.</p>
<p>The school will lease a large rapid photocopier, which will also print the paper. Burra Apex Club will continue to offer support. All this work will be done by volunteers with no wages paid. To make this venture a success donations will have to increase. Your support of your paper is now imperative.</p>

<p>Local History Room Opened</p>
<p>The first BCS Principal Mr Chris McCabe officially opened the room on 26 September. He was standing in for Mr Ian Auhl who was unable to attend, but who had prepared a thought provoking speech that Chris delivered – spiced with his own thoughts. He described Ian as a catalyst in the quest to record and preserve Burra’s History. Guests were welcomed by Sue Warnes, Chairperson of the Library Board who invited Colin Fidock to address the group. He took as his theme ‘People Make Local History’. He paid tribute to Ian and Evan Auhl and a number of others who had supported the preparation of the collection for use in this purpose-built room.</p>
<p>Chris McCabe presented a cheque for $500 to the Library Board from the Auhls for the provision of research and then cut a ribbon across the stairs leading to the room. Roger Henderson also spoke. As immediate past principal of BCS he had been strongly committed to the development of the rooms during his time in Burra. He presented the Board with two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall upstairs; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock. School Council member Helen Stockman announced that the Education Department had advised that it would fund the position of Educational Officer for Burra from 1988. Afternoon tea followed during which Colin Fidock cut a cake to mark the 9th birthday of the Community Library.</p>

<p>The Director of the CFS has announced that the CFS Board is to allocate a new vehicle to be housed in a suitable location in the Baldina Area at no cost to the Burra Burra DC. The Burra District Fire Fighting Association has also recommended to Council that three new Hino 4 x 4 two thousand litre appliances, fully equipped, be funded by Council as the CFS Board would contribute 70% of the capital cost. Council subsequently resolved to contribute $60,000 towards the cost of the vehicles by borrowing the sum by debenture loan over 5 years. The approximate value of the four appliances is $336,000. The appliances subsidised by Council will be located at Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan and Burra town areas and they are expected to be available by late April or May 1988. Present appliances will then be sold by tender either complete or with equipment tendered for separately.</p>

<p>Dianne Day is Burra’s Australia Day Senior Citizen of the Year.</p>
<p>She came to Burra as a new teacher in 1965 and immediately joined the sporting clubs and life of the town. At school she started athletics and founded a tradition for which Burra has become famous. She coached Cheryl Boswell (nee Finch) who went on to represent Australia. She is a foundation member of the Little Athletics Club. She is still a regular relief teacher and as a parent takes a great interest in the school and serves regularly on the school canteen. In netball she has held office on many occasions and is the club’s only Life Member. She has also held many Association positions. She has been a top umpire for many years. Dianne is Regional Vice-President of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital Auxiliary and a Past President of the local branch. She has been a voluntary typist for this newsletter since it started and has done ‘voluntary’ typing for many organisations and people in the town. Dianne is an Elder in the Burra Uniting Church, a Sunday school teacher and editor of the local church paper. She acted as trainer and mentor for the Burra Barrow Birds, seeing them reach Broken Hill. She is also one of the Tennis Club’s few Life Members, having held many offices in the club. Her main interest is now in promoting junior players. Dianne is also one of the town’s top golfers, having been President and Captain and is the zone handicap manager. At Burra Sports Complex Dianne was a foundation Member and for years was Treasurer and continues to be a hard working member of the Ladies’ Auxiliary.

<p>Burra Printing Press</p>
<p>Burra National Trust has decided to organise fundraising for the purchase of the Burra Printing Press and equipment dating from 1876. These historic items are for the benefit of the whole town. Their final resting place has yet to be determined. The asking price of $6,000 is well below market value.</p>
<p>[Donations to the value of $960 are acknowledged.]</p>
<p>[The printing press certainly did not date from 1876. The original hand press took an hour for three men to print one side of 250 copies. It was certainly replaced very early. In 1883 the business was totally destroyed by fire and new type and equipment procured. There was another extensive fire in 1910, which destroyed all the back premises, all the type and much equipment. It is true that the printing press survived another fire in 1935. Although undoubtedly old fashioned by 1977 when the paper closed, it was certainly not a century old.]</p>

<p>Andrew Kleinig is Burra Young Citizen of the Year for 1988.</p>
<p>Andrew has been a regular attender at Venturer meetings. He has been a regular communicant at his church and a church steward. His academic and athletic achievements are many. He regularly is a place getter in javelin, shot put, and discus as well as being a keen swimmer and lifesaver. In team sport he is a regular best player for the Rams Football Team. He is particularly notable for his Scouting interests. Andrew has successfully completed his Queen’s Scout Award; the highest award in Scouting. Andrew and another Venturer took on the extra task of assisting in the running of the local Cub Scout section when it had leadership problems. Wherever there is a need to assist someone or do a service to another person the cheerful and friendly face of Andrew Kleinig is there, ready to give time and effort without the thought of reward or commendation.</p>

<p>I am teaching one of the R-2 classes. I was trained in Junior Primary Teaching at Magill SACE. My home was at Ashton, a market gardening area near Norton Summit in the Adelaide Hills. I am the youngest of five children, having four sisters and one brother [sic!]. I have worked a great deal as a relief teacher in Adelaide and in the Hills Area and last year taught at Bordertown Area School and Coomandook Area School. I think Burra is by far the biggest and prettiest place I have taught in. I have a variety of hobbies – anything related to Art and craft, Aerobics, social tennis, squash and badminton, losing my keys and putting things on lay-by.</p>

<p>I am teaching Year 3 this year. My first teaching appointment was at Hallett Primary, which I enjoyed very much. I have also taught in Adelaide, at Athelstone Primary and at Farrell Flat last year. I am originally from Adelaide and my parents still live there. I have a brother living in Melbourne. I now live at Leighton on a farm with my husband, Chris. Living on a farm is quite a contrast with city living and I love it. I have a number of challenges, including redecorating the house, trying to establish a garden using water said to be suitable only for palm trees and couch grass, riding my bike on dirt roads without getting a puncture every time and working in the canteen during the football season.</p>

<p>Excavations at the White Hart Hotel Site</p>
<p>Archaeologist Parry Kostiglou has been investigating the site of the White Hart Hotel, built in the 1850s and destroyed by fire in 1916. He is working for the Burra National Trust on a project initiated by them and David Bannear to rescue archaeological evidence. The Highways Department is building the Ludgvan Street Deviation between the Broken Hill and Morgan Roads, which necessitates the demolition of the old Bushman’s Home Hotel (Fridd’s House), the shelter shed of the Croquet Club and also passes over the site of the White Hart Hotel. The Highways Department granted permission to carry out the rescue project before the roadway was laid and they have agreed to refund part of the cost if the report meets with Heritage Branch approval. Consequently much dirt has been moved around in the last fortnight and Parry returns this week to finish the work.</p>

<p>This has been supported by the Burra Burra DC and South Australian Tourism. There are ambitious plans to go hand in hand with this exciting venture.</p>
<p>Sign are to be unveiled at the main approaches to the town to the north, south and east.</p>
<p>Car stickers will be available.</p>
<p>The longest running series of Merino Field Days in Australia will follow the event: the first day being Monday 14 March. Thousands of sheepmen and women from all over Australia make the annual pilgrimage to the district to see the vast cross-section of the State’s Stud Merino industry displayed by stud masters. This concentration of studs in one area, resulting in a minimum of travel for visitors has great appeal. Of 353 studs in SA, 154 are in the Mid North. More than half stud sheep produced in SA are produced in the Mid North and Mid North studs account for three quarters of the rams sold. The number of rams sold represents 33% of the entire Australian Poll Merino Ram sales and 12.5% of Australian Merino ram sales.</p>
<p>BCS. Staff Profile: Mary Abbott</p>
<p>In transferring to BCS I am returning ‘home’. I was born in Burra Hospital and lived on our family farm at Farrell Flat. I attended primary school at Farrell Flat before going on to a boarding school. I began my teaching career at Poochera on the West Coast and then spent a year at Burra Primary in 1973. I then travelled overseas for a year and travel remains a great interest. On returning I spent twelve months in Pt Augusta before transferring to the City, where I have lived ever since. I am also interested in gardening, reading, music and racquet sports.</p>
<p>Interschool Swimming Carnival at Riverton, 22 February. Burra brought home all three shields.</p>
<p>They won the Championship Shield for the first time in nine years and the Improvement Shield for the first time in seven years. The new shield known as the Handicap Shield also went to BCS.</p>
<p>Among the many outstanding efforts, that of Karen Jennings stood out. She won six events from six starts. With the relays to come Burra was in third place, but the school won nine of the twelve to gain the outright victory.</p>
<p>At the SASSSA Carnival in Adelaide on 2 March at the North Adelaide Aquatic Centre BCS was elevated two divisions from last year. The girls won the shield and the boys finished fourth from eight. The outstanding competitor this time was 12-year-old Many Drew.</p>
<p>Burra National Trust held its AGM last Tuesday at the Civic Centre.</p>
<p>Chairperson, Maureen Wright, delivered her annual report, of which the main points were:</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Mine Museum has been the focus of much activity.</p>
<p>An application for a $20,000 CEP grant for maintenance work was successful.</p>
<p>New Fencing, tables and seats and paint for the Waterworks Building were enabled along with sundry smaller jobs.</p>
<p>Archaeologist David Bannear began work researching the history of the Bon Accord Mine site, partly funded by a Museum’s Accreditation Grant from the History Trust SA.</p>
<p>Bryan &amp; Donna Salter have relinquished their lease on the Bon Accord and we thank them for their promotion of the site and from running excellent and popular guided tours.</p>
<p>Burra Mine Museum Committee will now run the Bon accord site on a four month trial.</p>
<p>Donna Salter will continue to run the Bon Accord Cottage for the National Trust.</p>
<p>Curator Colin Fidock was farewelled at the end of 1987 when he and his family moved to Adelaide. Colin made an immense contribution to the branch, especially in getting up the displays at the Market Square Museum, the Bon Accord and Malowen Lowarth.</p>
<p>We have recently nominated Colin for the BHP Awards for the Pursuit of Excellence for Services to the Community.</p>
<p>During the year Registrar Curator Shirley Thamm has completed the cataloguing of all items held in storage by us and she is planning a special display of items for Heritage Week in April.</p>
<p>In December the large eighteenth century painting entitled Peter’s Vision, held in storage by our branch for many years, was cleaned at the State Conservation Centre and presented to St Mary’s Anglican Church, Burra to be hung there on permanent loan.</p>
<p>The sudden death in late January of Artley Josephs, our odd jobs man, was a shock to all and he will be sadly missed.</p>
<p>This year the spending of the Commonwealth Bank grant of $50,000 on the work at Redruth Gaol will soon begin. This will include a new toilet block and car park as well as conservation work on the building. The opening ceremony for the Gaol will be on the 24 May and promises to be a spectacular event, attended by the Governor and his wife, the Police Band, members of the Police Historical Society in period uniform and on horseback and the restored horse-drawn Black Maria. The local Venturer Group is planning a retrial of Breaker Morant at about the same time.</p>
<p>Currently the branch is employing archaeologist Parry Kostoglou for rescue archaeological work at the White Hart Hotel site, the Aberdeen Croquet Club and the Bushman’s Home site. The Highways Department has promised a partial reimbursement of the cost.</p>
<p>Office bearers elected for 1988: Chairman, Maureen Wright; Vice-Chairman (Management), Helen Stockman; Vice-Chairman (Works &amp; Buildings), Barry Wright; Vice-Chairman (Fundraising &amp; Catering), Sue Scholz; Secretary, James Hawker; Treasurer, Sue Langford and Curators, Shirley Thamm &amp; Sue Langford.</p>

<p>Nominations received: Page, Robyn Len</p>
<p>Smith, Clement Howard</p>
<p>A poll will be held on 19 March</p>
<p>Profiles of the candidates:</p>
<p>Robyn Page</p>
<p>Aged 35, married with one son and have lived in Burra for six years. Currently:</p>
<p>Member of Lewis board of Management</p>
<p>Member of Swimming Pool Management Committee</p>
<p>Editor of the Community Newsletter</p>
<p>Member of Burra Branch of the National Trust</p>
<p>Attended Copper Festival Meetings</p>
<p>Member of the Burra &amp; District Crippled Children’s Auxiliary</p>
<p>Part time teacher at BCS</p>
<p>I am anxious to support the retention of full services at the Burra Hospital and to see better day care facilities and aged hostel accommodation. I believe Council should support local business and industry and make efficient use of Council plant, staff and services. I would seek the regular promotion of Council matters to the community and favour the development of the tourist industry.</p>
<p>Clement Howard Smith</p>
<p>Aged 58 and semi-retired married man with two children. I moved from Hawker eighteen months ago, where I owned Rawnsley Park – a sheep property adjacent to Wilpena Pound. It is still held by my family. We entered upon tourism in 1968 and Rawnsley Park now has eight self-contained cabins and a caravan park. I learnt much that affects the traveller and I guided tours for fourteen years. If elected I would work for the bituminising of the Morgan-Burra Road, support the plan to make Burra the Merino Capital of the World, to at least retain present hospital services and seek Government assistance at controlling the earwig menace. I have served twelve years on the Great Northern War Memorial Hospital at Hawker and for two years there as a Town Councillor. Burra’s history and stone buildings have impressed me and I would endeavour to retain this part of Burra’s Heritage. My main interests are gardening, bowls and golf.</p>

<p>I am teaching Year 7 at BCS. For the past ten years I have lived at Hahndorf. I received most of my primary education in the Adelaide suburbs and began secondary education in a country area school with Years 11 &amp; 12 at a private school in Adelaide. I then completed a Diploma in Teaching at Magill CAE with major studies in Expressive Arts – Dance &amp; Music. For fifteen years I have participated in Dance through Dalcrose Eurhythmics with wide experience also in tap, social, creative, ballroom, aerobic dance, dance drama and religious dance. I play many instruments, namely piano, flute, guitar and recorder. I perform contemporary Christian music in the Balhannah Uniting Church Musical Group ‘Access’. I also enjoy cooking and sewing. I have been actively involved in netball and tennis clubs as a player, senior and junior coach and qualified Association umpire.</p>

<p>I have just completed a Bachelor of Education at Sturt CAE, majoring in Drama-English and Science. I am currently teaching a range of subjects from Year 8 &amp; 9 English to R-2 Drama &amp; Science. I was born and raised in Adelaide and I am finding the history behind Burra very interesting. For fifteen years I have been involved with netball and basketball and this year I am coaching the C1 &amp; C2 netball teams and playing for the BBH team. I also enjoy dancing, bike riding and water skiing.</p>

<p>I began teaching French in 1972 at Balmoral in Western Victoria. At first mortified to be sent away from Melbourne, friends, family and sports, it turned out to be the first in a series of rewarding postings in rural and regional communities: Neerim in West Gippsland, Tanlouse in Southern France and Independence in Iowa. There were also two years at Parkdale H.S. (Melbourne) and four years at Christies Beach H.S. in SA. I an enjoying teaching French here, especially at Primary level – a new experience and I am settling in with my wife Carol and son David (31⁄2).</p>

<p>The Redruth Gaol Project will be opened by the Governor Sir Donald Dunstan &amp; Lady Dunstan on Tuesday 24 May. The Police Band, the mounted police and an old horse-drawn Black Maria and the Police Historical Society will make for a colourful ceremony.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Bank has sponsored the project, which included the repair and repointing of stone walls, recapping of chimneys with slate, painting of all blocks and repairing of worn floorboards and the construction of car and bus parks and a toilet block for visitors. The gaol was built in 1856 and was the first in SA outside metropolitan Adelaide. It has been a gaol, a private residence, a girls’ reformatory and a derelict ruin. Recently it achieved fame as the site for much of the filming of Breaker Morant. In 1977 it was given to the custody of the National Trust. The opening ceremony will be held in front of the gaol at 11 a.m. and the public is invited to attend, but attendance at the lunch to follow is by invitation only. The entire population of BCS has been invited to dress in period costume and will attend the opening ceremony. The public is also invited to dress in period costume, though this is not essential.</p>
<p>Bicentennial Day. An illustration of children’s costumes is given and an address for the hire of the same is also provided.</p>
<p>The Burra Heritage Advisor’s position is almost a year old and the Heritage Advisor reports on the work. [Though without providing his name. He was Douglas Alexander.]</p>
<p>He had found Burra delightful and unique from its setting to its lovely streetscapes, from large and significant buildings and mines to individual row cottages.</p>
<p>While most locals seem to recognise the town’s rich heritage, some seem to fear being caught in a time warp, unresponsive to present day needs and technology.</p>
<p>Heritage does not mean turning Burra into a museum town to be viewed through a display case.</p>
<p>At the recent ICOMOS conference it was acknowledged that conservation and tourism strategies should work together and that both can generate economic activity, employment and income.</p>
<p>Planning is needed to ensure that the town’s rich heritage is protected and one such project has been the Unicorn Brewery Cellars Conservation Study. Ian Auhl has provided access to his research notes and publications on these fascinating structures. David Bannear and friends have undertaken a preliminary archaeological survey and we have undertaken our own extensive architectural measured survey. We are now well placed to produce a report.</p>
<p>As well as advising on heritage buildings I am currently producing a series of information sheets intended to assist people with colour schemes, repairs, trouble-shooting, verandahs, signs, additions, alterations etc.</p>
<p>As an architect I am well aware of the dilemmas posed by conservation work and realise that frustration and delay is an inevitable part of a careful, well considered process.</p>
<p>New buildings should not aim to recreate old buildings, but should be sympathetic to the scale and streetscapes of Burra.</p>

The club also regretfully accepted the resignation of Chairman Glen Ward and member Pat Greet. Office bearers this year: Chairman, Peter Reilly; Vice-Chairman, H. Bernhard; Secretary, D. Parnell and Treasurer, M. Reed.</p>

Jane visited The Lodge and met Mrs Hazel Hawke [The Prime Minister’s wife] with nine other students from SA. The representatives from BCS were two of a group of twenty selected from SA after winning a competition.</p>

<p>Burra Community &amp; Sports Club AGM Report from President R.W. Secomb.</p>
<p>It has been a relatively quiet year for expenditure. We have built a new coach’s box on the oval for $2.216 and sealed the ‘new’ netball court with a Colour Court preparation for $3,008. The Hanson Soldiers’ Memorial Hall Committee has generously loaned their piano to the Sports Club. The Ladies Auxiliary has been busy with catering and raised over $7,000 above their own requirements and this has been transferred to our funds. Trevor Wall has again done a great job as the bar manager and has handed over nearly $7,500 to the General Committee. We have 250 sheep on Redbanks Reserve and have tailed approximately 250 lambs so this should return a worthwhile income.</p>
<p>Elected were: President, Paul Wilson; Vice-President, Jeff White; Secretary, Cynthia Robinson; Treasurer, Di Day and Administrator, Des James.</p>

<p>Coppertown Festival</p>
<p>The 1988 Festival was a success with an estimated profit of $1,500. Expenses involved with funding the festival were about $6,000. Because the numbers attending were down due to many outside circumstances and a general lack of community support, the committee, whose involvement is purely voluntary, have decided to go into indefinite recess. Funds will be invested, some of which will go into a community project as the need arises. Chris Reed, Co-ordinator and Elly Nicholls, Secretary.</p>

<p>Last year I was the Reception/Year 1 teacher at Melrose Primary School. This year I will be replacing Robyn Page as Special Education Teacher Year R-7, while she is on leave. My other ‘hats’ involve releasing teachers for duties other than teaching and curriculum development. I enjoy sports, e.g. horse riding and golf. I have a special interest in drama and in 1988 joined the Patchwork Players (Booleroo Centre) to participate in My Fair Lady. I play the piano and folk guitar. Last year I used skills that I had developed as a past member of the Pembroke Girls’ Choir and Pembroke Choral Society to reform the Melrose Primary School Choir.

<p>Burra Australia day Citizen of the Year Awards</p>
<p>Len &amp; Susan Hentschke were joint winners this year. The citations for them emphasised their work in the Senior Citizens Club and their enduring interest in the KESAB Tidy Towns Competition. Len was the inaugural Chairman of Senior Citizens in Burra and has spent six of nine years as a member in that position. Sue has been a staunch member for this period. The couple has spent countless hours planting, watering and weeding the beautiful gardens thay and other senior citizens have created on the banks of the Burra creek. Another KESAB project has been the creating and maintenance of a garden area opposite Burra Hospital. Both are dedicated members of the Lutheran Church and they helped in erecting the Nativity Scene in Market Square each year. They have attended the Day Care Centre and give talks and demonstrations when requested at BCS. Their favourite topic is old fashioned sausage making. Len was Councillor for the Bright Ward for the Robertstown Council for fifteen years and was given a service award when he retired to live in Burra. Sue’s other interests included eight years as a member of the CWA. The couple have three daughters and spent many years farming at World’s End before retiring to Burra. Sue’s interests include knitting, reading, gardening and caring for the sick and elderly. Len’s interests also include helping others.</p>

<p>Burra Printing Press</p>
<p>Last year the appeal to raise funds for the purchase of the Burra Record printing equipment and other relics saw about $4,200 raised – a shortfall of $1,800. Recently the Advertiser Newspaper Limited donated $1,800, which has been received on behalf of the town by the National Trust Chairperson Maureen Wright to complete this important historical purchase and secure the collection for Burra. The donation followed a suggestion from Burra resident David Bunney that the Advertiser be approached. It is hoped some time in the future to set it up and have it working again. It is certainly a valuable collection.</p>

<p>411th Regional Cadet Unit</p>
<p>Parent support is needed at the Parent Fundraising Committee meetings. While support has been obtained when volunteers are needed, it has been lacking at committee meetings. To keep the unit going requires a minimum of about $2,500 p.a. Due to a low bank balance it was decided to charge a subscription this term. Since then there has been a substantial decline in cadet numbers. If insufficient people attend the next meeting to form a committee, discuss a constitution and consider future fundraising subscriptions will have to increase with a foreseeable further decline in cadet numbers and perhaps the collapse of the unit. I would not like either of these outcomes, but a club of this size cannot be run by the three officers alone, which you seem to expect.</p>
<p>The next meeting is at 7 p.m. on 20 June in the old Courthouse.</p>

<p>Women in the Mid North 1900-1950. Research by Bernie Fahey, BCS Year 12 History.</p>
<p>My grandmother Bridget Hollitt was born in 1899 and went to Teachers’ Training College in Currie Street, Adelaide. After only three weeks she was appointed as a teacher. She did not want to be a teacher, but there was no choice. My other grandmother Ralda Fahey was a live-in helper when she was 17, for 15 shillings a week. She worked 12 hours a day with no days off, but an occasional weekend free.</p>
<p>Mrs Gladys Slatter worked as a telephonist at Hallett when 19 or 20. Every morning she had to ring all the town subscribers to check that the telephones were working. There were three girls who worked in shifts and men took over at night. For full-time workers the wage was c. £3 a week. Women had to leave this job when they married or turned 21.</p>
<p>Mrs Olly Pohlner trained to be a teacher. At Peterborough H.S. she earned £5 per fortnight. When she was a student at Woodville H.S. boys and girls were strictly divided. On the train to school girls rode in the back carriages and the boys in the front one. Girls walked on the left hand side of the footpath and boys on the right hand side. Girls were not allowed to talk to boys.</p>
<p>Mrs Maggie Quinn began primary school at Willalo when aged 6 and then went to the Convent in Terowie, which was a boarding school for girls from all over SA. The nuns were very strict, but the girls got a good education.</p>
<p>Mrs Nellie Brooks attended the Spalding Convent, which had five teaching nuns who were also very strict. During the depression her family lived on rabbiting and rations for more than two years.</p>
<p>Jacki Green has returned to Burra and started work at Elders Genetic Services. Her parents, Adrian &amp; Chris run the Burra Garden Centre.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC Supplementary Election. Candidate Profiles:</p>
<p>Ronald John Shipard</p>
<p>Aged 53 and have lived in the Burra District for 30 years, having farmed at Hanson for 23 years. I recently retired to 10 Queen street after several years farming in the Nyngan District of NSW. Have been involved in the Burra &amp; Hanson Tennis Clubs, Farrell Flat and Burra Golf Clubs, Agricultural Bureau at Hanson, BCS, Burra Show Society and St Mary’s Church. My aim is to make Burra a cleaner and healthier place to live and work in and would like to see the district get more value for money spent.</p>
<p>John G. Monfries</p>
<p>Aged 41 and an accountant and registered taxation agent. I am employed by the Adelaide Chemical Co. as the Operation Accountant. My wife and I moved to Burra in 1987 as full time residents, when I was engaged by an accounting and taxation practice in Clare before taking my present position. I understand the needs of the farming and grazing sectors in the community, having previously been a manager of a grazing and stud property in the South East and also through accountancy. My involvement as Treasurer of the National Trust Branch has led me to believe that for Burra to continue to grow and develop in an orderly manner there must be a balance between development, tourism and heritage. We should be looking at ways of providing quality jobs for our young. Council needs to communicate with the community and I would favour a regular Council Newsletter. I believe I have distinctive skills that can assist Council to be a more productive institution.</p>
<p>Roger Burford</p>
<p>Hard machine compositor and proprietor of SA’s Country Trader (covering Smithfield to Quorn) and have 19 years’ experience in printing and allied trades. With new printing equipment the Trader and the commercial side of our business is in a position to expand. Since living in Mt Bryan I have come to see the need of taking an interest and involvement in Federal, State and Local Government. I believe that if the Fabian Socialist Governments of the day at Federal and State levels are returned to office, we may witness the greatest attack ever made on our local government system. I believe small local governments are capable of meeting best the individual needs of ratepayers and businesses and so should be kept local.</p>

<p>Moxham Family History. Research by Sharon Greet, BCS Year 12 History.</p>
<p>My interest in family history was sparked in 1987 when Germaine Greer wrote to my grandfather whom she mistook for Mr F.T. Greer, rather than F.T. Greet.</p>
<p>The Moxham name is of Irish origin. It probably relates to people of the moors or a gypsy type of people who lived on the moors:</p>
<p>Moors Hamlet</p>
<p>Mocs Hamlet</p>
<p>Moxhams</p>

<p>The Status of Women in Burra District 1880-1940. Research by Tanya Liebenau, BCS Year 12 History.</p>
<p>In 1900 there were three times as many men as women in paid employment. Women were employed as teachers, storekeepers and hotel keepers.</p>
<ol start="1920">
<li>
<p>The population of Burra was 1751 – 832 males and 919 females.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>47% of deaths were males and 52% females, but 60% of males had obituaries in the Burra Record, while only 40% of women did.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By 1920 almost 50% of males and females who died had more than one obituary. [How does this fit with point 3?]</p>
<p>Obituaries for men tended to be significantly longer than for men throughout the period.</p>
<p>On headstones in Burra Cemetery 1880-1940 more information is recorded for men irrespective of marital status.</p>
<p>Changes in Burra from 1860s to 1890s. Research by Brenton Stocker, BCS Year 12 History.</p>
<p>During the 1860s there was a measles outbreak that was responsible for the death of an average five children per day. [This is an extraordinary claim if it is for Burra and would need a date range to be possible. In August 1862 twenty-five children died at the peak of a measles outbreak.]</p>
<p>In 1860 potatoes were about 6/10 per 5 pound bag, bread 6 pence a loaf and mutton 1/2 per pound.</p>
<p>Thomas Phillips, appointed head blacksmith at the Burra Burra Mine died in May 1868. While working at the anvil he struck himself in the abdomen with a hammer. Two days later he was dead.</p>
<ol start="1890">
<li>Potatoes cost c. 9 shillings per 5 pound bag, bread was 17 pence per loaf and eggs about one shilling a dozen.</li>
</ol>

<p>Aberdeen Football Club</p>
<p>Past players of the club met to discuss the closing of the club and the disposal of its assets. The unanimous decision was to donate their property in Burra North to the Burra Burra DC with the suggestion it be used as a Care and Recreation Centre for the aged.</p>
<p>There are three provisions:</p>
<p>The transfer to be at no cost to the Football Club.</p>
<p>That it be used as an Aged Care and Recreation Centre.</p>
<p>That an archive area be set aside for the Aberdeen Football Club.</p>
<p>Since 1974 the premises have been maintained by the Women’s Committee led by Mrs Florrie Scroop. The proposal will go before Council on 12 December.</p>
<p>Athletics</p>
<p>Two local athletes have been selected for the 1989 Shell junior Talent Squad. This gives each $150 towards travel or equipment to be used by June 1990. Congratulations to Adam Day for the 400 m hurdles and to Cheryl Day for the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m events.</p>

<p>Burra Day Care Relocation</p>
<p>Contrary to rumours circulating the township at present:</p>
<p>Day Care is to be relocated from the Hospital soon to allow for upgrading of internal Hospital service areas and to permit Day Care to function as a true community, non-institutionalised centre.</p>
<p>The Hospital will continue to support the Day Care function and inpatients currently attending Day Care will be encouraged to attend any new venue.</p>
<p>No figure has yet been set as to costing to provide a new facility.</p>
<p>It is proposed that control of the new Day Care will be by a yet to be elected Committee or Board of Management.</p>
<p>If it is seen that more funds are required either for the relocation of the centre or for extras, a fundraising committee will be formed.</p>

<p>Re Kingston Street Bridge</p>
<p>The heritage value of this bridge means retention of its present style, construction and condition is vital. Any damage caused to the bridge would have to be repaired to the original state and the cost would be astronomical. Should the bridge be damaged the person who caused the damage would be held responsible for repair costs. Should the disregard for the load limit displayed continue, it might be necessary to close the bridge to all traffic or at least restrict it to one lane for Light Vehicles Only.</p>
<p>Baker &amp; Wooton Family History. Research by Tasma Wooton, BCS Year 12 History.</p>
<p>One of my great great-grandfathers, William Baker was born c. 1831 and arrived in Adelaide in 1845. In 1857 he married Mary Ann Webb (nee Bowden). William was a carpenter and labourer. William and Mary’s second child, William, lived only one week. My great-grandfather John Baker was born in 1858. In the 1880s he secured land at Moockra where he lived with his wife and children. Large herds of passing cattle used to be watered on the Baker farm, where they were spelled for a day or so. Rates were 1 penny per head of cattle, 2 pence per horse and 3 pence per camel. Nearby was an underground cellar used as the girls’ sleeping quarters. A boys’ room 20 feet x 10 feet was built from rolled out kerosene tins and pine posts. Seven daughters and three sons survived childhood.</p>
<p>Another great great-grandfather George Wooton was born in England in 1835. At the age of 12 he went to work for Queen Victoria in her stables. At 19 he migrated to Australia. Before he left the Queen gave him a number of gifts – a pipe rammer, a pipe cleaner and a smoker’s cap.</p>
<p>The research of my family’s history has strengthened family ties and I have been introduced to a range of people. I have learned to use various research tools and learned about the history of SA and the Burra District.</p>

<p>My wife Nicci and I moved recently from Adelaide and I have been impressed by the well equipped nature of the school and the friendly staff. I am teaching Year 12 Biology and Years 8 &amp; 9 Science and Maths. After driving 11⁄2 hours through peak hour traffic from Morphett Vale to get to work at Modbury heights last year, it is bliss to walk for 21⁄2 minutes to school from Kingston Street. Nicci and I are keen Bible students and appreciate the extra time we have to put into that part of our lives. Having lived on the sea front all my life, I miss windsurfing and water skiing, but feel they are small sacrifices for what has been gained in Burra. We are expecting our first child on 30 June.</p>
<p>Birth. To Noreen &amp; Pat Hallion, a daughter.</p>
<p>Fire.</p>
<p>[Apparently there was a sufficiently serious fire at the Kooringa Hotel in the previous week to put it out of action for some time, but the only clue to that is the comment: ‘Hope the Kooringa Hotel is repaired to functioning as soon as possible after the fire last week.’]</p>

<p>Graham Kelloock</p>
<p>Born 1942 and a fourth generation Burra resident. With my family I am involved in running Kelvale Poll Merino Stud and in farming and grazing. Among the many organisations I have been involved with are: Burra Rural Youth (President 1960-61), President Farrell Flat Football Club 1964, Member of Burra Show Society for 30 years and President for 2 years, Member of Burra Football Club and President for 2 years, Member of Burra School Council and Chairman of its Agricultural Committee for 2 years during the formation of the Agricultural Section of the school. Foundation member and President for 4 years of the Sports Club Committee, during which time the Complex was built. Joined the District Council in 1985 and have been a Councillor ever since and Deputy Chairman for the last three years. I will endeavour to promote and maintain a viable town if elected.</p>
<p>Colleen Yvonne Woodgate</p>
<p>Married to Ashley Woodgate and have five children and five grandchildren. Currently a member of the Community School Council, the Library Board, the Ambulance Board and the Boarding House Committee. I am on the Booborowie Primary School Committee and the Booborowie Soldiers’ Memorial Hall Committee, and President of the Booborowie Women’s Bowling Club. Local government is at times a frustrating and time consuming business with an increasing involvement in human services from other tiers of government. We continue to endeavour to improve the road network, clean up, contain rates and provide services. The 1990s will offer a bigger challenge, which I intend to meet head on to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Ron Shipard</p>
<p>I live at 10 Queen street and am married with two grown children, both in business in Burra. I have been associated with the district for 31 years, having farmed at Hanson and Nyngan in NSW in that time. I am now retired. I have worked with tennis clubs, Agricultural Bureaus, the Show Committee, School Council and Anglican Parish Council and have been involved in church activities. I was first elected to the Burra Burra DC in November 1989 and if re-elected will work to make Burra a cleaner and tidier place and will strive to get value for the money spent.</p>
<p>Robyn Page</p>
<p>I have been a Councillor for the past two years and have sought to maintain contact with a range of community groups through involvement with:</p>
<p>The Lewis Board of Management</p>
<p>Burra Mine Museum</p>
<p>Burra Swimming Pool Committee</p>
<p>Finance Committee</p>
<p>Planning Committee</p>
<p>I maintain an interest with the National Trust and the Community Newsletter. If elected I would pursue a number of issues:</p>
<p>Support and encourage local industry and business</p>
<p>Seek to improve services for seniors</p>
<p>Pursue effective and efficient use of plant and resources</p>
<p>Develop short and long term plans for tourism</p>
<p>Press for the sealing of the Morgan-Burra-Spalding Road</p>
<p>Revise rates and rating structure across the district.</p>
<p>With the reduction of the number of Councillors from 11 to 7 it is important that people vote.</p>
<p>Australian Orienteering Championships brought nearly 1,000 competitors and many thousands of dollars into the district. Events were staged over three days. Competitors ranged in age from 10 to 75 years and were male and female. The mammoth catering task was managed smoothly.

<p>Bronwyn Alcorn, a young visitor in Year 5 at school from Kangaroo Island was staying with her family in Paxton Square. She visited St Mary’s and developed a desire to hear its pipe organ. As a result Mum and Bronwyn got up early on Sunday for the 8 a.m. service. Sadly both organists were away so it was one of the few services without music. She took the disappointment well, but over the post service cuppa Joan Dare made a quick visit to Olive Oates’ home nearby, with the result that at 3 p.m. on Monday Bronwyn and family were treated to their own special organ recital with Olive at the console.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC. Candidate Profiles</p>
<p>James Vincent Quinn</p>
<p>Born Burra 1933. Farmer and grazier of Mt Bryan and Kings Well east of Burra. Father, Thomas and brother, Harry have both served earlier as Councillors. From 1983087 served as representative for the Mt Bryan Ward and am currently serving the whole district and am on the Finance Committee. Also on the Burra Robertstown Eudunda Pest Plant Control Board and was chairman for two years. Was a school councillor while my children were at Mt Bryan and Burra schools, being both Secretary and Chairman at Mt Bryan. Member of the Agricultural Committee at BCS for several years. Member of Hallett Bowling Club and previously active in the Mt Bryan Tennis Club and followed the BBH Football Club through the involvement of my sons. I believe Councillors have a duty to work towards the maintenance of the quality of life for all people of the district.</p>
<p>Chris Reed</p>
<p>The Council to be elected on 5 May like all Councils will find it increasingly difficult to meet electors’ needs due to reduced income from diminishing grants from Federal and State Governments and increasing costs of operation. As a Councillor for the past three years, a member of the Executive concerned with the management of many sensitive areas, Chairman of Works etc. and a member of the Tourist Association, I know I can bring valuable experience to support the Council in its next critical term. I intend to take a strong stand on the question of amalgamation of Councils to the end that Burra becomes the centre of local government for this area and to continue to support the positive direction taken by Council on tourism for the past ten years. I urge everyone to exercise their right to vote.</p>
<p>John Michael Oates</p>
<p>Aged 33 and married to Jackie. Have two children and live at Poonunda Station east of Burra as have my family for three generations. Previously a member of the Burra Pistol Club and currently a member of the Burra Tennis Club and Burra Golf Club and Vice-President and foundation member of the Burra Picnic Races Inc. I joined the District Council in 1987 and have since learnt a great deal about the running and financial areas of operation. I would like to be re-elected to participate more, having had some time to gain experience. I have served on the Works Committee and the Redbanks Management Committee. My main areas of concentration would be:</p>
<p>Continued upgrading of rural roads.</p>
<p>Upgrading and sealing of streets in our four towns.</p>
<p>Pressure the relevant departments for more funding for country hospitals.</p>
<p>To represent the whole area to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Kevin William Wallis</p>
<p>I live at 6 Queen Street. Married to Barbara and have three sons at BCS. Have resided in Burra for three years, but as a newcomer I can see the areas of need in the town:</p>
<p>Recycling the rubbish instead of burning it.</p>
<p>Tree planting in Burra and the district.</p>
<p>Sealing of the Morgan Road.</p>
<p>A tidier town.</p>
<p>Tourism – more efficient managing and new ideas.</p>
<p>To help local businesses where possible.</p>
<p>Manage rates to give more value for each dollar.</p>
<p>Residents of Burra will see their ideas and complaints get a fair hearing of more local residents are elected. The Council needs new blood. Local elections normally only have a small turn-out of voters and I urge you to vote on 5 May if you normally do not.</p>

<p>Dr R.P. Oswald writes outlining the gradual decline in the numbers of volunteers in the St John Ambulance Service. It has reached a crisis point with only eleven volunteers and this jeopardises the continuation of the service. If it fails the ambulance would have to come from Clare. Expect at least an hour’s delay and with only two ambulances to serve Clare and Burra, perhaps more. A Clare ambulance will also be more likely to transport the case to Clare, jeopardising another Burra service by bypassing the Burra Hospital.</p>

<p>Burra and Districts Apex Club</p>
<p>With regret the current members of the Burra &amp; Districts Apex Club have resolved to surrender their charter. The main reason is the expectation placed upon each member to contribute $90 (i.e. in membership fees) as requested by the Zone Board. Members consider this an excessive contribution and burden on community funds that have been raised within the community. Among other things, over the years the club has contributed to the Community Newsletter, Morphett’s Enginehouse, Hallett RSL Hall, numerous fundraising barbecues, the playgroup equipment and work at the Burra Kindergarten. The club has resolved to commit its surplus funds to the Community News, of which it has been a major sponsor since its inception. We call on the members of the community to take over this role.</p>

<p>Cheryl Day thanks all who supported her athletics trip to the USA &amp; Canada. In the Santa Monica meeting she won the 100 m and the 200 m and at Victoria on Vancouver Island she won the 400 m and came 3rd in the 100 m.</p>
<p>The main event was the British Columbis Track &amp; Field Championships. She took part in the 100 m, 200 m, 400 m and the 4 x 400 m relay. In the 100 m and 200 m she finished 6th and in the 400 m was placed 3rd. In the 4 x 400 m relay the team picked up the bronze medal. [Photo.]</p>
<p>The Burra Youth Centre will reopen on 3 August with a video night after several years of inactivity. [The Youth Group (as it was then termed) was mentioned as already existing in the Community News of 9 June 1978. In September 1978 it is reported in its new clubrooms. The last reference seems to be in June 1985.]</p>
<p>The rekindling of interest follows a survey done recently by young people and parents through the BCS and the Community Newsletter. It was organised by Year 12 School to Work to Community Students and their Community Service Teacher Dennis Morgan. The results showed:</p>
<p>Young people would support a Youth Centre.</p>
<p>The age range would be 10-19, but it would be necessary to have separate activities for juniors 10-14 and seniors 15-19 initially, with perhaps a third split later.</p>
<p>Friday and/or Saturday nights were favoured.</p>
<p>Most popular activities were discos, video nights, competitions and camps.</p>
<p>There seemed to be enough parent/adult support.</p>
<p>A Committee/Planning Group would emerge after the first couple of activities.</p>

<p>Burra Picnic Race Club: President John Maidment’s Report</p>
<p>We have been through another successful year; our fifth. Much is owed to the efficiency and keenness of the committee. Sponsorship by the traders of the town has been vital. The profit this year was $6,163. Of this $2,100 went to the Flying Doctor, $1,500 to SES and $356 to the CFS for radios. That left $2,207 which will be used on improvements to the track. We hope to hold a country style dance at the Town Hall on the long weekend in October. This will raise money to help organise the next race meeting.</p>

<p>The Mid North Regional Development Board is thanked for its contribution of $4,000 towards the cost of the brochure. Jenny O’Connor was thanked for her involvement in the Tourist Association and she and Denny were wished well in their retirement.</p>

<p>Burra Swimming Pool is in need of extensive and costly upgrading. The Pool Management Committee is liaising with the Burra Burra DC and BCS ways of seeking funding for a new pool on BCS grounds. The idea is to place it abutting the east end of the school gymnasium and so use the existing change rooms, showers and canteen. Areas under the gymnasium would provide space for the pools filters etc. The education Department will make a capital contribution towards the project. The new pool would be or rubberized cement and be fenced with cyclone mesh. It would be half Olympic size and the area would be landscaped and incorporate extra parking. It would complement other sporting facilities in the area.</p>

Other additions are the lectern and pedestals. The merino Capital of the World Night was a great success. We would not be in the financial position we are without the great help of the Ladies Auxiliary. The sheep project continues, but the rural depression has impacted on returns.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC. Election candidate profiles.</p>
<p>John William Burge</p>
<p>I have lived all but three years of my life in the Farrell Flat area, working on a farm and taking a keen interest in local affairs and serving on local committees. I have been Secretary of the Hall Committee for many years, 23 years on the Farrell Flat CFS, 20 years as Council Representative on the Clare Hospital Board and 17 years representing the Farrell Flat Ward on the Burra Burra DC, where I served on the Works Committee and Weeds Board. I am a Life Member of the Hanson-Burra Agricultural Bureau and was chairman for a number of years. I am a member of and trustee of St Mary’s Anglican Church. At present we are in challenging times with dwindling or even negative primary incomes and this will present the Council with difficult decisions. I look forward to the challenge.</p>
<p>Bob Heath</p>
<p>Aged 46 and married to Marg with a combined family of five children. We are committed Burra residents with pride in our town and lifestyle. I am a self employed commission agent with an office in Commercial Street and conducting a real estate and insurance business. I have lived in Burra for four years and have supported junior sports, school and church. I was born into a farming family at Wudinna and spent most of my working life in the rural agency field in the Lower North and Eyre Peninsula and have a deep appreciation of the needs of rural SA from farmers to housekeepers and small shopkeepers. As a Councillor I would listen to all electors and work for their interests. The development of industry is paramount in my view also.</p>
<p>Graham Malcolm Kellock</p>
<p>Born 1942 and a fourth generation Burra resident and with my family am involved in running Kelvale Poll Merino Stud. I have been involved in many district organisations, including Burra Rural Youth (President 1960-1), Farrell Flat Football Club (President 1964), Burra Football Club (President for 2 years), Member of Burra School Council and chairman of the School’s Agricultural Section, member of the Burra Bowling Club, Foundation Member and still on the Sports Club Committee, serving for 12 years and was President for four years when the complex was built. Joined the Burra Burra DC in 1985 and served on many Council Committees. Deputy Chairman for three years and currently Chairman and have represented the Burra Burra DC in a number of areas.</p>
<p>John Michael Oates</p>
<p>Aged 34 and married with two children. Third generation of a family living on a pastoral property 28 km east of Burra. Have been involved in Tennis, Golf and Pistol Clubs over the years and a committee member of the Burra Picnic Race Club. Councillor for the past four years and sat on a number of committees. If re-elected my priorities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Continuing the upgrading of rural roads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrading the streets of the four towns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting small business in the district.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helping to steer the district and community through the present tough times with minimal cost.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>James Vincent Quinn</p>
<p>58 years old and a Mt Bryan Farmer married to Rosemary. Standing for re-election. Currently on the Works Committee and chairman of the Finance Committee. If re-elected it will be my 5th term. I believe I have acquired the experience needed to help us through the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>Chris Reed</p>
<p>Have been a Councillor for the past four years. I have achieved most of the elector requests made of me and intend to continue doing so, ensuring that Burra &amp; Districts survive the hard times and making the hard ecisions needed to maintain services and guarantee Burra’s survival.</p>
<p>Ronald John Shipard</p>
<p>Married with a family of two – both of whom are in business in Burra. As a family we are committed to the survival of Burra. I have been associated with the district for 32 years, having farmed at Hanson and at Nyngan in NSW in that time. Now retired. Worked with various committees, including the Tennis Club, Agricultural Bureau, Show Society, School Council, the Anglican Parish Council and other church activities; first elected to Council in November 1989 and re-elected in 1990. Am committed to keeping a strong DC in place.</p>
<p>Kevin William Wallis</p>
<p>Resident of Burra for the past five years. Married to Barbara and have three boys. Currently mining east of Burra and am setting up a tourist attraction to help bring tourists to Burra. My main concern is that, with the current Council being mainly rural people, when rates are increased the town people are the ones who get the increase. If elected I would like to see:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Market Square altered so it is not under constant road repair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Morgan Road bituminised or at the least upgraded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tourist attractions in Burra remaining as a community project and not as private enterprise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cleaning up of rubbish around the town of Burra and along the creek.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The upgrading of the heavy vehicles bypass road.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Colleen Y. Woodgate</p>
<p>Wife, mother, grandmother and community member and Councillor for four years. Chairman of Planning and member of the Finance Committees. On the heritage Advisory Committee, Chairman of the Burra Community Activities Centre, Member of the Hospital Board, the Library Board, Local government proxy to the Lower North Regional Health Association, President of the Booborowie Women’s Bowling Club, member of the Booborowie Hall Committee and the Booborowie School Council. I will undertake to continue as I have in the past, bringing your needs to the attention of Council and attended to when possible.</p>
<p>Barry Wright</p>
<p>I am 49 and married to Maureen and have been a resident of Burra for eight years at 1 Young Street. In pre-Burra days I travelled extensively as a professional wool-classer in SA, NSW, Victoria and WA, often managing shearing teams for a contractor. I worked a small alluvial gold mine in the far north of SA and worked as a station hand for two years. I have jointly produced and published a very successful book on navigational charts of the River Murray and through this have had dealings with various tourist areas. I have an understanding of the problems and benefits of tourism. Since coming to Burra in April 1983, when I purchased a wool buying business, Maureen and I have renovated the old Sara’s building and established the business of Sara’s Secondhand Goods and Chattels in Burra North. I have been actively involved in the Burra National Trust, served on the Copper Festival Committee and am Chairman of the Town Hall Committee and am also an active member of the Burra Traders’ Association. In 1987 we purchased Tiver’s Row of cottages in Truro Street, which I am currently renovating. Through the National Trust I have been actively involved in heritage and planning decisions. I believe the above experiences will be of value to the town and district if I am elected to Council.</p>
<p>BCS. The State Secondary Schools Athletics Championships were held last Thursday at Kensington.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Hospital Board recently resolved to accept a draft constitution to incorporate the hospital under the SA Health Commission Act. It is proposed to hold a public meeting in March to recommend that the Hospital accept this constitution and become incorporated under the SA Health Commission Act. The majority of hospitals in SA are incorporated under this act. The benefits of the move are seen to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Standardisation of operational guidelines and procedures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved legal representation by the SA Health Commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved portability for staff for long service and sick leave entitlements etc. and the hospital will thus be better able to attract staff from other incorporated hospitals and Government Departments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved communications with the Commission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No loss of ownership of the Hospital by the Board. It will remain under the ownership and control of the Community through an elected Board of Directors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better working relationship with the SA Health Commission.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Points against:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once so incorporated the situation cannot be reversed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Central Bureaucracy gains more power over the Hospital and can more easily direct what services the Hospital can or cannot provide – but it already has this power to direct services in all Public Hospitals through the budget process.</p>

<p>President Paul Wilson’s Annual Report 1992</p>
<p>The main event of the year was the demolition of the complex by fire early in the football and netball season 1991. D.T. Jacka &amp; Co. undertook the demolition and rebuilding using the majority of local sub-contractors. By December 1991 the building was better than ever with new carpets, a new bar system, tables, chairs and a verandah along the back, with future plans for extensions and improvements. The kitchen has been improved with a much larger and more efficient working space. Further improvements await only a reply from a grant application. The efforts of the Club and its committee were recognised by receiving the Australia Day Award for Community Event of the Year. Cr Graham Kellock must be acknowledged for his tremendous work in liaising with the insurance company and the architect. The Ladies’ Auxiliary deserves many thanks as well. Richard Secomb raised money with our sheep project and Don Stockman cropped the Hanson Reserve on share and raised $400 for the club.</p>

<p>Adelaide Chemical Company has expansion plans for 1992.</p>
<p>The largest expansion for 20 years is underway. More than $3 million will be spent in 1992 as a part of an $8 million expansion over the next three years. This will expand the range of products and the range of possible raw materials as raw feed. Burra is the largest cupric oxide plant in the world. It supplies more than 25% of the world’s needs for use as an ingredient in timber preservation, as a catalyst for some chemical manufacture, ferrites in the electronics industry, in tyres and in ceramics.</p>
<p>Over 90% of the production is exported and it brings over $20 million into Australia as export revenue annually. To remain competitive and expand AdChem needed to treat alternative feed materials. The retrofit of the multiple hearth roaster was chosen as the best way to do this. It was originally built in 1972 to roast ore dry from the Burra Mine. It converted malachite and azurite into impure copper metal. This then became the feed material for the cupric oxide process still used today. When the Burra ore was exhausted the roaster stopped in 1982. AdChem then converted to treating copper cement and scrap.</p>
<p>It was known that there was a great opportunity to treat copper sulphide concentrates. Adelaide and Wallaroo Fertilisers tested the process in the mid 1980s, but diverted their attention elsewhere before it was successful. In 1990 CSIRO performed an extensive test program and a short full-scale trial followed on the Burra roaster in September 1990. Results were encouraging and there were further tests at a pilot plant in Belgium. These results were used to design the roaster retrofit.</p>
<p>The multiple hearth roaster at ACC is among the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. It stands 26.3 m high and is 7.8 m in diameter. Feed material enters at the top and slowly works its way through 12 hearths to leave at the bottom. Air and natural gas go the other way.</p>
<p>The copper sulphide concentrate is heated to over 800°C and mixed with air. The minerals roast to form sulphur dioxide gas and low grade copper oxide. The sulphur dioxide is scrubbed and the solids are temporarily stored. They are later given a second pass through the furnace. The copper oxide reacts with natural gas to form Carbon dioxide and impure copper metal. This product is similar to that produced from Burra ore in the 1970s. It is leached in ammonium carbonate solution in the same way to produce cupric oxide.</p>
<p>ACC works closely with the SA Department of Environment and Planning and the scrubber system to remove sulphur dioxide is designed to be four times better than specified levels. Well over $1 million has been spent on this piece of equipment. It converts the sulphur dioxide to sodium sulphite. Construction will begin next month on a plant to crystallise sodium sulphite for sale to paper manufacturers.</p>
<p>In mid-March ACC began trials using copper sulphite concentrate from a mine at Moonta. After three short runs the plant ran for six continuous days in mid-April. This confirmed that the plant could produce a good product and that the sulphur dioxide scrubbing was very effective.</p>
<p>The roaster will be shut down till the end of June while the filter is being built. ACC will then have an exceptionally clean roaster by world standards.</p>
<p>The new work has increased traffic and noise and ACC will construct a road from Copperhouse Street directly into the plant so that heavy vehicles do not have to enter the town. Other noise reduction work is underway. Employees are being given more chance for personal development than ever before.</p>
<p>[A personal development program is then outlined.]</p>
<p>Eight new people joined ACC in the past six months and eight more permanent positions will be created in the next six months. More than 55 people will then work at the Burra Plant.</p>

She has also helped considerably in fundraising, time-keeping and scoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jenny Hirschausen began as a junior player and moved through the grades to A Grade, where she did most of her playing. She has been very active in coaching at all levels, especially in junior grades. She has been coaching since 1985. She has been interested in umpiring and has been actively involved most weeks for many years. She has been President, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary and in 1989 was Secretary-Treasurer of the Association. And has also been Club Reporter and Association Delegate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robyn Baker came to the Burra Club in 1974 and has been involved ever since. She played for several seasons and in 1984 was involved (with Hazel Stockman) in organising the married ladies’ team and playing in it – a venture that only lasted one year. She has been actively engaged in coaching all grades from J3 to B1 over the years. She has been an umpire for many years at all levels and is still umpiring. She has been President, Secretary, Treasurer, Association Delegate and a committee member.</p>

<p>BCS Student Boarding</p>
<p>The School Council has formed a sub-committee to be known as the Burra Community School Boarding Facility Committee to establish a student hostel facility in the building formerly used at the Burra Hospital as nurses’ accommodation. The Hospital Board has agreed to allow this use. The Burra Burra DC will be asked to submit an application to DEET for funding to refurbish the building and we believe Council will give support to this scheme. The Hospital Board, School Council and members of the District Council recognise the need for such a facility, without which there will be no student boarding facility for families in remote and isolated areas to the north and east. The hospital will assist with meals and laundry service. The committee will also be seeking community support and the Isolated Children &amp; Parents’ Organisation (ICPA) has agreed to donate $1,000. The school will benefit by increasing student numbers, which brings in more staff and creates the chance for more curriculum choice. It will make use of an otherwise unused facility and will make further links between Burra and the remote pastoral community.</p>

<p>Kevin W. Wallis</p>
<p>Resident of Burra for seven years. Married to Barbara and have three sons, Lee, Adam and Brett. Since moving here I have been self employed in the mining industry and am an active member of the Burra Community. I spent two years on the committee of the Burra Mine Museum and am an active member of the Burra Pistol Club. My interests in being on Council include the establishment of a waste management scheme and implementation of a recycling depot. I am committed to the development of Burra as a safe and attractive place to raise children and the promotion of varied employment opportunities for its occupants. I am well aware of the historical and heritage importance of Burra to SA and the need to proceed with tourism and development with informed debate.</p>

<p>With my wife I have lived in Burra for ten years and own and run Sara’s in Burra North. I am experienced in business, tourism, book publishing and rural affairs and am on committees of the Lewis Board, Mine Management, Burra Tourist Association, Mid North Development Board and the National Trust; all of which are great experience in dealing with Government Departments etc. I would greatly like to serve Burra as a Councillor and solicit your number 1 vote on Saturday 1 May.</p>
<p>Chris Reed</p>
<p>I have been a Councillor for seven years and have concentrated on developing the tourist industry of Burra and District through Council initiatives – including the Burra Tourist Association. My years have given me first hand experience in dealing with the many problems facing Local Government – especially rates, roads and rubbish. I believe my background in Council, in a family rural enterprise and briefly in a town business gives me the skills to continue to develop the town and community for the good of all electors.</p>

<p>The Yard Dog and Dog Jumping Competitions drew good audiences, as did the Wood Chopping, Roustabout, Sheep Counting and Three Way Drafting Competitions. Other new attractions included Santa Gertrudis cattle, alpacas, a working blacksmith, blade shearing and a display of native animals. There were a number of sections designed to appeal to the children and many were enthralled by the puppet theatre or attracted to face painting. Miss Show Girl proved a crowd pleaser:</p>

<p>Father John Devenport was born in England and educated at various schools in northwest Kent. After a two-year stint in the RAF he came to Australia and was employed with the Research &amp; Development Branch of the Department of Mines (later to become AMDEL). At this time he began a degree course in Chemical Technology. His wife Barbara was also born in England and received most of her education there before coming to Adelaide. The couple were married at St Margaret’s Church, Woodville and have two children. Paul, the elder, is married with a small son. He is frequently heard on ABC Radio. Catherine is also married with two sons. While John was studying his Chemistry course, Barbara took a two year course in Theology and was awarded the TH.A. with first class honours.</p>
<p>John then took up a lecturing post with the SA Institute of Technology at Port Pirie and Barbara took over the Mail Bag Sunday School. Both took an active interest in Missions to Seamen, YAF and other parish matters. John undertook studies in Theology and became a lay reader, church warden, synodsman and synod seal holder. When the Institute of Technology closed in Port Pirie the Devenports went to Adelaide. John then went to Britain where he gained a B. Phil. degree in 1977 and an M. Sc. in 1978. Barbara meanwhile took a course in accountancy and later studied taxation. In 1987 John became a deacon and studied at St Barnabas College and St Francis Xavier Seminary and after ordination to the priesthood he became assistant priest at Christ Church North Adelaide. He was subsequently locum tenens at Murray Bridge, Jamestown and Burra.</p>

<p>BCS. As the Burra School &amp; Community News ends with the issue of 22 December 1993, the school will need a new channel of communication with parents and community. It has been proposed there be a fortnightly publication to inform about school events and provide an outlet for writing from students, staff and parents and for students’ art work. The publication will need a name and also volunteers and a cartoon-type character to appear regularly.</p>
<p>22 December 1993</p>
<p>Chris McCabe, the first BCS Principal, writes to say that he remembers reading that ‘a town without a newspaper is a town without a soul’. Ian Auhl said much the same thing in 1976 just before the Burra Record ceased publication in the following year. He says that the fact that the newsletter survived until December 1993 showed it served a need. He writes of fond memories of the volunteers and was pleased once to have been a member of their team. He wishes the Burra Broadcaster a long and successful future.</p>
<p>Kevin Fahey, Principal of BCS writes that he has been proud to have been associated with the Burra School &amp; Community News and praises the dedication of the editors, typists, proofreaders, contributors, payout people, collators and distributors. He thanks all community members who have contributed to its success over the past sixteen years. He says a new avenue of communication will be developed and one such is the School’s Radio Station, which was granted a ‘narrow class licence’ the previous week.</p>
<p>Mary Woollacott writes reflecting on the sixteen years of operation:</p>
<p>The ‘School’ and later ‘School &amp; Community News’ was born from a perceived need to keep a local news identity.</p>
<p>Chris McCabe was the prime mover in its establishment.</p>
<p>The first issues were produced from typed stencils.</p>
<p>The last issue used computer type setting.</p>
<p>It has depended on co-operation in every facet of its production.</p>
<p>For her ‘Hear and There’ was a column that stemmed from her days of writing ‘Out and About’ for the Burra Record.</p>
<p>While the publication was never in direct competition with the Broadcaster the decreasing number of volunteers meant that the committee had to accept the inevitable rather than place too great a burden on too few people.</p>
<p>Cameron Grover writes regretting that this was the last issue of Burra School &amp; Community News and points to its importance as a means of preserving a historical record of the town and surrounding districts during a period that a newspaper was not being published – as well as a means of communicating school news and sports results. He thanks all associated with its success and production on behalf of the School and Community News Committee.</p>
<p>Chris Reed as Chairman of the Burra Community School Council adds his thanks and acknowledgement of the efforts of the group that produced the paper for the past sixteen years, echoing what has already been said and adding thanks especially to the major donors over the years: the Burra Apex Club, Burra traders, The Burra Burra District Council and the Burra Community School.</p>
<p>Ken, Roslyn, Sally &amp; Russell Horne now of ‘Ben Lomond’ via Kapunda and formerly of Koomooloo Station thank all who supported them in their time of need and in their removal to their new home.</p>
<p>Reminders:</p>
<p>Swimming in the Burra Creek is not permitted for health and safety reasons.</p>
<p>Redbanks, including its waterhole, remains closed to the public.</p>
