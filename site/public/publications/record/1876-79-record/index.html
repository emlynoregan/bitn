<p>A Note from the Publishers expresses apologies for a smaller size of the paper than was intended. They considered deferring the first issue due to difficulties experienced, but decided to publish a slightly smaller issue. [It was five columns wide instead of six.]</p>
<p>Editorial. Inaugural</p>
<p>It has often been a matter of surprise that a local paper has never been started in Burra. In the palmy days of the Mine from 1846 to 1852 the population was large and thriving, but of a different class from that now included in the district. At the time there were no provincial papers in SA and not more than three papers in Adelaide. But times have changed greatly and several important towns in the colony have had one or even two newspapers for years. It is difficult to explain why Burra has lagged behind ‘but even if there has hitherto been any serious impediment to the starting of a local paper, we venture to think that the important changes which, during the past three years, have taken place in the district, have removed any such impediment, and that the time has arrived for establishing a journalistic organ of our own.’</p>
<p>We think that a town with its own Council ought to support a newspaper. Indeed a respectably conducted newspaper ought to add as much to the status of a town as a Council does. Our intention is not to trumpet Burra’s fame to the world. In fact the most brilliant period of Burra’s history is a thing of the past, but there are today indications of steady improvement, giving hopes of a brighter future than seemed possible a few years ago.</p>
<p>The prospects of the Mine again proving very profitable are encouraging, but Burra is no longer entirely dependent on the Mine for its prosperity. Important as the Mine is, the extension of agricultural settlement in the surrounding districts is a great source of prosperity. Burra is the focus of a great are of wheat and wool growing country to the north, west and east. These lands are becoming more densely settled every year and Burra’s importance as the central town of such a large district will become greater.</p>
<p>With a greater population the need for a local paper increases. Local wants require more persistent advocacy than we can expect to get from the impartial journals of the metropolis. Local grievances need airing and local resources and institutions need to be kept before the public. We hope that local tradesmen and manufacturers will see the advantage of advertising their businesses.</p>
<p>In politics we will be liberal, always taking the side of progress, seeking to promote the prosperity of the Colony in general and of the Burra District in particular. While exposing abuses we will seek to avoid scurrility. Our columns will be open for the free exchange of views on matters of public interest. We shall be glad to receive concise well-written letters of news from the Northern Areas and also such other literary assistance as our friends may be able and willing to supply. We trust that in a few months our paper will come to be regarded as a necessity.</p>
<p>SA Government Policy</p>
<p>[There is an article of just over one column reflecting on the policies of the Boucaut Government. Boucaut had made much of stamp duties, but had been frustrated by the Upper House. The Boucaut ministry fell on the 6 June and the writer considered the new Colton Government was an incongruous mixture of ministers. Colton had announced extensions of railways and improvements to harbours and jetties. Other matters were a water supply for Yorke Peninsula and improvements to the Real Property Act, land laws and mining laws. Tariffs would be changes in the direction of free trade. The most important new railways were to be to Government Gums 212 miles north of Pt Augusta, to open up new mineral areas and extend settlement. The other line of importance was from Kapunda to Morgan to tap the river trade. Other railways planned were to connect Pt Pirie, Gladstone and Jamestown and to connect the mining centres of Yorke Peninsula to the city via Barunga Gap and Hamley Bridge. The extension of the Burra line to Hallett and eventually to the Barrier Ranges area in NSW was of greater concern to Burra. The writer hoped the new Government would get on with its program and saw great hopes for the future in the growth of settlement and trade.]</p>
<p>Burra Philharmonic Society</p>
<p>A committee meeting was held in the Burra Institute on 29 June to form a Philharmonic Society. A meeting for people wishing to become members is called for 7 July at 7.30 p.m. at the Institute.</p>
<p>Rhe Buckley &amp; La Feuillade Anglo-American Co. performed at the Institute on Friday 23 June. There was only moderate attendance due to insufficient notice. It was an evening of songs, comic songs and music in part one. After the interval songs, dances, comic sketches and musical items were presented. On Saturday night there was a change of program, which was also gone through with spirit and was loudly applauded by the small audience.</p>

<p>I, 1, 30 June 1876, page 3</p>
<p>‘An Inhabitant’ writes commenting on how gratifying it was on Sunday to hear from St Mary’s a call for cleanliness in body, mind and soul. As far as cleanliness of body is concerned a number of things militate against it. A well ventilated dwelling and purity of atmosphere are to be desired. But where there are foul smells, foul drains cloacæ of the vilest and most disgusting class, the ground strewn with offal and the most excrementitious filth, then typhoid and scarlet fever will abound and have not been absent from the town for the past two years. As many as ten contemporaneous cases of typhoid have attracted the attention of the Board of Health. The cemetery can bear silent witness to the continuous influx of children who might otherwise have become healthy and useful adults. The system of allotments cut up by speculators into insignificant fragments to be sold or rented at a high price without any care and proper accommodation of the labouring population is an arrangement, which in comparatively warm climates, such as our own, constitutes a perfect nursery for epidemic and contagious diseases.</p>
<p>The preacher [Rev. H. Howitt] condemned the overcrowding which prevails in the wretched dwelling houses that are so supinely tolerated in the town. There is, he said, an apparent want of energy on the part of various official persons, to whom he had made urgent and repeated addresses in vain, for some prompt action to prevent the spread of demoralising tendencies and malaria.</p>
<p>It was this lack of action that had prompted his use of the pulpit.</p>
<p>‘Estrom’ writes saying that the recent debate in the SA Parliament on railway gauges saw only one speaker argue forcibly against the current support for the narrow gauge. There is, he says, a remarkable similarity in the arguments of Mr Rees in Parliament and those put forward in the local Parliamentary Club debate on the issue, indeed access to the local debates seems evident from a perusal of the reports of the SA Parliament.</p>
<p>I, 1, 30 June 1876, pages 3 &amp; 4</p>
<p>The Burra Parliamentary Club</p>
<p>At a meeting of the members of the Burra Institute on 13 March 1876, convened by Mr W.H. Rosman, it was resolved that a club be formed to be called the Burra Parliamentary Club. Its object would be the discussion in a proper Parliamentary form of the leading topics of the day.</p>
<p>The formation of the first Ministry was entrusted to Mr J.D. Cave and resulted as follows:</p>
<p>Premier and Attorney General J.D. Cave</p>
<p>Chief Secretary W.H. Rosman</p>
<p>Commissioner of Crown Lands J.R. Stephens</p>
<p>Treasurer T. Drew</p>
<p>Commissioner of Public Works H. Dawson</p>
<p>Minister of Education H.A. Holthouse</p>
<p>Acting Governor G.W. Goodhardt</p>
<p>Speaker W.R. Ridgway</p>
<p>Clerk T. Rosman</p>
<p>Sergeant-at-Arms H. Mosarr</p>
<p>Messenger W. Dyer</p>
<p>[The article then follows the progress of the club at some length.]</p>
<p>The Acting Governor opened Parliament on 17 March and on 23 March the Premier introduced his policies. He proposed narrow gauge railways from Pt Augusta north, and Gladstone to Jamestown and broad gauge extensions from Burra to Terowie and Kapunda to Morgan. Contractors would be encouraged to import their own labour. He proposed an income and property tax.</p>
<p>F.W. Holder became Leader of the Opposition, which included E. Lipsett, J. Drew, W. West, R. Sanders and P. Lane.</p>
<p>There was apparently a change of government because the article continues with a report of the Government headed by F. Holder presenting its policy on 23 May.</p>
<p>Premier &amp; Chief Secretary F.W. Holder</p>
<p>Attorney General [P.] Lane</p>
<p>Treasurer [R.] Sanders</p>
<p>Commissioner of Crown Lands [J?] Paull</p>
<p>Commissioner of Public Works Mr Miller</p>
<p>Minister of Education E. Lipsett</p>
<p>The proposals included better representation for the expanding areas of the Colony and the retirement of a third of the Legislative Council at each general election. Railway proposals were similar in extent, but at broad gauge except for the Gladstone line. A major proposal was for the construction of a new Outer Harbour for Adelaide. This program would require a large loan and increased taxation, but the influx of population the works stimulated would ease the repayment burden. He outlined the new tax proposals and some reform of Land Laws.</p>
<p>I, 1, 30 June 1876, page 4</p>
<p>Burra Mine.</p>
<p>Captain Sanders’ report 12 June.</p>
<p>In the past four weeks heavy rain has restricted surface work to three weeks, but underground work has continued apace. Morphett’s Shaft advanced 7 ft. The lode underlaying east has nearly gone out of the shaft and will be lost in another 6 ft. The 70 crosscut east proceeds. 70 driving north has crossed the lode about 12 ft wide in low values and very wet. 60 crosscut east has been dammed and 60 north has been cleaned of sand and we are driving north to Peacock’s air shaft to bring the water to that shaft for pumping. Peacock’s Air Shaft is approaching the 50. The crosscut at 50 has been holed to Grave’s Engine Shaft, which is important work for the future of the mine below that level. The mine is now thoroughly ventilated for about 400 fathoms in length, greatly improving air quality throughout. 50 fathom level has been cleared and secured from Peacock’s and holed to Roach’s Shaft. This shaft is standing firm to 50, but full of stuff below. The intention is to clear it to 60 and then ventilate the 60 fathom level. Have cleared a branch level at 50, some 5 fathoms and holed to Ayer’s Shaft. Ayer’s Shaft is firm, but full of stuff. It is clear from the surface for a considerable distance and we will try to run it through. The ground around this shaft should be suitable for some tributer’s pitches. Clearing Roach’s and Ayer’s Shafts will ventilate the mine and enable working below the great excavation. The northern end of the mine will be able to be worked by pumping water out through Grave’s Shaft. Bunce’s Shaft has reached 18 fathoms and in a month we shall start crosscuts east and west under the old deposits of ore. The new incline tunnel would have been completed, but the farmers have been seeding and have not had time to deliver cap-piece timber. When this arrived it will take about three weeks to complete.</p>
<p>Notice. District Council of Burra gives notice of the Annual Ratepayers’ Meeting 3 July 10 a.m. for the purpose of nominating or electing two Councillors to replace the retiring Cr J. Killicoat and R. Stevens and two auditors for the district. For Redruth Ward the meeting to be at the Racecourse Hotel, Copperhouse and for South Ward at the Sod Hut Hotel. If more nominations are received than are required polls will be held at the same places on 10 July. Ratepayers in Kooringa Ward can vote for auditors only in either of the above places.</p>

<p>Editorial on the Government’s Parliamentary activity in the past week, especially concerning the Railway Bills: North-West bend [Morgan] Bill passed its second reading and the Jamestown &amp; Gladstone Bill passed.

<p>Burra Hospital. It would scarcely seem necessary to explain the advantages of having a hospital, but there are always those who cavil at any proposal. We grant that a building already exists, which is known as the hospital and which provides beds and medical attendance. [A rather wordy article suggests that proposed improvements are well justified and implies that some have suggested home nursing was adequate, because the article goes on to explain why this is not so.]</p>
<p>A person’s home often lacks the skilful nursing that is required by the victim of an accident, or those suffering a lingering disease. ‘This is largely excepted to, but that a sick nurse requires special training is now accepted in England as a self-evident truth.’ Even that rare bird, the born nurse, would be none the worse for proper training. Invalid cookery is an art in itself. Private homes also often lack necessary space and good ventilation. There is in Burra a need for a properly furnished hospital.</p>
<p>[The existing building was the Mine Hospital located between the Mine entrance and Opie’s Hotel on Market Street and generally known as Bleak House.]</p>
<p>Banks. An article discusses the recent failure of several Colonial banks, especially in Victoria, and the fraudulent behaviour of bank officers.</p>
<p>Fire. One of Mr Lipsett’s children overturned a candle and set fire to bed curtains and other bedroom furnishings. Mr Lipsett came in just in the nick of time and was able to extinguish the flames and so save the house. Damage is estimated at about £15.</p>
<p>Kooringa Masonic Lodge held a meeting on Monday 3 July. W. Watts of Kooringa and E.C. Davies of Buttamuc [sic] were initiated by PM Alex. Stewart. Visitors included Mr G. Sanders of the American Constitution, recently arrived from the USA. He is the eldest son of Captain R. Sanders of the Burra Mines. [W. Watts was probably the William Watts elected for North Ward in the District Council in 1878 and perhaps the same W. Watts who sold his butchering business in Thames St to Mr Ohlmeyer – see advertisement 22 February 1878. Buttamuck was a run northwest of Peterborough, established in 1868.]</p>
<p>Obituary. A man from Gum Creek was brought into the hospital suffering from pleuro-pneumonia and he died on Monday night a little after 12. [He appears to have been registered as John Harper aged 66 who died 4 July at Aberdeen, ‘of no fixed abode the bush.’]</p>
<p>Burra Hospital. We have had left at our office drawings showing the proposed alterations and additions to the Burra Hospital. We understand the contract was signed on Wednesday 5 July 1876, with work to be completed in six months. The architect is William Beattie of Port Adelaide and the contractors are Messrs G. &amp; W. Sara. When completed it should be a great improvement on the present building.</p>
<p>[This refers to proposed additions to Bleak House, the old Mine Hospital. This work did not eventuate: see later references to the Burra Hospital.]</p>

<p>The International Cable. The cable repairing ship Edinburgh has picked up the end of broken cable 22 miles from Port Darwin on Tuesday, but could not speak to Banjoewangie, so it is feared there is another break further on.</p>
<p>Booborowie District Council Elections</p>
<p>At a meeting at Booborowie on Monday:</p>
<p>Mr Robert Giles was re-elected.</p>
<p>Mr Charles Holder was re-elected.</p>
<p>Mr Robert McEllister and Mr Alfred Coon were nominated and received an equal show of hands.</p>
<p>The Chairman gave his casting vote for McEllister who was declared elected.</p>
<p>W. Thomas and Philip Taylor were elected as auditors.</p>
<p>Redruth Court</p>
<p>Ebenezer Robert Dangers was charged on the information of Joseph Jackson with the theft on Sunday of a purse, three pound notes and other small items at Mr Williams’ Boarding House Redruth. [This was a somewhat confused case because all the men involved were drunk at the time of the alleged offence.]</p>
<p>Dangers had gone to the Police Station on Sunday at about noon to report he had been robbed by Charles Odgers of £3 while at the White Hart Hotel that morning. Dangers was made to turn out his pockets and the P-C Francis Bennett found a purse and other items Dangers said were his property.</p>
<p>On the way to the White Hart Dangers said the £3 was Jackson’s and Jackson identified the purse. Dangers was found to have some notes hidden in his sock.</p>
<p>When examined Jackson admitted he had been drinking Sunday morning and might have given Dangers the money.</p>
<p>Charles Odgers was examined and denied taking the money, but said Dangers had offered to fight him for £1 and had gone to Jackson’s room and come out with some notes in the purse. Dangers had then said that he was flush with money, let’s go and shout.</p>
<p>Dangers said they did not fight, but being in liquor, he afterwards forgot where he had put the money and thought Odgers had stolen it.</p>
<p>The bench dismissed the case.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council, 3 July</p>
<p>The new Council was sworn in at the District Council Room adjoining the Institute. Only a few members of the public showed enough interest to attend. Sworn in were:</p>
<p>For North Ward: Messrs [August] Bartholomæus and G. [George] Sara</p>
<p>For Middle Ward: Messrs R. [Robert] Sanders and E. [Edward] Lipsett</p>
<p>For South Ward: Messrs J. [Joseph] Roberts and J. [John] Snell</p>
<p>It was resolved that the Council would meet every Monday fortnight in a room of the Burra Institute.</p>
<p>Advertisements would be placed for a Clerk &amp; Surveyor and Inspector of Weights &amp; Measures.</p>
<p>[As separate or joint positions.]</p>
<p>The Mayor [Mr Philip Lane] was authorised to obtain stationery, books and an iron safe.</p>
<p>Burra District Council, 4 July</p>
<p>John Humphries was elected as Councillor for Redruth Ward and Robert Stevens as Councillor for South Ward.</p>
<p>‘Nemo’ writes about the Burra District Council Election.</p>
<p>He says the election of Councillors and auditors last Monday must be invalid. Notice for nominations was given only four days before and under the District Councils Act No. 10 1858, ten days’ notice is required. Furthermore notice is required to be placed in the SA Government Gazette and by posting hand written or printed bills on every post office and pound in the district. Notices had only been placed at the Kooringa Post Office. The remedy under clause 24 was to hold another meeting and under clause 33 if this were not done within 14 days, a JP may give public notice of and call such a meeting.</p>
<p>[Nemo then goes on to elaborate on the complications caused by the declaration of the Burra Town Council and the consequent changes (yet to be gazetted) to the District Council of Burra.]</p>
<p>F.W. Holder writes clarifying his views on railway gauges as espoused in the Burra Parliamentary Club. 3’6” was only suited to short lines and light traffic and therefore was not suitable for the transcontinental line then pushing its way north from Pt Augusta towards Darwin.</p>
<p>W. West, Accountant etc. for SAMA, writes concerning sanitary conditions in Kooringa.</p>
<p>Nothing, he says, is easier than for a minister to denounce from the pulpit, but the amount of good it tends to effect is very questionable. The reve rend gentleman might have informed those in the congregation that recently the company presented the Church of England with an acre of land for the purpose of erecting a new church. As one of the officials alluded to he says he could say he had never been addressed by the reverend gentleman mentioned. Never before was Kooringa in a more cleanly condition than at present.</p>
<p>If ‘Inhabitant’ turned out to be a medical man residing not a hundred miles away from Mt Pleasant, West would thank him to be f rank and open enough to sign the name his fat her or mother bestowed on him.</p>
<p>I, 1 (2), 7 July 1876, pages 3 &amp; 4 [The number of the issue is hand corrected to 2 on the microfilm.]</p>
<p>Robert Sanders of the Burra Mine also writes on the same topic.</p>
<p>The statements made by your correspondent are quite uncalled for and as the representative of SAMA and as manager of their property in this neighbourhood I emphatically deny the statements in your correspondent’s letter.</p>
<p>The Reverend preacher has never made application to me or to any official of the company, on the subject of sanitation. Neither has anyone in authority found fault. I challenge anyone to show anywhere in SA where an equal number of working men and their families have so much room for each individual and where the sanitary condition of a township is superior to that of Kooringa. On a previous occasion Paxton Square was denounced as a hotbed of sickness. Bur here there are 33 houses, containing 91 rooms varying from 17 ft by 15 ft to 14 ft square and 10 ft high under the ceiling, in which reside 161 adults and children. The place has been pronounced by everyone else the most healthy, most roomy and best ventilated houses and there has been less sickness and death in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in any other part of the neighbourhood. The company’s houses compare favourably with workmen’s houses belonging to other people in the neighbourhood or to any other place in the colony.</p>
<p>As for the system of allotments allegedly cut up by speculative owners: has not a company an equal right to charge a fair value on their property and choose, or refuse to sell or lease, as any private individual has? The township is not in fact cut into insignificant fragments. Each house built by the company has a greater piece of land than the houses in the Government Township of Redruth, or in Aberdeen. Anyone can have 1, 2, 3 or 4 allotments if he wishes to purchase them.</p>
<p>The company is far from illiberal. It has given land to every section of the Christian church, sufficient to build a place of worship and a minister’s residence. Also it has given a cemetery, a slaughterhouse site, an acre for an Institute, land and buildings for use of a hospital (valued at £650) and has just given an acre to the Church of England for a place of worship, which at prevailing prices is worth £525. Also it has given land for a main road towards Baldina and is about to give land for a public school and playground for 1,000 pupils. These facts speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I am sorry anyone should so far forget themselves as to denounce a company which has done so much and is still doing so much good for the community.</p>
<p>Our pay sheet is at present about £28,000 per annum, the greater part of which is spent in these townships.</p>

<p>Editorial on Railways</p>
<p>[The editor says that in glancing over the Parliamentary debates, it seems it has been decided that all new lines are to be 3’ 6”, as they are less costly to construct. Lines hitherto had been 5’3”.]</p>
<p>We wonder why the 4’8” [sic: for 4’81⁄2”] was not adopted at the outset, when it was common in the UK. With some 400 miles of track contemplated it is an important consideration, especially as the Pt Augusta line is seen as the first instalment of a transcontinental line to Pt Darwin.</p>
<p>The savings in a 3’6” line must be considerable. The savings in sleepers alone is significant. Some say that the 3’6” gauge is not cheapest in the long run. But we think this decision is wise. Even if the 3’6” lines are limited to 20-25 m.p.h. it will be a great improvement on the speed of wagons or drays. A line built cheaply at say £2,500 per mile to operate at 20 m.p.h. might serve for five years. In our circumstance (where it is important to open up large areas of new country quickly, at minimal cost) this is better than a line costing £5,000 per mile to operate at 40 m.p.h. with a life of 10 years. An instance of this is the Kadina, Wallaroo and Moonta lines, which we believe were constructed at a cost of less than £2,400 per mile and are satisfactorily carrying heavy loads at 20 m.p.h. We believe there will be no great delays in starting the Pt Augusta and North West Bend [Morgan] lines and that these lines will herald the commencement of a new and prosperous era for SA.</p>
<p>Weather. Useful rain fell this week with 47 points in three days.</p>

<p>The Burra Institute held its half-yearly meeting of subscribers.</p>
<p>The income for the period was £141-11-1 and the expenditure £125-8-10.</p>
<p>The building expenditure had caused them to have a bank overdraft of £343-17-7.</p>
<p>A sum of £210 was to come at once from the Government towards this sum, but work in hand was yet to be paid for. Subscriptions will be sought to meet the debt.</p>

<p>Burra Mine</p>
<p>Captain Sanders report on 8 July.</p>
<p>Morphett’s Shaft is down nearly 13 fathoms below the 70 and by the end of September we hope to reach 85 fathoms. At that level crosscuts will be made to the east and west lodes.</p>
<p>In driving east towards Tinline’s Lode the ground is now easier.</p>
<p>Driving north at the 70 we are nearing Waterhouse’s Shaft in a promising lode.</p>
<p>The crosscut running west at the 60towards Peacock’s Air Shaft is in hard rock with bad air and air pipes are being put in.</p>
<p>Sulphurets are taking the place of carbonates at depth.</p>
<p>The clearing of Roach’s Shaft below the 60 continues, but because we have to haul water, mud and stuff 80 fathoms with a windlass and wheel, to Peacock’s, we are not making the progress we could wish.</p>
<p>Ayer’s is being cleaned from the 50 upwards. We have been down from the surface to the 20, where it is full of stuff, which fell in from the surface when the top of the shaft was removed. Eventually we hope for some tribute pitches here.</p>
<p>By the end of the month we hope to have Bunce’s Shaft down far enough to crosscut east and west towards the lodes.</p>
<p>Open work is being pushed on as fast as possible with the number of hands at our disposal, but some are frequently leaving for higher wages for short term jobs in well-sinking etc.</p>
<p>We have secured nine Cornish miners from a recent arrival at Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>Booborowie Council Clerk writes to say he has taken the job without profit, at £25 p.a., in order to rectify earlier bungling.</p>
<p>[He appears to be responding to slurs cast upon him, though the details of their nature are not clear from this letter.]</p>
<p>Letter from W. Peel Nesbitt, Government Medical Officer</p>
<p>Captain Sanders has attacked me in a manner I should not have expected from one professing friendship. He appears to have suffered from the delusion that ‘An Inhabitant’ is myself. But even that error does not excuse the deliberate misstatements which his letter contains. He says no fault has been found in Paxton Square by anyone with authority to do so. He knows it is my duty as Medical officer of Health to report such matters as I see fit, to the Board of Health in Adelaide. Captain Sanders says everyone except one (meaning me) has reported Paxton Square as being very healthy. Yet he knows the Inspector reported exactly the opposite and only the other day the President of the Board of Health said to one of our Councillors that the statements of the Inspector and myself were fully corroborated by what he had seen and heard in Paxton Square.</p>
<p>Unless his opinions have changed marvellously in the past month or two Dr Cave will bear me out that the place is a hotbed of disease. Captain Sanders says there is a letter to Sir Henry Ayers that there are no two families in the same house and where the largest numbers are, it is a husband, wife and small children. Dr Gosse remarked that common sense tells you that there could not be seven children all small. In fact in one house they were all ages from 21 downwards. If no one has found fault, why has Captain Sanders caused new pits to be dug? I am glad Captain Sanders is to treat this letter with silent contempt because in replying he would only further lower himself in the estimation of all thinking men.</p>
<p>Captain Sanders becomes quite gushing over the liberality of SAMA. I can only rejoice that Kapunda and Gawler have no such liberal companies in their midst.</p>
<p>‘An Inhabitant’ writes again, to affirm that Dr Nesbitt did not write his earlier letter and had no knowledge of its subject matter, or of its intended publication.</p>
<p>W. Howitt [Rector of St Mary’s]</p>
<p>The observations made in my sermon of 25 June were based on my own observations, on the reports of the Government Health Officer and of the Inspector of the central Board of Health and upon the fact that ten cases of typhoid prevailed in Paxton Square at the one time. Dr Gosse, Chairman of the Central Board of Health, inspected the Square last Friday and confirmed these reports. I do not think I need to offer any further justification of myself. The directors are nearly as much to blame as their local supervisor. The sanitary authorities agree that typhoid fever is the direct product of filth and defective drainage.</p>
<p>Scarlatina and typhoid fever have prevailed in Burra more or less for the two and a half years I have known it. It is quite within the lines of my duty, as I conceive it, to preach on this subject as on any other. Dirt is one form of evil and it is my conviction to do battle with evil in any and every form, whether moral or physical.</p>
<p>I, 2 (3), 14 July 1876, page 4 [The number of the issue is hand corrected to 3 on the microfilm.]</p>
<p>‘Inquisitive’ writes on Burra and its inhabitants, as an outsider.</p>
<p>Why do Kooringa people speak of The Burra when referring to the place? It only makes sense if followed by the word ‘Mine.’</p>
<p>[He then goes on to puzzle over the lack of information on Burra in gazetteers etc., but the plentiful references to Redruth, Aberdeen, Kooringa and ‘other peculiarly named places all included in ‘the Burra’ as locals term it. And yet how is a stranger to know that?]</p>
<p>If an inquisitive stranger takes up Boothby’s Directory for 1869, wherein there is reliable information on important places in SA, surely he will find Burra (Town and District), in a similar way to Kapunda (Town and District), but no; there is no ‘Burra.’</p>
<p>[The writer then elaborates on the importance of names and the inconvenience and disadvantages arising from the confusion caused by there being no town of Burra – especially as now there was a Corporation of Burra.]</p>

<p>Editorial on Education</p>
<p>We favour the extension of better Government schools in SA and the institution of the Training School and of Model Schools in Adelaide as well as the newly founded University of Adelaide. There is an eagerness in country areas to see new schools established under the new regulations. There is no doubt that we shall see in the course of reasonable time schools of a far superior class than those we have been accustomed to, scattered far and wide throughout the colony. It is probable that the Model Schools will prepare many pupil teachers for the Training School. Teaching now-a-days is made more interesting and less of a labour, both to the teacher and the taught. Children are taught to think; ideas are fixed in their mind, rather than mere words in their memories.</p>
<p>‘We hope it is not necessary to say anything to convince parents of the importance of giving their children a good education.’</p>
<p>The Burra Philharmonic is an established fact. On Friday Mr W.R. Ridgway was elected President with Mr J. Drew as Vice-President and a committee comprising Messrs Jarman, J. Kerr, F. Moody, J. Pearce, West, Holder and T. Drew. The first rehearsal will be held this evening.</p>

<p>Obituary. Francken Robson was brought into Burra on Monday night at about 12 o’clock, in a dying state. He had been staying at Aberdeen for two or three weeks and then went to Mr Dare’s at Piltimitiappa, where he was laid up with a severe cold for almost a fortnight. Dr Dashwood said there was nothing he could do, as the man had been dying for hours. The final cause of death was bronchitis. The deceased was an old colonist, having arrived on the Canton in 1838. Mr Dobney of Kooringa came in the same vessel and says the deceased was the son of Captain R.M. Robson, formerly of the East India Co. and he had previously resided at the Reedbeds [Adelaide] where he worked for the Government; he believed in the Customs service. It is though Robson had at one time been a sailor. He was discharged from the steamer Moolgewanke at Goolwa 18 September 1858. He was carrying a newspaper clipping from a Melbourne paper, supposedly from 1864, saying: ‘On 14th inst. at Sandhurst Eliza Anne, wife of Robert Moss Robson late of the East India Co. and mother of Mrs S.A. Crawford.’</p>
<p>The deceased was aged 42. [SA Deaths CD says Frank Robson died 18 July 1876 Kooringa, residence near Kooringa aged 40.]</p>

<p>Burra and Its Peculiarities: Chapter 1</p>
<p>[The author is surprised that when a local Burra paper appeared the name ‘Burra’ was not in the title. The Northern Mail was a name he associated more with Clare.</p>
<p>He says ‘Burra Burra’ interpreted in Austral-Anglo language is ‘Scratch-em-hole, Scratch-em-hole.’</p>
<p>‘A peculiarity indeed! It is funny.’</p>
<p>[According to G.H. Manning Place Names of SA the name Burra Burra is derived from early shepherds who used the ‘Hindoostanee’ term meaning ‘great-great’ and applied it to the creek. He also mentions an alternative view that it derives from a Shetland Islands term ‘Burra’ for a fortified Hill.]</p>
<p>He continues, to say that Burra has been officially used for the District and now for the Burra Town [i.e. in the name for the Corporation.] He suggests the editor grabs the name for use before a rival does so. It is important, he argues, that there be a Burra Herald or at least a Burra Something as opposed to a Kooringa Something.</p>
<p>‘Let them boil and bury Kooringa as a name.’</p>
<p>He agrees that locally it is not necessary to say Burra, ‘but for English, bush and district places, it is necessary to add that all communications from Kooringa, Aberdeen, Redruth, Princess Royal, Lostwithiel, Hampton, Princetown (I cannot complete the list), are all the one place, “Burra.”’]</p>
<p>R. Sanders writes another letter.</p>
<p>I know that ‘An Inhabitant’ was not Dr Nesbitt and no carefully reading my reply could infer that I alluded to him as such. Had he confined himself to an attempt to disprove my statements, although misrepresenting the case, (as he did,) I would not have trouble to reply.</p>
<p>But having paraded my name so conspicuously and frequently before the public, I feel it is my duty to deny his statements and in confirmation request you publish the enclosed letter. Many other proofs can be produced if necessary.</p>
<p>[The letter enclosed was from Dr Alfred Cave, who wrote as principal Mine Surgeon. He said:]</p>
<p>Typhoid did not start at Paxton Square, as there were several district cases in the weeks before the first case there.</p>
<p>I attended only two cases, saw two others and heard of one more, making a total of five in the Square: Hewitson, Tonkin, McKenny (fatal), unknown and Morris.</p>
<p>None of the houses to my knowledge are overcrowded and some are the largest and best ventilated in the district. The closets in the Square are in about the same state as they are everywhere else – that is people do not tap them until they are obliged.</p>
<p>Not only is Paxton Square not a hotbed of disease, but there is less sickness there than in any other part of the district, as can be proved by names of patients and dates of illness.</p>
<p>In the recent fatal epidemic of malignant scarlet fever there was one case in the Square and about twenty in the district.</p>
<p>[Obituary: Lavinia McKenney, wife of William McKenney, died 26 May 1876 aged 32.]</p>
<p>[Dr] W.H. Dashwood writes asking the paper to publish a letter of his, sent to the President of the Central Board of Health, Dr Gosse, but of which no notice was taken:</p>
<p>I have been a resident of Kooringa for 11 years and for over 10 years was Government Medical Officer and Mine Surgeon. I can safely assert the sanitary condition of the district is far better than it ever was and is far in advance of many others. There are no causes which would have a tendency to produce epidemic diseases. Formerly there were ashpits, cesspools, pigsties, closets, etc. in close proximity to dwellings, but these have to a great extent been removed. Thanks are due to the District Council and the SAMA cottages have never been so well attended to and more particularly Paxton Square.</p>
<p>‘A Lover of Fair Play’ writes wondering why the Government Medical Officer, if so concerned about conditions, did not complain first to the District Council and secondly did not take up the matter with SAMA before going to the Central Board of Health. He also queries whether Dr Goss could go from the station to the Mine, thoroughly examine a patient there and then thoroughly examine the disputed unsanitary parts of Kooringa, between his arrival on the 12.50 p.m. train and his departure on the 4.50 p.m. train.</p>

<p>Editorial on Technical Education.</p>
<p>[This article discussed the virtues of technical education in promoting the prosperity of the nation as well as increasing the wealth and status of the working class. This includes technical education beyond secondary school levels. It quotes from a speech given by Mr Rowland Rees MP for the Burra District, who spoke on the adoption of technical education in England after the Great Exhibition and of developments in other parts of Europe. This education was such as would ‘raise [the working class] in social position and in mental status; and if they make good use of the greater leisure time they enjoy under the eight hours system, neither their employers nor the public will have any reason to regret the shortening of the hours of labour.’]</p>
<p>Second Leader on ‘Our Prospects.</p>
<p>The 1876 growing season has been marked by sharp frosts and a lack of rain. This drought has been such as to suggest an end to the wave of prosperity which seemed to be settling upon the colony. Wool, wheat and copper prices are all down in the Home markets. Despite this great public works have been authorised. And much can be done to advance the colony. Deep ploughing can be undertaken in preparation for the next season. This has the virtue of trapping more of the moisture that does fall and in bringing minerals to the surface and into the reach of subsequent crops.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Committee completed the arrangements for the purchase of the Burra Hotel and the alterations necessary to make it suitable for a hospital will be started as soon as practicable. We believe this will give general satisfaction, as it has long been felt that the old hospital building [Bleak House] was insufficient for the wants of such a large district. The hotel contains forty rooms, so there will be ample room for both male and female patients. It is the intention of the committee to have part of the building available as bedrooms, to be let to persons visiting the town, who do not care to stop at a hotel. Prior to the purchase of the hotel the additions to the old building had been commenced, but the contractors have agreed to relinquish the work.</p>

<p>W. Peel Nesbitt, Government Medical Officer, writes in reply to ‘A Lover of Fair Play.’</p>
<p>It is the duty of the Government Medical Officer to report to the central Board of Health, there being no Local Board of Health in the district.</p>
<p>It was not my duty to apply to anyone else in the first place for several reasons:</p>
<p>An Inspector was required to examine the place reported.</p>
<p>He and not I complained of the accommodation and ventilation. I am the Government Medical Officer, not the District Council Medical Officer. The District Council has no jurisdiction in such matters and does not know about typhoid fever.</p>
<p>The Government Medical Officer is ex officio a Medical Officer of Health.</p>
<p>I have held the appointment since November.</p>
<p>‘Considering the circumstances under which Dr Dashwood ceased to hold the appointment, I am surprised that he should have alluded to it.’</p>
<p>To Dr Cave’s letter I would reply:</p>
<p>I have never said the first case of typhoid occurred in Paxton Square, but</p>
<p>There were 9 cases there to my knowledge. Dr Cave mentions one more (Morris) and I have seen one since, making a total of 11.</p>
<p>The fact that there are other places as bad or worse does not make Paxton Square good.</p>
<p>&amp; 5. Dr Cave says there was only one case of scarlatina in Paxton Square. How does he know how many I saw? And how many had no medical attendance at all? I saw three cases there. He says that the place is not a hotbed of disease and I said that unless his opinions had undergone a marvellous change he would bear me out. ‘I can only regret they should have thus changed.’</p>
<p>To show I was not making a statement without foundation, I will quote a few figures. The population of Burra at the last census was over 3,300. The population of Paxton Square according to Captain Sanders is 161. Dr Cave says there were 20 cases of scarlatina in the district and taking Dr Cave’s estimation of the number of cases (1) Paxton Square had more than its share, but including the cases I know of (4), it had more than three times its share.</p>
<p>Yet Dr Cave says there is less sickness there than in any other parts of the district. Also Mr Daniel’s and Dr Cave’s own houses, though not actually, are, for all sanitary purposes, virtually in Paxton Square and in both fatal cases occurred. By Dr Cave’s statement if Paxton Square had less sickness that any other part of the district there should have been over 100 cases of typhoid in the district and by my figure of 11 cases, the district should have had more than 220.</p>
<p>Captain Sanders accuses me of ‘interfering’ and is then surprised that I resent it.</p>
<p>‘Let Dr Cave write on this subject to Board of Health in Adelaide and see if those gentlemen do not place as much reliance on his statements as they did on those of Captain Sanders and Dr Dashwood.</p>
<p>[Dr Nesbitt then names the scarlatina cases in Paxton Square.]</p>
<p>Robert Sanders writes to say that neither Dr Nesbitt nor anyone else had ever made a complaint to him about the sanitary conditions of the miners’ cottages in Kooringa. He says, had they done so, and had the complaint on investigation been proved to be correct, action to remedy the problem would have been taken without delay.</p>
<p>‘A Golddigger’ writes concerning the discovery of a gold reef about ten miles south of the old Waukaringa Reef, claiming it should go about 4 oz to the ton. He is amazed that this has not stirred SA into action. The whole show may come to nothing for the lack of a little ‘pushing in the matter’ from SA. He suggests other colonies behave differently and even SA is prepared to spend money in the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>I am not a personal friend of Dr Nesbitt and neither am I a banker, banker’s clerk, clergyman nor one of the doctor’s late committee. I can give an impartial opinion and having watched this debate from the start I have reached the following conclusions:</p>
<p>Dr Nesbitt was right to take his complaint to his superior officer, Dr Gosse, as the District Council is not being recognised by the Board of Health.</p>
<p>He might have brought the matter to the attention of Captain Saunders because of his position in the Mine relative to the houses in question. I am inclined to think he never thought of such a course.</p>
<p>Dr Nesbitt has no personal or mean motives in this controversy – it is, after all, more to his advantage than otherwise if people are sick.</p>
<p>It is evident that Dr Cave was once of Dr Nesbitt’s opinion with respect to the sickness in Paxton Square, but because of his position as Mine Surgeon is anxious to keep in favour with Captain Sanders and so gave up his manliness and now says what Captain Sanders tells him to say.</p>
<p>Is it not strange that Dr Cave, Dr Dashwood, Captain Sanders and ‘A Lover of Fair Play’ should all send in letters at the same time, taking the same view?</p>
<p>I can understand Captain Sanders and Mr West becoming annoyed at a suggestion of neglect of duty on their part, though I do not think that was Dr Nesbitt’s intention. I an sure the inhabitants of the Square are grateful for Dr Nesbitt’s course, which has resulted in the company improving their homes.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Kooringa are fortunate to have secured the services of so able a gentleman; a man of independent character whose social life is above reproach. I regret that the matter has become so personal.</p>
<p>‘Another Lover of Fair Play’</p>
<p>[The editor indicates that this debate has been going on long enough and that after this week further comments will have to appear as advertisements.]</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>I scarcely know whether to be vexed or amused at Dr Nesbitt’s presumption in attacking me so unjustly. I simply quoted my experience of the sanitary condition of the Kooringa District without alluding to him in any way. I do not as a general rule indulge in personalities of any description, nor is it my desire to make an attack on a young man just starting in life. My letter was addressed to the gentlemen forming the Central Board of Health and not to any outside individual. I have only to add that the mistakes made by the writer ‘Wm Peel Nesbitt’ are too numerous for me to mention and if he challenges me again I will expose him to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>W.H. Dashwood</p>
<p>P.S. I have no intention of leaving the district as reported.</p>
<p>[Note that Dr Dashwood’s competence came into question on the matter of typhoid in an inquest into the death of Sarah Ann Fogarty reported in the paper of 2 August 1878 and within a few months he had been replaced by Dr Sangster.]</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>I would like to say a few words in self defence, as I had no wish to be brought into this unpleasant controversy. It seems a pity for medical men to quarrel, as occasionally they are compelled to work together; hence I am surprised Dr Nesbitt should have purposely laid himself out to war with me. He asserts that ‘my statements are no more to be relied on than my friendship’, but I would remind him that his general behaviour makes it impossible for any straightforward man to be friendly with him for any length of time.</p>
<p>As he has made so much noise about Paxton Square I think I can prove to the public that he first manufactured typhoid fever at his own home and then sent it into the square by his servant, as both his groom and groom’s wife suffered from the disease while in his house. Dr Nesbitt was asked to remove a large quantity of manure and rubbish from the back of his premises. Shortly after this his servants fell ill. As the groom’s wife, Mrs Hewitson, was expecting to be confined every day, he sent her to Mrs Tonkin’s in the Square, next door to Andrew’s. She was very ill for ten days and was then confined. Dr Nesbitt could not make out the nature of her illness. I was called in consultation and pointed out she was suffering from typhoid fever. A day or two later one of the Andrews took it, then Mrs Tonkin. I have since found three others in the Andrews family also suffered. Northey and Morris had it only mildly.</p>
<p>Dr Nesbitt misrepresents my letter to Captain Sanders.</p>
<p>I said twenty cases of malignant scarlet fever, of which one was in Paxton Square; Dr Nesbitt’s patient, who died. Ordinary scarlatina was scattered through the district with hundreds of cases. The twenty I alluded to were all very severe, and out of them thirteen died. Let Dr Nesbitt behave himself as a gentleman and he will not find any occasion to abuse me again.</p>
<p>Alfred Cave.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>In your last issue I see that one of the parties has answered and the other partly answered my questions about the sanitary conditions of Kooringa and of Paxton Square in particular. While the medical gentleman answers some, he evades others on the plea that those answers are included in the former. In a strict sens perhaps this is so, but I think courtesy would have indicated to him the propriety of first calling attention of the SA Mining Assoc. manager to the condition of their property, before taking the step of complaining to the Board of Health, thereby bringing the company into public contempt in a matter of which they were quite ignorant.</p>
<p>Why should a complaint be made against Paxton Square when there are other places in a worse state? The public think he should have pointed out the worst places first. His actions must have been due to either want of judgement, lack of courtesy, or a desire to take the ‘rise’ out of the company.</p>
<p>The Medical Officers between them are well able to answer for themselves, but it seems strange that, while accusing Dr Cave of being reckless with logic, he himself is so unlogical [sic] as to attempt to show by figures that Paxton Square has had more than its fair share of scarlatina and typhoid, when it is a well known fact that cases of fever frequently occur in outside and isolated localities where the sanitary condition is good and from the burlesque of an inspection that has been made, this may be the case in Paxton Square, for anything the public may know to the contrary. Before the public can come to any fair conclusion we must have a thorough inspection at which the Corporation and all interested parties should be present to see there is such a thing as a hotbed of disease in our midst.</p>

<p>Burra and Its Peculiarities Chapter II</p>
<p>Burra has not been without its mistakes from the start. It had a survey of four square miles without reservation of roads in any direction – a peculiarity it shared with the nobs’ mining property of Princess Royal. The bush tracks through the town up to 1864 (I write from memory only) were an impassable bog, better imagined than described. Previous to that year the Government, considering it necessary to remedy such a disgrace, sent up a surveyor to peg out a road preparatory to macadamising, although it was on private property. The resident agent, when the work was about completed, displaced all the pegs. The Government then passed an Act to carry out the work. The result was a hard road from the Burra Hotel to the Government Post Office, though off it in any direction was bad travelling, especially for that short piece from it to the nice wooden bridge the inhabitants had erected over the creek. This was so bad bushmen designated it Mud Street. [Thames Street to Bridge Street.]</p>
<p>Time and money have repaired many of the bad places and the greatest permanent work of note has been the railway to within a mile of the town. When the mine operations were suspended a few years ago the town’s condition was truly deplorable, which was not improved by the prevailing drought. Since then Burra has shared in the benefits conferred by the Strangways Act, which allowed some of the land to be opened for agriculture.</p>
<p>Even so settlers could not have bought land and then the necessary farming equipment and seed wheat and then survived a two year wait for a return on their capital, had not the local bank advanced money to some tradesmen, enabling them in turn to extend credit to the struggling farmers. This gave the fading town a start. Local tradesmen who had capital derived from profits in palmy days also extended credit. It was a trying time. Many tradesmen later grew fearful of their exposure and reacted by seeking to recover by increasing their prices to compensate and limiting credit. They then went too far and the farmers, as they paid off their credit debts, have turned to the railway and Adelaide suppliers as a cheaper option. Fortunately the number of new farmers has compensated for the older ones turning to Adelaide.</p>
<p>I am reliably informed that a new farm of only 80 acres is likely to require capital of £500 and so necessitate most new farmers needing credit for four or more years. Unless Burra traders reduce their charges to something like Adelaide prices, trade in Burra will decline. When out of debt, the Baldina and Bright farmers may, in two or three years’ time, turn to Adelaide as earlier settlers have done.</p>
<p>Income from the extension of the railway to Hallett will also be ceasing by then, so it is time for local industries to be developing themselves as much as possible.</p>
<p>The lack of early road connections still hinders development. Trade with the Hundred of Bright would be easier with a road along the creek through Princess Royal property. The alternative route over Breakneck Hill is difficult and discourages trade from Bright.

<p>Editorial on The Eastern Road. [Burra-Morgan Road]</p>
<p>From what transpired at a meeting of the Midland Road Board on Wednesday we are of the opinion that a great misunderstanding has arisen on this issue, resulting in a contest between the two ends of the town.</p>
<p>Redruth and Aberdeen are fighting for a road via Diprose’s Creek, under the impression that Kooringa wished to retain the existing road over the Breakneck Hill and if they did that the steep gradients of the present road would be forced upon the district.</p>
<p>The remarks of Messrs Warnes, Lane and others, however, suggest neither party wants Breakneck Hill. The opposition really wants a deviation via Nankivell’s Gully and over a natural saddle in the hills. This they say would reduce the number of bridges required from five to two with no significant difference in the gradient. Having only limited acquaintance with the terrain, we will not hazard an opinion as to the better course, but at least it needs to be judged on the correct information. Perhaps the best solution would be for a public meeting to reach an equitable decision.</p>
<p>The Second Leader discusses the activities in Parliament in the past week. The Legislative Council is considering a law requiring all vehicles within 10 miles of a Corporate Town to carry lamps after dark – previously a requirement only in the city.</p>
<p>The Burra-Hallett Railway Bill has passed.</p>
<p>Commonage. A Baldina settler is complaining that having paid £40 for commonage rights it is not available.</p>
<p>Copper. Mr Grenfell and party have made a rich discovery of copper about 11 miles south of the Burra Mine. It is a north-south running lode some two feet wide of grey ore mixed with gossan. Sinking has begun. [Wheal Grenfell.]</p>
<p>Accident. Yesterday a boy standing on the road by Orchard’s Hotel Aberdeen was knocked down by the shaft of Dr Nesbitt’s buggy as it passed. Miraculously the horse and the vehicle both passed over him without touching the boy who escaped with a shaking.</p>
<p>Fire broke out in Mrs Green’s boarding house at Kooringa this morning at 2 a.m. When help arrived Mrs Green was alight and the door leading to a bedroom was burnt half-way through and some articles were damaged. The cause is not known.</p>
<p>Accident. Mr Henderson of Statton &amp; Henderson had a little finger of his right hand severely cut in a circular saw about a fortnight ago. It has now had to be amputated.</p>
<p>Baldina. New settlers are busy ploughing the ground. A recent visit revealed only one crop and that very backward on account of the dryness of the season.</p>
<p>Weather. There has been widespread rain in the [western] agricultural areas from last Saturday to Tuesday. Burra recorded 1.31 inches for the week.</p>
<p>Redruth Primitive Methodist Church had special services on 6 &amp; 7 August in aid of the Kooringa Manse Fund. Rev. E. Masterman of North Adelaide preached on Sunday and his address at Monday’s tea meeting was on ‘Missionary Life and Labours in London’.</p>

<p>Mt Bryan Correspondent wonders if the Burra-Mt Bryan road is well placed in being at the bottom of the valley. He says he has been told that 100 tons of stone were placed in a small section of it near the Mt Bryan Hotel without stopping that part being a creek after rain. It may be better when the railway reduces road traffic. He also complains that the wholesale immigration going on is depressing wages. They have fallen from about £1 a week to 15/- when the former will scarcely support a wife and family in these times of high prices.</p>

<p>Public safety concerns included the state of the footbridge leading to the cemetery, an uncovered shaft near the Gaol, a dangerous gutter near Mr Harris’s, stones sticking up through footpaths, a dangerous well near the White Hart Hotel and a dangerous open quarry at Hampton where one man had already been killed.</p>
<p>D. Wells was commended and has handed over to the Corporation profits of £157 from his time in managing the cemetery.</p>
<p>Kooringa Wesleyan Church</p>
<p>Rev. D. O’Donnell of Clare’s lecture on Temperance at the Institute on Saturday was postponed when heavy rain produced a very small attendance. He preached twice at the Kooringa Wesleyan Church on Sunday and on Monday at the Institute delivered an address on ‘Tom Hood: his life, character and works’. Poor weather again reduced his audience. The Temperance lecture was given on Tuesday to an audience that was not large, but ‘respectably filled’ the hall.</p>
<p>Midland Road Board at Riverton Court House 9 August: a special meeting to consider the route of the road from Kooringa to North West Bend via Baldina.</p>
<p>The Clerk read the notice in the Government Gazette 13 July of the intention to approve a deviation of road 92 via Redruth.</p>
<p>Cr Warnes &amp; J.A. Goodfellow attended on behalf of J. Harris, SA Mining Association and Burra District Council, to protest this deviation.</p>
<p>Mr Warnes said nearly all the land in Baldina lay south of the existing track and only 10% on the north side. All the traffic south of the track would naturally go by Mr Cowper’s head station and thence to a point at the corner of section 224. If the road were diverted and laid down via Diprose’s Creek this traffic would have to go round from that corner 38 chains 74 links to get into the road then 335 chains to get into Aberdeen and 78 chains from there to Kooringa. In all 452 chains.</p>
<p>By the road already surveyed the same point was 316 chains from Kooringa thus representing an extra distance inwards and outwards of 4 miles 28 chains against the proposed deviation. Kooringa contained most of the public buildings – Post &amp; Telegraph Office, Institute, Hospital and Cemetery. The proposed deviation would saddle the Burra District Council with an expensive piece of road.</p>
<p>The road need not go over Breakneck Hill, but by an easier route up Nankivell’s Gully and thence southeast over the saddle in the hills, with no severe gradients and the distance about the same.</p>
<p>The Burra District Council did not care whether the road went directly into Kooringa or round by Redruth they only wanted to get the present road off their shoulders. The Nankivells’ Gully route would require two bridges compared with five in the proposed deviation via Diprose’s Creek. Mr Harris objected to having his paddock cut into two or three pieces as required by the new deviation.</p>
<p>Mr Moule thought the road would have to start at the post office. He said the extra distance to Kooringa via Diprose’s Creek would be three-quarters of a mile longer, but it would be 74 chains shorter to the railway station. He also said that the Act required the road to go from Kooringa to North West Bend via Baldina, so it would have to start in Kooringa.</p>
<p>Mr Warnes pointed out that to start at the post office it would have to travel over a mile of main road 14.</p>
<p>Mr Goodfellow, as Clerk of the District Council, produced a letter from the District Council to the Commissioner of Crown Lands in September 1874 requesting the road be from the Burra Railway Station to North West Bend. The letter pointed out that the wording of the Bill as it was could apply to either one of two roads, or to a road and a track.</p>
<p>The Commissioner then had the Bill amended to read from Kooringa via Baldina to the North West Bend. The Commissioner thought that removed any ambiguity.</p>
<p>Mr Warnes said the present road had been surveyed by the Council and approved by the Governor. The Board did not propose to close the old road, merely to leave it, whereupon it would become a burden to the Council.</p>
<p>Mr Bakewell appeared to represent John Drew and others. He argued that the change in the Legislative Council to read from Kooringa instead of from the Railway Station meant that the Board had no power to make the road from Redruth as suggested and if they proceeded, he believed their decision could be set aside by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mr P. Lane and Captain Sanders appeared for the Burra Corporation [Town Council]. Mr Lane said Kooringa had 1,500 to 2,000 residents – more than Redruth and Aberdeen combined – and ought not to be ignored. The District Council favoured the road via Nankivell’s Gully, which would serve nearly all those who would be served by the proposed road into Redruth, except for about 12 houses. The road via Diprose’s Creek would cost a great deal more to make it passable.</p>
<p>Captain Sanders also said the route via Diprose’s Creek would cost considerably more and he supported the route recommended by Messrs Warnes and Lane. He said about 25,000 tons of firewood was brought in annually.</p>
<p>Mr Ridgway presented a memorial with 149 signatures in favour of the deviation via Diprose’s Creek. The inhabitants for whom he appeared believed the Board had gone carefully into the matter and had reached the correct conclusion. [He used statistics of loads and costs to bolster his opinion.]</p>
<p>Mr Butterworth supported the road via Redruth. He believed the road recommended by the Board was the best and did not see why wood and wheat should pass through Kooringa.</p>
<p>Mr Tiver also supported the Redruth road. The route over Breakneck Hill would cost more in maintenance than the making of the other. The Redruth road had easier gradients.</p>
<p>Messrs G. Sara &amp; A. Bartholomæus supported Mr Ridgway’s memorial.</p>
<p>Mr Warnes argued that if the road went to Redruth a great proportion of the traffic would have to come back to the Mine and to Kooringa.</p>
<p>Captain Sanders said the wood traffic to one mill, the Mine and Kooringa would be 17,000 tons per annum and this would have to come round via Redruth if the Board’s proposal stood.</p>
<p>Mr Moule moved that a decision be made on 29 November, allowing members of the Board time to visit the district.</p>
<p>J. Rookwood of Kooringa expresses his disgust at the state of the cemetery at Kooringa.</p>
<p>‘There is in this township an old cemetery, in a foul and disgraceful state – trodden down by goats, rooted up by pigs, crossed over by drays, and if not stopped the floodwaters will soon furrow itself [sic] deep into the graves and wash the bones into the creek and away into space.’</p>
<p>‘In this spot lie the bones of the discoverer of the famous Burra Mine, and many who shortened their lives in developing that which has led to many now resident in the Burra being independent. Gratitude for these benefits ought to enlist the sympathy of the old and shame the young into protecting a spot where so many now lie at rest.’</p>
<p>He says the cemetery ‘as a disgrace to a Christian community cannot be equalled in the whole of Australia.’</p>
<p>Burra and Its Peculiarities Chapter III. Appearances Past and Present.</p>
<p>Bushmen are to be found who can tell how a certain shepherd who lived in a hut on the Mine Hill was struck with the peculiar brown metallic stones with which his hut’s chimney was built. He took samples of the stone to Adelaide and this led to an inspection in which the hut’s chimney was almost entirely carted away as malleable copper by a company being formed, which brought miners into the locality. These soon housed themselves in dugouts in the creek bank, excavating good-sized dwelling rooms and sank well-like holes into the upper surfaces to form chimneys. The door entrances were towards the creek, then with a forest of gums and mallee along its banks. These cosy dwellings were ruined by a storm which swept their primitive furniture down the rushing creek. (Fair remains of a few rooms are yet to be seen in the banks east of the Baptist chapel.) By this time the forest was much thinned for firewood and fair building stone had been discovered.</p>
<p>The company and miners erected substantial houses on 21 year leases. An abundance of copper ran the £5 shares up to more than £100 each. In time expensive machinery was needed to keep the water down in the mine, but the profits justified the expense and the town grew to good proportions.</p>
<p>In laying out the township the company’s directors determined that only one hotel and two inns should be upon their property: viz. the Burra Hotel, the Miners’ Arms and the Pig and Whistle.</p>
<p>The hotel was well-planned, but in building insufficient attention was given to keep the storm waters coming down the hill from running into the cellars. These filled with water, which damaged the walls and led to the building of unsightly abutments to keep them up, which in turn provoked Governor Ferguson’s expression that ‘it looked like a prison’. Its unsightliness is increased by its approach ‘at present, a disordered boulder-stone surfaced sideling.’ No attempt has been made to improve it.</p>
<p>‘Having formerly driven my buggy and pair to the front of Burra’s – then only stately edifice – to alight therefrom upon either of the two grand flights of steps, (i.e. with untrimmed and otherwise roughly bedded slate steps), to gain the superb promenade (also paved with rough, untrimmed slates, with jagged edges which, without careful treading, fling one down), where wealthy persons were in conversation, some leaning against the magnificent pillars (roughly squared and planed common wood, with the edges taken off, which support the equally primitive verandah, gaping for paint.) Others reclining upon the accurately carved and polished rails (i.e. names &amp;c., carved with penknives, and polished by lolling elbows), perhaps awaiting the summons of the ponderous-sounding dinner-bell preparatory to the demand for the many half-crowns for the really sumptuous ordinary.’</p>
<p>The position has become rather remote since the opening of the railway.</p>
<p>The cellars are very large scale and worth inspection.</p>
<p>One wonders how the large room has not tumbled ‘for even as long ago as ten years, the floors were rewedged up upon deals endwise, and notwithstanding this, new keepers were never deterred from undertaking the risk of the thumping from large audiences on the frail flooring.’</p>
<p>I believe the hotel consists of about forty rooms in all.</p>
<p>The two inns have also provided well for their keepers.</p>
<p>As far as housing ‘the township could boast of nothing better in appearance than labourers’ common cottages for private dwellings until the last two or three years, which gave the stranger, at entrance, the common idea of poverty, nothing more delusive can be conceived, for within are furniture, pictures and articles of virtu, the owners of which can afford, and have spent to the tune of twenty pounds sterling weekly upon their families, although the outer appearance and construction of the dwellings would fail to give the stranger an idea of the interior other than a three-legged chair, and broken crockery to match. Most of the dwellings are in no better state at the present time, and the exceptions so few that the stranger fails to distinguish anything different at first sight.</p>
<p>Herein is a peculiarity, the likes of which is never met with elsewhere; and stranger still, the inhabitants have become so familiar to the poverty of exterior by old association of memory, that like labourers when taking possession of recently-ruined castles, they think themselves very grand, and expect strangers to imbibe the like notions, which would certainly be another peculiarity if adopted.’</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine</p>
<p>Captain Sanders’ Report 5 August</p>
<p>Morphett’s Engine Shaft has been sunk a further 8 ft 9 inches in the last month and a further 7 ft will bring us to 85 fathoms. By the end of September we hope to see the shaft divided and secured so as to haul with whim engine from that level. The inflow of water into crosscut at the 70 is causing problems. The 70 driving north on lode is bursting with water, but contains rich stores of grey ore. This level is far from ventilation and so we will start on Monday to sink a winze from the 60. When holed we will be able to run Waterhouse’s Shaft to the 70 and prove the ground for a considerable distance north. Peacock’s Air Shaft is holed to the 50 and we will sink to the 60 and also drive north. Ayer’s old shaft has been cleared through from the 50 to the surface and a whim is being erected and when the shaft is secure we will let tribute pitches. Roach’s Shaft is secured from the 50 to the 55. We will divert a stream of water from Roach’s Shaft by clearing a level towards a winze to the 60, which will ventilate the 60 to that point.</p>
<p>[There is further detail of clearing out old workings to allow access and ventilation for the purpose of proving new ground or letting tribute pitches.] Surface work is being pushed on with dispatch.</p>

<p>We cannot recall in England rabbits multiplying such as to threaten crops, but in these warmer climates they threaten to eat the inhabitants out of house and home. Legislation against them has been found necessary in Tasmania and New Zealand, even more strongly than in SA, but if we do not act very actively we can expect very serious results within five years.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr W. Harcus JP, the editor of the Advertiser, Express &amp; Chronicle died on 10 August. He was an acknowledged leader of the free press in SA, fearlessly exposing falsehood, cant and hypocrisy, while seldom being bitter. He wrote boldly and impartially. In the past fourteen years he has raised the tone of colonial journalism. He first joined the Register and in 1867became associated with the late Mr J.H. Barrow in the Advertiser. He wrote as ‘Onkaparinga’ in the English Field newspaper in answer to Mr Kingsley’s misrepresentations of the colony under the name ‘Post and Rail’. He prepared the last two handbooks on SA.</p>
<p>He was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne and was educated for the Independent Ministry at Cotton-End College Bedfordshire and subsequently had a series of positions in charge of churches in the north of England. In 1860 he came to SA to take charge of Clayton Church, Kensington and in 1865 left that role to join the Register. He occasionally continued to preach when his services were required. He is survived by a widow, three sons, three daughters and three grandchildren.</p>
<p>[William Harcus died 10 August 1976 Hackney SA aged 53.]</p>

<p>Wheal Grenfell. Last issue we said Mr Grenfell and party had discovered a lode of copper near Sod Hut. Some 17 years ago Captain Killicoat discovered copper in the same locality and briefly worked the mine with some success. The men who had worked for him also opened up some ground about 200 yards southeast of his shaft, but had not the capital to develop it. The present party prospected on the west side of a watercourse running north from the shaft last mentioned. On 7 May a lode about 20 yards from the old shaft was discovered. A sample gave good results and a lease has now been obtained. Shaft No. 2 has been started twenty yards west northwest of their first find. In this they have found the lode mentioned last issue. It contains some splendid ore. We think the proprietors are justified in anticipating great results.</p>

<p>Redruth Ford. A report was received suggesting deep piles were needed at considerable expense. Cr Sanders thought this was excessive and a few only were required. The Surveyor thought a few loads of slag would serve for two or three years. [It is not clear whether this was the main road ford, which was actually in Aberdeen, or the St Just Street Ford in Redruth. The former seems more likely given the expenses contemplated.]</p>
<p>The mayor argued that Burra had been hard done by with respect to its main road grants compared with many other places. It was resolved His Worship attend the next meeting of the Road Board and urge upon them the unfairness of the proposed apportionment.</p>
<p>Inquest on the fire at Mrs Green’s Boarding House: held at the Miners’ Arms Hotel last Friday 11 August before J.D. Cave JP, with F.W. Moody as foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>Frances Vivian, a next door neighbour, said she was awakened by the smell of fire and the screams of a woman, between 12.30 and 1 a.m. on Friday morning. She found Mrs Green about two yards from her back door with the back of her dress alight. Mrs Green called out that her house was on fire and asked her to call Mr Vivian.</p>
<p>Mrs Vivian took her three children to a safe place and then extinguished Mrs Green’s clothes and called neighbours for help. She did not enter Green’s house.</p>
<p>William Bullen, another near neighbour, was awoken by Mrs Vivian’s cries. He and Mr Vivian entered Green’s house and saw her and a man standing close together in the back room. The back of Mrs Green’s dress was alight. The door and three boxes of clothing were also alight. They threw water over the door and carried the boxes outside. Of the two carpetbags hanging behind the door, one was consumed and the other partly burnt. There were three men in the house whom Mrs Green said were lodgers. Two of them were asleep in the front room and the other was standing with Mrs Green in the bedroom.</p>
<p>John Vivian’s evidence varied only slightly from Mr Bullen’s.</p>
<p>J. Drew said he and Vivian had gone into the room and looked around, but could find no clear source for the fire. They could not wake the sleeping men and believed they were drunk.</p>
<p>Mary Green said she was awakened by the fire and raised the alarm. She had retired about 10 p.m. and was sure she had put out the candle. She denied she was drunk. On rising she had put on clothes, which she afterwards was told were on fire. It was her bustle which was on fire – she had worn it for the last twenty years. A bottle of brandy was brought into the house on Thursday, but there had been four to drink it. Two women had visited on Thursday.</p>
<p>George Mayger said he went to Mrs Green’s house about 1 a.m. Friday and saw some boxes smouldering outside. He met Mrs Green with her bustle on fire and the back part of her dress burnt. He went inside, but found all had been extinguished. He could not see any cause for the fire.</p>
<p>The jury’s verdict was that a fire had been caused by carelessness, through Mrs Green and her lodgers having partaken of too much intoxicating liquor.</p>

This made people unwilling to invest in improvements and SAMA had only just begun to sell some allotments. This explains the general poor state of housing in the town and the apparent lack of maintenance. When houses became vacant the policy of SAMA was to remove the roof and otherwise destroy them. There was some improvement as the mine reopened, the railway arrived and agricultural settlement spread.</p>
<p>In recent times improvements included a trader erecting a house worth £800 - a brewery, a new assembly room at one of the two inns, the completion of the Institute, the R.C. Chapel and more building at Aberdeen. The writer complains that too much paint is appearing on the outside of buildings. The main road through town is now quite good, though the footpaths are generally poor. Roads to and from the town are also good except for the road to Baldina and as SAMA has begun to sell land improvement can be expected to continue.</p>
<p>Redruth had the foundations laid for an Anglican Church, but after 20 years it had got no further.</p>
<p>The original road north was frustrated by the Mine and had to go into the hills to Cobb&rsquo;s Farm to reach the Mt Bryan Plain. Later the Mine built a road through sections 9 &amp; 42 but fenced both sides to favour trade in Kooringa.</p>
<p>The sanitary aspect was always poor and SAMA took little interest in it till the temporary closure of the mine. As lease rent could not then be paid at the Mine Office a rent collector was appointed and it was he who began to see that improvements were made.</p>

<p>Sanitation in Kooringa: Report of libel case arising out of the debate reported earlier.</p>
<p>Nesbitt v. Cave for damages of £2,000.</p>
<p>In July the rev, H. Howitt of St Mary&rsquo;s Kooringa preached a sermon on the text than cleanliness is next to godliness in which he referred to the poor state of sanitation of Paxton Square houses and the apathy of SAMA to the state of dwellings and the comfort of the inhabitants. A summary appeared in the Northern Mail and a warm discussion followed. Mine officials challenged the truth of the sermon statements. Taking part were the Govt. Medical Officer at Kooringa and the defendant who is a doctor in the same town and a mine doctor. Cave made a report to the mine officials denying the plaintiff&rsquo;s assertion that a recent typhoid outbreak had arisen on the property of SAMA. Nesbitt then wrote another letter in which he said that Cave&rsquo;s arguments were as reliable as his friendship and his statements would receive as much attention from the Central Board of Health as Captain Sander&rsquo;s statements had received.</p>
<p>Cave then published a rejoinder in which he said it was impossible for anyone to be long friends with Nesbitt who had manufactured the epidemic by sending his (i.e. Nesbitt&rsquo;s) groom&rsquo;s wife, while suffering from typhoid fever, to lodge at a house in Paxton&rsquo;s Square and she had caught the fever owing to Nesbitt&rsquo;s having allowed filth to accumulate at the back of his house and he knew so little of the symptoms of the disease that he had to be told what the woman was suffering from.</p>
<p>The judge ruled that unless it could be shown that any of the statements were false to the defendant&rsquo;s knowledge, the case would be decided by reference to Laughton v. the Bishop of Soder and Man and would not go to jury. The plaintiff&rsquo;s evidence was ruled largely inadmissible as proof of malice. Henry Pether, proprietor of the Northern Mail, was called with the original letter that started the case and showed that the original had been toned down somewhat before being published. Despite protracted legal argument on both sides it was ruled that it was a nonsuit.</p>

<p>Rifle Club Meeting</p>
<p>Hallett railway: work had been temporarily halted on the embankment pending a decision on the underpass near the White Hart which the council wanted. Council felt that a crossing to serve the mill would not be possible as the embankment there would be too low.</p>
<p>Hon. John Colton, Commissioner of Public Works had come on 29 Nov. by special train to look at the problem and seemed to have been immediately waylaid to open the Wesleyan Bazaar. After that he visited the line as far as Mt Bryan and then the Mine. He was given a memorial requesting a ‘truck’ be added to the passenger train on Tuesdays and Thursdays as it presently was on Saturdays to bring fresh fruit and vegetables because current arrangements disadvantaged out of town customers</p>

<p>Burra Hospital: Jan 10 the Burra Hospital Committee reported that part of the building was ready for use.</p>
<p>Short report on history of the hospital.</p>
<p>28 Sep. 1875 Capt. Killicoat, Chairman of the District Council convened a meeting to form a committee to establish a hospital.</p>
<p>The original idea was to use the old Mine Hospital near Aberdeen [Bleak House] and SAMA directors donated the land and building for that purpose. On 1st meeting of the committee 4 Oct 1875, John Drew (Chair), J.D. Cave (Sec.), Drs Gosse, Peel and Jackson - local practitioners were invited to advise on the adaptations needed. Designs were drawn up and a contract let to G &amp; W Sara for £1,791/14/- and the property was valued at £467/16/- and its land at £100. A Public subscription of £612 in addition to the Govt. subsidy was needed.</p>
<p>Just as work was about to start the committee learned that the lease of the Burra Hotel was available to them on advantageous terms. The committee decided that if freehold could be got and the contractor would agree to forego the contract they would prefer the Burra Hotel site.</p>
<p>This turned out to be possible and SAMA directors agreed to take back the old Aberdeen site and grant freehold to the Burra Hotel site. Value of the new property was estimated at £2,547/15/9. The conveyance of the property to the town corporation is daily expected. The new hospital is free of the noise of the mine stamps and of the flour mill as well as the dust of the main road and is nearer the residences of the local doctors. Occupation should be possible by 20 Jan. 1877</p>
<p>Offence: James Burns was fined 5/- for playing a bugle on the balcony of the Commercial Hotel at 3 or 4 am on New Year&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<p>The delegation failed to alter the board&rsquo;s decision to favour Diprose&rsquo;s Creek.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital &amp; School: 29th Jan. meeting to organize celebrations for the opening of the hospital and laying of school&rsquo;s foundation stone. Decided to have both on same day and that T.

<p>Hallett railway: The embankment to the railway was now obstructing ingress and egress at Butterworth&rsquo;s Mill. Butterworth thought that an underpass was feasible as the bank was 12&rsquo; high and that would be better than the proposed crossing by the Bon Accord which was on a hill.</p>
<p>Recreation ground: Council voted to apply to the Bon Accord Mine for fee simple over allotments 1-8 &amp; 13 for use as a recreation ground. [West of Jenkin St, near the railway station.] Deputation was to meet SAMA directors over the recreation ground in Kooringa, but Mr West, the mine accountant wrote saying SAMA could not agree to transfer the land near Paxton Square.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary Garrett Smith, farmer, found lying dead near the railway turntable apparently having been struck by the cowcatcher of a locomotive while drunk. The accident was not detected when it happened. When the body was found there were eight £10 notes, seventeen £1 notes, 11/3 in silver and 6d in copper nearby on the ground and three £5 notes in his pocket. [£102 was a huge sum and must equate to over $25,000 in 2000 values and yet this draws no particular comment from the paper! A &lsquo;good man&rsquo; is cited in the paper as earning perhaps £2/2/- a week. Died 7 February 1877 Burra Railway Station aged 45.]</p>

Shown over hospital and then opening took place in the lobby. Ayers introduced by the architect William Beattie. An unremarkable speech was followed by lunch in what had been the old Burra Hotel Assembly Room. (Provided by the Commercial Hotel)</p>
<p>After lunch all went to the Institute to form a procession led by Burra Brass Band, then 20 Freemasons &amp; The Oddfellows, Foresters, &amp; Rechabites; all in full regalia. Then came Ayers and members of the ministry, the Mayor and members of the Corporation and Mr Bath. (c. 160 Friendly Society members in all.)</p>
<p>Burra School: About 1,500 gathered at the school - it being a half holiday for businesses in the town. To the north and east of the building site were some 900 children from the various Sabbath Schools. The stone was laid by Thomas Bath as the earliest established businessman in Burra. The school was intended for 800-900 children and should be completed by the end of 1877 at a cost of £6976 [by Sara &amp; Dunstan]</p>
<p>Dinner was held at the old Assembly Room in the hospital. Ayers made a highly partisan political speech full of self congratulation and was countered by an equally contentious political attack from Mr Rowland Rees M.P.</p>

<p>Burra Parl. Club met last Tuesday, but there was no quorum. Mr. Ball, the Chief Secretary, moved that the club be dissolved in favour of a more general debating club if one were desired - religious questions, he felt, would have to be rigorously excluded. Party feeling had grown too strong for the original intention of the club to survive. Mr P. Lane suggested that without a quorum the club could not be dissolved and would have to die a natural death. Others concurred.</p>

<p>Eastern Road: Another delegation to the Commissioner of Public Works re. The Eastern Road. This time the Mayor, P. Lane, Captain Sanders (Cr.), T. Warnes (Chairman of District Council), Mr Duell &amp; Mr. Goodfellow favoured a road from Kooringa via Warne&rsquo;s Corner to World&rsquo;s End. Their route ran from the S.E. corner of Kooringa to SW corner of Baldina to the Hundred of Bright.</p>
<p>Warnes produced evidence of traffic flows for the week ending Feb. 19 showing: 121 loaded drays used the World&rsquo;s End Road &amp; 26 loaded drays used the Baldina Road.</p>
<p>Last week the World&rsquo;s End Road saw: 70 drays carrying 233 tons to Kooringa, 15 drays carrying 21 tons from Kooringa &amp; 7 drays carrying 18 tons to Redruth</p>
<p>The Baldina road saw merely: 6 drays carrying 13 tons 12 cwt from Kooringa &amp; 2 drays carrying 2 tons from Redruth</p>
<p>Captain Sanders said the Mine had received 4,400 tons of firewood in the last six months via their favoured route.</p>
<p>The minister agreed that their arguments were persuasive, but it was unusual for the minister to interfere with decisions of the road board.</p>

<p>FLOODS</p>
<p>On March 19 there was some flooding caused by a thunderstorm &amp; the weather failed to clear as it usually did and on each following day there was some rain until on Thursday 22 March it rained through the night becoming torrential on Friday from midday on.</p>
<p>Burra Creek burst its banks near the Unicorn Brewery and formed a second channel parallel to the main one. By 5.30pm it was level with the roadway in Bridge Street and then it broke through to form a channel between the bridge and the Bible Christian Church. Lower Thames Street was flooded as were most houses between Statton &amp; Henderson&rsquo;s [Market Square] and the Primitive Methodist Chapel. Fences and outbuildings between Thames Street and the creek were swept away. Houses on the western side of Paxton Square were flooded to 6-9&quot;.</p>
<p>At 7.OOpm the Bridge Street Bridge was swept away which allowed the water level to fall quickly by some 2-3&rsquo;. The bridge structure remained fixed to the eastern buttress and both ended up about a mile downstream.</p>
<p>At Aberdeen there was a sheet of water from Opie&rsquo;s Hotel to the new railway embankment. And water 2-3&rsquo; deep with a strong current was flowing up the road between the White Hart and the Aberdeen Hotels. Near Tiver&rsquo;s Corner it was 3&rsquo; deep and the Aberdeen Hotel was flooded to several inches. This stream re-entered the main creek between Orchards and the Burra Mill.</p>
<p>Ridgway&rsquo;s store was flooded as were most houses between Tiver&rsquo;s Corner and the White Hart Ford. The Bank of Australasia was surrounded, but not flooded.</p>
<p>Five to six feet of water flowed through the White Hart with damage estimated at £400-£500. The Bushman&rsquo;s Home was also flooded with damage put at about £200. The Mine Paddock was under water.</p>
<p>At Redruth the bridge was swaying with the pressure of water and police stopped traffic, fearing it would give way, but it survived.</p>
<p>There was considerable damage to the road to Hallett and the formation for the new railway was extensively damaged, especially near Hallett&rsquo;s Woolsheds. A mile south of Willogoleech [ee] the Waukaringa Mail Coach was overturned by water and two horses drowned, though all passengers escaped injury.</p>
<p>This was the worst flood for 30 years. [In view of the floods of 1851 this may not be strictly true.]</p>
<p>6 April 1877 Page 1.162</p>
<p>Burra cemetery: Ed. on a Burra peculiarity: the cemetery was locked at 4.00 p.m. Sunday to keep out goats and larrikins. He implied that in a treeless town without a recreation area this was the only place for pleasant walks under trees!</p>
<p>Entertainment: Burton &amp; Taylor&rsquo;s Circus on Sat. &amp; Monday well merited the good attendance.</p>
<p>Election: Voting in the Legislative Council elections was at the Institute for the first time - previously it had been at the old Burra Hotel which had become the Hospital. There was more interest than usual with 164 of the 406 enrolled exercising their right to vote.</p>
<p>Royal Mail: Tuesday’s Waukaringa mail will now include bags for intermediate stations so improving their service - viz. Mt Bryan Flat, Hallett, Yarcowie, Terowie, Parnaroo &amp; Paratoo.</p>
<p>Railways: Train times from Adelaide have been shortened by half an hour.</p>
<p>Copperhouse: Special services at the Primitive Methodist Church at Copperhouse, to aid the manse fund, saw 150 sit down to tea and raised £14</p>
<p>Entertainment: Friday 30 March. The Kooringa and Redruth Primitive Methodist Sunday-Schools Picnic in the Police Paddock at Redruth attracted some 250 children and about the same number of adults. The Burra Drum and Fife Band attended and there was a public tea. It raised about £30</p>
<p>Friday 30 March. United Friendly Societies&rsquo; Picnic in Austin&rsquo;s Paddock was held in excellent weather and recent rains left it free of dust, but dry underfoot. Attendance was only about 600 due in part to the distance from town and in part to some people&rsquo;s objections to such activity on Good Friday. The Burra Brass Band led a procession of the societies from the Institute at 10.00am, but disappointingly few attended - only 28 with a few more only as they passed Redruth and Aberdeen.</p>
<p>The following gives an interesting idea of the sort of sports held on such occasions.</p>

<p>Ladies&rsquo; Events</p>
<p>Apart from Ladies Blind Buff these were characteristically not reported.</p>
<p>There was also something called Jingling for Boys, as well as other unspecified activities.</p>
<p>70-80 people finished the day with a dinner in the Institute complete with toasts and speeches and entertainment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bear in mind that a labourer was earning between 6/- a day or 36/- (£1/16/-) a week and 7/- a day or £2/2/- a week</li>
</ul>
<p>BURRA MINE ACCIDENT</p>
<p>On Tuesday 3 April at 4.20am the second length of the main pumping rod at Morphett&rsquo;s Shaft broke 6-8 fathoms down and `the engine came indoors&rsquo;. The cast iron bob of the pump weighed 30 tons and on the break the inner end came down with great force in the pump house. The spring beams of sound timber 2'10&quot; deep and 14.5&quot; wide were smashed and the piston cracked in several places. The building had only recently been strengthened; otherwise considerable damage could have been expected to it as well. It was expected that repairs could be done on site.</p>
<p>Water at once began accumulating in the mine and all underground working had to be suspended. The pump will be out of action `for some considerable time&rsquo;</p>
<p>6 April 1877 Page 1.163</p>
<p>Entertainment: Sunday 3 April. Burra Races held on the Mine Paddock. Good weather and the Burra Brass Band and Orchestra of Burton &amp; Taylor&rsquo;s Grand United Circus were in attendance. There were half a dozen races with the Burra Handicap over 2 miles as the main event. 1st prize was 50 sovereigns. [i.e. 50 gold £1 coins]</p>
<p>Reported as a good day with a well managed meeting on a good course. The report is quite detailed.</p>
<p>Sunday 3 April. Report too on the Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday-School Anniversary</p>
<p>Eastern Road: Midland Road Board refused money to rebuild the Kooringa Bridge because of its `not being on a main line of road.&rsquo; The council also had more discussion on the NW Bend road. The Council decided to appeal to the Commissioner of Public Works for funds for a Kooringa Bridge.</p>
<p>Footpaths: Cr. Roberts drew attention to the virtual complete lack of footpaths in the town and especially to the poor approaches to places of worship.</p>
<p>13 April 1877, Page 1.166</p>
<p>Hallett railway: Ed. again on the drainage problems.</p>
<p>With a new Kooringa bridge estimated to cost £1,500-£2,000 the Ed. was of the opinion that the Council should not hurry to a commitment. It was too much for local rates and needed a public meeting for discussion before any decision, which in any case should not proceed on the NW Bend road. (Eastern Road.) If the old road were taken the bridge would be on a main road and the Midland Road Board would be responsible, but if the new line via Redruth and Diprose Creek were taken it would not!</p>
<p>Coaches: E.F. Opie is new contractor for the N-E Mail. The 1st trip on 6 April had 13 passengers. There was a near accident at Terowie when the horses made a rush before being coupled up, but fortunately the driver was restrained as they dashed off.</p>
<p>13 April 1877, Page 1.167</p>
<p>Crime: Petty theft was becoming a problem with a series of losses of fowls, clothing from lines and small items from around outside of houses.</p>
<p>A small child was attacked by a vicious dog.</p>
<p>Crime: A horse was stolen from the Miners&rsquo; Arms; the thief also breaking into the stables to get the blanket, saddle etc.</p>
<p>Burra School: good progress by Sara &amp; Dunstan. A third of the building is ready for the roof and the rest will be in a month.</p>
<p>THE BURRA MINE ACCIDENT</p>
<p>Pumping was able to be resumed at 5.30pm on Tuesday. [A little over a week after the accident] Some underground work is now possible, but not all workers are yet back as water had risen to the 40 fathom level. At 1,700 gallons per minute a week or two will clear the main shaft and perhaps 3-4 weeks to totally clear the lower levels.</p>
<p>Hallett railway: Aberdeen Mill Underpass. 20 people attended a meeting at the Institute to discuss the motion `That an under crossing through the railway embankment between the Bon Accord Hotel and Messrs J. &amp; E. Butterworth&rsquo;s mill is absolutely necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The problems with a level crossing were thought great, but the site of the one proposed was on a steep incline and was made worse because the traffic here would be mainly heavy vehicles from the goods station and in addition to the slope there was a sharp turn. They wanted an underpass like the one at Bowden. Deputation was chosen to see the Commissioner of Public Works.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital: Edward Lipsett wrote a letter complaining of insufficient staff at the hospital.</p>

<p>Burra Mine: - Captain Sanders reports all water clear of mine and all underground work resumed on 19 April. The last 6 months produced 803 tons at an av. 27% copper.</p>
<p>Sales raised £26,227 and rents bought in £2959 [total £29,186], but expenses were £51,101 to give a deficit of £2,267 [This doesn&rsquo;t seem to add up, but that&rsquo;s what it says.]</p>
<p>300 men and boys employed.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital: Ed. on the hospital with a description of the layout in some detail.</p>
<p>Report by H. Howitt on the staffing of the hospital - defending the arrangements in place.</p>
<p>Temperance Society Meeting addressed by Dr. Brummitt, a new arrival, and a total abstainer</p>
<p>Burra Corporation</p>
<p>Capt. Sanders in the chair said that the Bridge St Bridge had long been inconvenient and that the replacement should be relocated.</p>
<p>Mr Morris agreed and said general feeling favoured one in line with Commercial St</p>
<p>He alleged 80% of population agreed. The creek there was wider and the flow in flood therefore less violent. It needed the purchase of land from Messrs Statton &amp; Henderson on the west bank, while the east side approach offered no difficulty. He thought that 30&rsquo; could be obtained with no difficulty, but doubted that was enough. (Compulsory acquisition was not available as it was not a main road)</p>
<p>Cr. Snell thought they would sell 40'</p>
<p>Morris thought 50&rsquo; desirable and 40&rsquo; the minimum.</p>
<p>The Corporation resolved to take steps to acquire the land.</p>
<p>On being approached the owners agreed to sell provided it was S of the Nth post of their entrance from Market Square. In return they wanted 100&rsquo; of the land now set aside for a road +£488/15l- cash for a piece of land 40&rsquo; wide.</p>
<p>Council thought this far too high and decided merely to `receive&rsquo; the letter.</p>
<p>There was a request for a footbridge at the site of the old bridge.</p>
<p>Cr. Sanders said the remnant of the old bridge contained usable timbers 31&rsquo; long.</p>
<p>Lipsett &amp; Sanders moved that the new footbridge be made from material salvaged from the old bridge. Agreed.</p>

<p>Entertainment: Advt. &ldquo;Great European Star Combination&rdquo; at the Institute 28th &amp; 30th - Aerial act by `Airec&rsquo; plus &ldquo;Operatic, Serio-Comic, and Characteristic Songs and Dances&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dutch and Negro Impersonations, Clog Dances, and Burlesque Sketches&rdquo; Seats 3/-, 2/- &amp; 1/</p>
<p>Agriculture: Co. Burra agriculture for 1876-77. 14,778 acres sown to wheat of which 10,404 acres were reaped with 3,577 cut as hay &amp; rest lost. The yield was 52,092 bushels at av. 5 bushels per acre.</p>
<p>Cf. previous season 13,109 acres yielded 140,861 bushels at an av. 10 bushels 45 lb/ acre</p>
<p>Difference due to drought. Areas getting over 5 bushels should make a profit, though not a great one. Prices were up &amp; a 7 bushel crop was as profitable as an 8.5 bushel one the previous season. The drought had hit pastoralists worse.</p>
<p>Elections: Ed. was on `The Late Elections&rsquo; [for the Legislative Council]</p>
<p>Russia has declared war on Turkey</p>
<p>Springbank Primitive Methodist Chapel reopened 22 &amp; 23 April after renovations costing £40. New iron roof &amp; walls &amp; ceiling repaired and whitewashed. The cost was raised in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>A lamp exploded in the Miners&rsquo; Arms billiard room and scattered itself and fuel over a table, but it was after the lights were out at night and no fire resulted.</p>
<p>Coaches: Kerr Bros. Kooringa has made 2 new mail coaches for E.F. Opie. Believed to be the first built in the town. To American designs - the lightest compatible with strength and durability</p>
<p>Comfortably seat 10. Bodies painted vermilion with carriage part and wheels in yellow. The panels adorned with American arms - stars &amp; stripes surmounted by an eagle.</p>
<p>The Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society held an entertainment in connection with St Josephs on 19 April of songs and glees &amp; though of good standard it was not very well attended.</p>
<p>27 April 1877, Page 1 175</p>
<p>Bridge: The footbridge at Bridge St has been erected</p>
<p>Burra Hospital: Lipsett again writes re inadequate staff at hospital (sparked by the `escape&rsquo; of a typhoid sufferer who took himself to the Miners&rsquo; Arms and had to be returned - more details in paper)</p>
<p>Working Conditions: Letter to Ed. promoting closure of shops on Saturday at 6pm for sake of workers and as little business if done.</p>
<p>W.R. Ridgway appealed in court at Redruth against the Corporation Assessment of the Burra Burra Mine which was assessed at £573/15/-; a decrease from £600 under the District Council. Judgement upheld his objection to some degree and set the value at £650.</p>
<p>Eastern Road: Midland Road board received a direction from Commissioner of Public Works directing them to construct the road from Kooringa to NW Bend as provided in the Act and not the deviation via Aberdeen.</p>
<p>[The quibble then became one over the word versus the spirit of the Act with the Board believing they fulfilled the spirit. There was also debate over whether there really was a difference between Aberdeen and Kooringa as few people outside those towns knew them as separate and thought of the place as Burra.]</p>
<p>The board decided not to respond immediately, but to seek further legal advice as the instruction seemed based on a technicality. They were inclined to stick to their position - after all why have a Board if the minister could issue orders overturning the decisions based on actual inspection and on the spot surveys.</p>

<p>Coaches: E.F. Opie&rsquo;s coaches now run once a week Burra to Bimbowrie [near Outalpa - north of Olary on the Broken Hill road] and twice a week Burra to Waukaringa, departing 2pm Tuesday &amp; Friday and the return coaches arrive Tuesday &amp; Friday at 4pm in time to connect with the last Adelaide train.

<p>Kooringa Bridge: Commissioner of Public Works writes to say that the new bridge at Kooringa will be funded in the next year&rsquo;s estimates &amp; that the Council need take no steps to acquire land as that will be done by either the Govt. or the Midland Roads Board.</p>
<p>Bridge: The cost of the new footbridge at Bridge Street c.£12/10/- with construction c. £9 and transport of materials from the old bridge c.£3/11/-. Once work on it is quite finished the footbridge at the Pig and Whistle will be restored.</p>

<p>Burra Corp. Ed. summary of the rates fiasco.</p>
<p>The 1st town council declared a rate without complying with some technical formalities which resulted in a round-robin protest stating that those signing felt that the rate was unenforceable. The council took offence and didn&rsquo;t reply. The protesters went to the Supreme Court and the rate was quashed. A new rate was then declared in April 1877 for the year ending 31 August 1877. The opposition then declared it would only be legal if it ran till 31 December 1877. The Council declined as this would cause them to lose £120 in Govt. subsidy on work done before 31 Dec. 1876. The opposition then got legal advice that the rate was again unenforceable. The Council got contrary legal advice. They then resolved to go to the local court for resolution, but also there was a public meeting in May at which nothing was resolved; a motion to approve the Council action being lost by one vote. The Editor expressed concern at the damage being done to the town regardless of which legal view prevailed in the end. The paper in fact was fairly even-handed in its condemnation of both parties. [There had also been a number of appeals against the valuation/assessment process.]</p>
<p>There was a detailed report of the public meeting: 2.5 columns on p.187 &amp; 3 on p.188.</p>
<p>Hallett railway: There was a meeting at Mt Bryan to protest the closure of several roads by the new railway.</p>
<p>Eastern Road: A public meeting also debated the reaction of the Midland Road Board in not following the instruction of the minister.</p>

<p>Burra Young Men&rsquo;s United Association; `The Creation'</p>
<p>Redruth Wesleyans had a social night of songs and recitation to aid the Schoolroom debt.</p>
<p>Bridge: There was a report that there had been half a dozen accidents in a week at the footbridge behind the Miners&rsquo; Arms. In the most serious Mr. W. Parker fell on a broken bottle and almost severed two fingers. Several muddy baptisms were also reported. [The descriptions suggest a single plank without handrail and of course without any lighting at night.] Also a letter in support of same from W. Parker saying he was now unable to work for 5 or 6 weeks.</p>
<p>St Joseph&rsquo;s was running an Art Union</p>
<p>Hallett railway; the piles for the road underpass had been driven and they were now driving those for the Burra Creek Bridge.</p>
<p>Mine accident; William Ryan&rsquo;s right forearm crushed under a truck. A child&rsquo;s fingers caught in machine cogs.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital: At last the conveyance of the hospital from SAMA to the Corporation was signed.</p>
<p>25 May 1877, Page 1.190</p>
<p>Defence: The volunteer movement in SA was under way with c.800 men signed up, mainly in Adelaide. The Govt. plan was for a force of 1000. Adelaide to have 100 artillerymen, 420 infantry rifles and 60 mounted rifles. Wallaroo; 80 infantry riflemen and 40 artillerymen. Five other country areas to have 60 infantry riflemen each, i.e. Gawler, Kapunda, Burra, Saddleworth/Clare &amp; Goolwal/Strathalbyn. At Burra there was a large attendance at a meeting on 15 May at which over 70 signatures were obtained and a committee formed to formalise a list for transmission to headquarters.</p>
<p>Defence: Ed. favouring a larger defence force and allowing for cavalry outside of Adelaide too. Reports that a supply of Martini-Henri rifles has been dispatched from UK.</p>
<p>Burra Young Men&rsquo;s United Association: `Which has most benefited mankind Telegraphy or Railways.'</p>
<p>Entertainment: Thursday 24 May; the Queen&rsquo;s Birthday holiday passed with no amusements in town except `the Anglican Church pinic&rsquo; [sic]</p>
<p>Successful social musical evening of song and recitation at the Redruth Wesleyan Schoolroom.</p>
<p>Eastern Road: Deputation to the Commissioner of Public works seeking again that the road to Baldina go over Breakneck hill as at present and not down Diprose Creek as the Board wanted. Deputation suggested a compromise in which would use the district road up close to the junction of Rocky Creek with Diprose Creek and then across Nankivell&rsquo;s Gully to the `saddle&rsquo; (which would leave the hill out) and on to the district road again at the stock reserve.</p>
<p>Bible Christian Church anniversary, Kooringa. The form of such celebrations was as follows: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening Services on Sunday. (Perhaps only two of these at small chapels) On Monday a tea in the schoolroom and a public meeting in the church afterwards with a report on the year&rsquo;s activities with speakers, prayers and songs. In this case they reported the library had c.500 volumes.</p>

<p>Editorial on the Eastern Road - the editor felt that the partisan feeling on the subject was not so much about the road as about; <code>the general partisan feeling which prevails in the town' and which is used as </code>a kind of &ldquo;stock piece&rdquo; to fill up a gap when there is nothing else to fight about.'</p>
<p>Douglas: This township of in the H. of Baldina has been surveyed and named and sale of allotments will take place at the Lands Office in Adelaide on 28 June 1877.</p>
<p>The report on the Redruth Wesleyan anniversary gives some details on the history of the church buildings and their costs.</p>
<p>1 June 1877, Page 1 195</p>
<p>Speaking at the Redruth Wesleyan anniversary Dr. Brummitt, a newcomer from England, pointed out that anniversaries in UK were once a year, but in SA some congregations managed to have them up to four times a year and this one fell 2 years 8 months after foundation! He was concerned about the lack of young men in the church compared with the situation in UK.</p>

<p>Letter to Ed.</p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>To say that there is not a lot of low-lived thieves prowling about the neighbourhood of Redruth would be something untrue. Last night at about half past eight, as my daughter went out the back door to bring in clothes from the line, one of these midnight marauders suddenly made a bolt from under the line, and in his haste tumbled down at the end of the house. The girl immediately told me. I at once rushed for my revolver, but true to his colours, when I went out he was non est. I would caution him not to make his appearance there again, or I will shoot him down like a dog.</p>
<p>I am, Sir &amp; c., REVOLVER Redruth, May 31, 1877.</p>
<p>Roads: The main road to Mount Bryan was reported in a bad state. However much stone was added in summer, the winter rains undermined the filling. A single 6-8 ton wagon with 26 horses leaves tracks deep enough to capsize any ordinary vehicle.</p>

<p>Hallett Railway: the embankment near Hillside being remade after March&rsquo;s floods. The piles are in place at the Burra Creek and the embankment from there to the station is under construction. Cr Roberts said of the temporary iron buildings erected by the Govt. for the immigrant workers on the railway that they were &ldquo;positively indecent, as only a partial partition separated two families, and at the ridge there was four inches left open which rendered the buildings very cold.&rdquo; Cr Sanders responded [apparently without intended irony] that &ldquo;they were no worse than Paxton Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>P. Lane (Mayor) said that if a migrant paid a visit &ldquo;to the Eastern Plains for a few months he would consider him well off to get equally good quarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burra Corp. The lawyer W.H. Bundey, acting as an arbitrator in the matter of the rate assessment, gave the following opinion:</p>
<p>The problem stems from Part XIII, clause 151, of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1861. This says that a declaration of rents profits and receipts estimated for the year and of the proposed outlay and expenditure for the same shall be published in the Govt. Gazette on or before 1 Sept. each year. Clause 152 says that in order to raise the funds above the council may order assessments etc. to be made. Clause 164 allows the declaration of a rate, but not one over 1/without the ratepayers&rsquo; consent.</p>
<p>The publication of these estimates can only be for the ratepayers&rsquo; information as the council itself doesn&rsquo;t need the publication. The word `shall&rsquo; in clause 151 means that publication is essential for the validity of the assessments and rates to be imposed. Other corporations have also failed to do so at some time (Adelaide, Kensington &amp; Norwood, Gawler, Glenelg, Port Adelaide, and Brighton.) They have had to resort to getting a validating clause from parliament.</p>
<p>Because the year referred to in the relevant clauses is a calendar year, it must run from 1 Jan. to 31 Dec. The Corporation may be in error in making the rate retrospective in part, but that is a moot point.</p>
<p>On balance the dissenters, upon payment of the 1/- in the £ should be free of any other payment until the year 1878 and while they could take the matter further they would seem to suffer no disadvantage if they were to accept that the payment runs to 31 Dec. 1877 and if the Corporation does so too, as the parties agreed at the start of this arbitration.</p>

<p>Defence: Ed. on the Volunteer Force. When the actual time for enrolment came only 13 actually came forward, though initially 70 names were given. Several reasons are possible, including the lack of cavalry and not knowing who the officers would be, and recent dismissals of mine workers made their staying in the town uncertain, but there were also less creditable reasons. Gawler and Kapunda had the required numbers. Ed. clearly disgusted.</p>

<p>Railways: On 14 June the evening passenger to Adelaide ran over a horse between Tarlee and Stockport, shredding the animal and breaking a spring, but it failed to stop!

<p>On 22 June Hon. John Colton, Commissioner of Public Works visited the area with his secretary, &amp; Chairman of the Midland Road Board &amp; the Board&rsquo;s Superintendent-Surveyor, to decide the vexed question. They were met by P. Lane (Mayor), &amp; Messrs Butterworth, Ridgway, Stewart, Preece, Tiver &amp; others. After a lunch with councillors at the Commercial Hotel they proceeded to the junction of the Bright and Baldina Roads, 50 or 60 chains short of the proposed deviation. They proceeded on foot as far as Nankivell’s where they rejoined their vehicles and were driven to the railway station by way of the old road via the Smelting Works. To fill in an hour they visited the Burra-Hallett railway works before leaving by the evening train.</p>

Subsequent information found an intact pistol, though attempts had been made to destroy it with an axe. Mrs Colley had been drunk when visiting the hospital and at the inquest.</p>

<p>Eastern Road. Ed. We believe in the resolution of this issue that has been made `the main road should run from Kooringa to Aberdeen, thence over the Redruth Bridge and via the Smelting Works to the junction of the Baldina and Bright roads; that a road from Kooringa via the present route and connected with the main road at Nankivell&rsquo;s Gully, should be constructed by the Government, but the maintenance would have to be borne by the Corporation and the District Council.&rsquo; This seemed a fair result, but the £500 grant from the Midland Road Board for the Kooringa road is plainly inadequate, placing too great a strain on the local councils.</p>
<p>Commercial Hotel. A small fire in bedroom curtains at the hotel was extinguished without serious damage.</p>
<p>St Mary&rsquo;s. Subscriptions for the new church, which is of excellent design, are coming in.

<p>Hallett Railway. Ed. claims that Lovell&rsquo;s report on the flood damage is something of a whitewash effort. Says 9 inch culverts were placed where 5 foot ones were needed and that the claim that no real knowledge of conditions was available was nonsense. Firewood Creek is 81 feet wide and a 40 foot bridge was ordered. Much of the damage was because no culverts were in place as they wanted to use the embankment during construction and insert the culverts later. There was even the remarkable suggestion that the flood was used to determine where the culverts would be needed! Ed. said much more than 40 chains were damaged, but perhaps that was the totally destroyed section. The damage bill would seem to be understated. Work is now being pursued with vigour and there is some hope that part of the line might be ready for the coming harvest season.</p>

<p>World&rsquo;s End P.O. is little used as it is out of the way, but will doubtless soon move to the new township [Lapford] which has just been surveyed 14 miles from Kooringa near the Burra Creek.</p>
<p>At World&rsquo;s End the creek is clean and fresh with beautiful gums. Crops from here on were better.</p>
<p>At Spring Hut Creek there was good water at 2 feet all year and several settlers use this resource in summer.</p>
<p>There was ripe oats here in sheaves.</p>
<p>Emu Flat in H. of English is 3 miles by 15 miles and has clumps of mallee, gums and pine.</p>
<p>Brady Creek empties onto it and there is a lagoon which last winter extended to 200 acres and attracted ducks.</p>
<p>This area had beautiful wheat paddocks.</p>
<p>On the north side of the flat is Robertstown.</p>
<p>Mr J. Roberts, formerly of Kooringa has a good stock of goods and runs the P.O. with mail 3 times a week to Marrabel.</p>
<p>There is a blacksmith and wheelwright, but as yet no hotel.</p>
<p>The German chapel has all services in German and the small Bible Christian Chapel on the western side of the plain is connected with Kapunda Station, but is now closed.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts has agreed to let Primitive Methodist services be held in his house until a chapel is built.</p>
<p>Redruth Bridge. The Midland Road Board surveyor found rotten planks and ribs and while no immediate danger, it needs repair and a warning sign should be erected in the meantime. It should be replaced with an iron bridge of the bow string type. The present span is 7I'3&quot; and locals say this is insufficient in floods and causes water to build up behind it.</p>

<p>Advt. First Burra Show; 12 September at the E. &amp; A.C. Co.&rsquo;s Smelting Works.</p>
<p>Ed. on Railways. The traffic manager, Mr Pendleton is unsatisfactory. The freight charges are too high. It costs more to get an item from Adelaide to Burra than from England to Port Adelaide. And the rates have just increased 20%! Wheat that was going at 8d a bushel will now cost 9.5d <code>On copper mining in this district the new tariff will have a very injurious effect' </code>The Burra Burra Mines have been carried on at a loss for some time now, and but for a belief that deeper sinking would develop payable lode no doubt the workings would have been discontinued before now.&rsquo; The North West Bend Railway (Morgan) will not get much of the river trade with such rates as Victoria charges very low rates to encourage the use of the Echuca line.</p>
<p>There was a meeting at Riverton protesting the new tariff and a petition started there has come to Burra and been circulated for signatures.</p>
<p>Lapford. Last week&rsquo;s Govt. Gazette announced the sale of allotments in this new town at World&rsquo;s End, H. of Bright, on 19 Sept.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines. Captain Sanders reports Morphett&rsquo;s Shaft has sunk a further 2 fathoms 2 feet and should reach 100 fathoms this month. The 85 north has been extended on Kingston&rsquo;s lode and has been productive, but Sander&rsquo;s Lode has not been of sufficient value to justify driving. Open cut work continues as usual and all machinery is working well.</p>
<p>Burra Corp. The Commissioner of Public Works replies in the negative to the request for more money for the Kooringa road to Nankivell’s Gully.</p>
<p>The public having donated £3111/b, it was resolved to call tenders for the footbridge at the White Hart Ford.</p>
<p>Statton and Henderson offered to transfer the land needed for the approach to the Kingston St Bridge for nothing if the Corp. would fill the 100 feet of land to be given in exchange, to the height of their existing premises and build a retaining wall. The Corp. agreed to this offer.</p>

<p>Trip to the Murray. From a correspondent.</p>
<p>Crops east of Baldina were very bad and many will not be worth harvesting. 640 acre properties here are not large enough as a combination of pastoralism and grain is needed. Feed for animals is OK, The wharves at North West Bend [Morgan] are taking shape. . The town is yet to be surveyed, but already some temporary businesses have appeared. Mr Symonds has a hotel with excellent accommodation. Care to keep activities above flood level will be needed. Blanchetown was quiet.</p>
<p>First Burra Show. Wed. 12 Sept, in the yards of the English &amp; Australian Copper Co. The weather was poor with a bitterly cold wind and showers, but at least 1000 people turned out. There was a display of horses, sheep and implements in one yard and in the building there were vegetables, dairy produce, dogs, poultry, and a display of photographs by Messrs. Dobson of the Temple of Light, Adelaide. Mr C. Oppermann had a display of stuffed birds. A second yard held cattle. There were also Cheap Jack stalls and other games including twos-and-threes. There were refreshments with tea; coffee and `stronger liquors&rsquo;. The prize list ran for about 2.5 columns.</p>

<p>Trip to Robertstown. `A Farmer&rsquo; challenged the correspondent&rsquo;s version of the trip, claiming the crops are better than stated and that the World&rsquo;s End P.O. is less than a quarter mile from the main road and receives 60-70 letters a month and 30-40 newspapers. Spring Hut water is brackish and the oats cited were rye. [The correspondent replied that it had rained since: his trip and crops had undoubtedly picked up and he could but rely on local reports of the water quality.]</p>

<p>First Burra Show. Ed. comment was that it had a few problems, but generally went very well, especially considering that the organisation was only about 6-7 weeks old. The purchase of some land for the future shows is seen as a priority. Three sites are suggested. Cemetery Flat, between the school and Paxton Square, and between Redruth and Hampton</p>

<p>Burra Young Men&rsquo;s United Assoc. Readings and Recitations.</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines. [This announcement on page 3 of the paper has no headline and runs for about 10cm of one column!]</p>
<p>`In consequence of the low state of the copper market the Directors of the Burra Burra Mines have decided to temporarily suspend all operations, and the workings will be stopped on Saturday, September 29. A few men will be kept on for a few days in order to get the pumping machinery in a position to start again as soon as the copper market rises.'</p>
<p>This will reduce money in the town by c. £30,000 annually. Wages at present are about £2,000 monthly and firewood over £500 a month. 300 men and boys will be thrown out of work. We hope some relief will come from railway construction and work on the Eastern Road.</p>
<p>Accidents on 18 Sept.</p>
<p>E.F. Opie was thrown from his horse and sprained a wrist.</p>
<p>J. Opie with the Waukaringa Mail lost a swingletree near the National Bank causing the leading horse to bolt. The coach ran into J.W. White&rsquo;s residence smashing the pole. There were no injuries.</p>
<p>Mr Rains galloped into a spring cart just north of White&rsquo;s residence and suffered bruising and a fractured leg. The horse was probably ruined and the cart damaged.</p>
<p>Mr J.F. Duff was driving a pair of horses when they bolted up Commercial St and were stopped eventually some way along the Sod Hut Road. He turned them, but they bolted again at the bridge in Commercial St and negotiated Market Square at a great rate before again being stopped without damage. The horse of F. Bromley, butcher, became unmanageable near the Aberdeen Hotel and ran into W.H. Martin&rsquo;s buggy, breaking the points off both shafts and slightly hurting his horse.</p>
<p>Son of Mr T. Richardson of the Miners&rsquo; Arms was thrown from his horse and stunned.</p>
<p>And on Friday Dr Dashwood&rsquo;s horse bolted at the Mine Bridge, went up hill at White&rsquo;s house and he was knocked off by the clothes line.</p>
<p>Burra Corp. The bill to validate the council&rsquo;s rates finally passed the third reading in the House of Assembly &amp; now just waits Vice-Regal assent.</p>
<p>District Council of Burra. Letter to Ed. complaining about cronyism in the appointment of a friend, J.D. Cave, of the president, Mr T. Warnes, to position of Overseer of Works at £70 per year.</p>
<p>Railways. Burra meeting opposing the new railway tariffs on 18 Sept. 20 present chaired by the Mayor, Mr P. Lane. A deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works on Wed got him to agree to lower the charges for copper ore, wood and building stone, but not on wool or wheat.</p>
<p>Kapunda Mine. The rail tariffs had an effect here too when in addition to low copper prices. Capt. Osborne has stopped one pump and put the pull engine on half time, allowing the water to rise from the 80 to the 70 fathom level. About 20 jobs will have to go.</p>

<p>Burra Young Men&rsquo;s United Assoc. `Popular Delusions'</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines Ed. The outlook for the town is `not very promising&rsquo; There is some hope for activity from the Burra-Hallett railway, but once that is open the transfer of the railhead will actually take business away from the town. In the long run the Ed. felt this loss could be more serious than the mine closure. There would be the end of the arrival and departure of the mail coaches and of many of the bullock- and other teams that use the station.</p>
<p>At least the coming harvest is better than first feared as a result of recent rains. Serious as it is the loss of the mine cannot be as severe now as it was when only pastoralism was carried on round about. The Ed. was still hopeful that the closure was temporary.</p>

<p>Ed. Burra is most unsightly, being almost treeless and flowerless. There is a need to divest the town of `its unenviable attribute of almost peerless ugliness&rsquo; Trees are needed everywhere. Compare with the eastern side of Gawler where tree planting has done so much.</p>
<p>There is also the need for a recreation ground. The few earlier stirrings having come to nothing.</p>
<p>The railway station is very inconveniently located; it could at least be moved closer to Sara &amp; Dunstan&rsquo;s by almost a quarter of a mile (i.e. near the Bon Accord crossing.</p>

<p>Local Industry. Mr W. Parker of Aberdeen has started making a tombfence. Not as elaborate as some, but compares favourably.</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine. Many rumours, but most unfounded. The fact is that the pumps will stop within the next week and all operations will then be discontinued. All surplus property, horses etc. will then be sold, but sufficient plant will be retained to enable a restart at some point in the future. A general meeting of shareholders that had been adjourned will resume on 17 November when some more answers are expected.</p>

<p>2 November 1877 Page 2.282</p>
<p>Hallett Railway Debate continues over Mt Bryan Railway Station location. Summary so far:</p>
<p>(1) First site chosen was Sec. 75 near Mr Ullmann&rsquo;s house on Mt Bryan Flat, about midway from Burra to Hallett.</p>
<p>(2) Objectors convinced the Commissioner of Public Works to change to the southern portion of the travelling stock route near Gumbowie [only about 6 miles south of Hallett]</p>
<p>(3) Another deputation then sought to have the first decision reinstated. The Commissioner says he wants to accommodate the majority so the debate continues.</p>
<p>Ed. favours a site near junction of Main North Road and the road from Mt Bryan East; near the District Council Chambers as most traffic will come from the east. This site may be subject to flooding and if that can&rsquo;t readily be rectified then a site on Sec. 75 is the better choice remaining. It would suit Mt Bryan East and Banbury while the northern area towards Hallett is sheep country and the suggested location there is too near the Hallett terminus.</p>
<p>A sensible alternative would be to realise that with relatively little traffic a loading platform at both sites without a proper (i.e. staffed] station might be best of all.</p>
<p>Some rail laying began at the Burra end on 29 Oct.</p>
<p>Pleuro-pneumonia. There has been an assurance that affected cattle are not passing through the Burra slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>Burra Young Men&rsquo;s United Assoc. held a &lsquo;sociable&rsquo; at Kooringa Wesleyan Sunday School on 7 Nov. A number of tables were set out with different activities and participants moved around at leisure. The activities included: - 3 microscopes, 2 galvanic batteries, 3 sets of parlour croquet, a zootrope [or zoetrope - a cylinder open at top with slits in the side and animals etc. painted on the inner surface so that when the cylinder rotates and the pictures are viewed through the slots, the pictures appear to move.] lotto, draughts, a working model steam engine, 2 music boxes, 5 stereoscopes, a graphoscope [an apparatus with a magnifying glass arranged to enable comfortable viewing of engravings, photographs etc.] conversation cards, chess, a geographic lottery and photographs.

<p>40 people attended a meeting at Mt Bryan to discuss the location of the station. It was moved that its location revert to the original decision; i.e. Sec. 75. An amendment moved that it be at the travelling stock road. After discussion the amendment was lost 12 to 24 and the motion passed 22 to 12. A memorial reflecting this has been sent to the government.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines. On Tuesday and Wednesday next will be performed nearly the last act in the drama of the `knocking&rsquo; of the Burra Mines. Sale of all surplus plant and equipment. The business in town is depressed, but the prospects for harvest are good. The cessation of pumping has caused a problem of water supply for livestock. Previously the creek at Redruth and Aberdeen was supplied by the pumping and livestock depended upon it. Now there is a need for water as the creek dries up. The Mayor, in response to an application from a group of ratepayers, has called a meeting for Tuesday afternoon (20 Nov.) to consider the problem. A bathing place is also needed. The Mine Pool was previously available and much used in summer months, but now it is very low and will not be replenished until the mines begin working again.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital. On Monday afternoon Thomas Park&rsquo;s young daughters held a children&rsquo;s bazaar in F.W. Moody&rsquo;s auction mart and raised £1112/- for the hospital.</p>

<p>Burra Burra Mines. At the shareholders&rsquo; meeting on 12 November chaired by G. S. Kingston it was revealed that losses in the last five years were £82.000 and since 1875, when Arthur Blyth proposed winding up the company, they had been £23,730. It was expected the sale of surplus equipment etc. would virtually liquidate all outstanding liabilities and any small balance outstanding could be met from income from property. Mr Tomkinson complained of the incompetence implicit in the continued operations over the last few years and Sir Henry Ayers defended the actions of the directors in that period. The meeting then adjourned for a month to allow directors to visit the mine and report back.</p>

<p>White Hart Ford Footbridge has almost been finished.</p>
<p>A Footbridge near the Catholic School is now repaired.</p>
<p>Burra Corp. is to complain to the Commissioner about the removal of Constable Wilson from Kooringa to Redruth. As they paid half his salary, they felt they should have some say in the move of such a popular officer. They were supported by a deputation led by Rev. Howitt aided by Thomas Drew.</p>
<p>W. Brooks waited on the Corp. asking that East St Hampton be placed on Corp. maps.</p>
<p>Redruth Wesleyan Sunday School celebrated its 21st anniversary on 4 November with a sports day on Friday 9 November.</p>
<p>Rabbits. On 10 November there was a public meeting at the Racecourse Hotel, Copperhouse, to consider the DC’s adoption of a rabbit rate. About 20 ratepayers attended with H. Woodgate in the chair. They resolved that Copperhouse ratepayers should not pay the rate, there being few rabbits there. They also wanted the resignation from Council of Messrs Stevens, Watts and Warnes and would take their objections to the Government if ignored by Council.</p>
<p>St Joseph’s anniversary celebrations on 11 &amp; 12 November were well attended.</p>

<p>Water. Editorial on the meeting at Orchard’s (Aberdeen) Hotel on Wednesday to discuss the water crisis in Aberdeen and Redruth. The main need is for water for cattle and horses which were well supplied while the mine pumps kept the creek full. The failure of the water supply is due to the Burra Burra and Bon Accord Mines which lowered the water table and caused local wells to go dry. People then relied on water pumped from the mines. Secondly the question of leasehold properties (Kooringa) prevented the construction of tanks.</p>
<p>White Hart Ford Footbridge has been completed.</p>
<p>Agriculture. The season’s wheat is beginning to arrive in Burra.</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines. The sale on Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Thursday went quite well and realised almost £5,000.</p>

<p>Bon Accord Mine. Captain Sanders forwards to the Yorke&rsquo;s Peninsula Co, a report on the state of the lodes in the closed Burra Burra Mine suggesting that they might continue into the Bon Accord property and predicting good results if the Bon Accord workings were sunk 30 fathoms deeper - as good as were obtainable in the Burra Burra Mine at a depth of 100 fathoms.</p>
<p>23 November 1877 Page 2.295</p>
<p>Hallett Railway. A deputation from Mount Bryan waited on the Commissioner of Public Works about the siting of the Mt Bryan Railway Station. It wanted the station on Sec. 75 and presented a petition of c.80 signatures. The commissioner now proposes to visit the area personally.</p>
<p>Hallett Telegraph. The deputation from Mt Bryan then went to the Minister of Education to present a memorial on the need for a telegraph line to Hallett.</p>
<p>Letter to Ed. about the dangerous unfenced creek between the Redruth Police Station and the Burra Creek.</p>
<p>Water Supply. Report of the public meeting held at Orchard&rsquo;s Hotel 21 -Nov. concerning the water supply at Redruth and Aberdeen. A. Bartholomaeus in the chair. B. Butterworth moved `That a supply of water is absolutely necessary&rsquo; Not only needed for normal horses and cattle, but many teams associated with the harvest will be demanding water. Aberdeen had only two wells (+ Mr Butterworth&rsquo;s which could serve only the mill) Warning that Kooringa will soon also be in difficulties. Carried unanimously.</p>
<p>W.R. Ridgway explained why the meeting was not on Tuesday as called by the mayor - too short notice. Then moved `That in the event of the Government giving a favourable reply, a memorial be prepared and forwarded to Messrs Rees and Rounsevell for presentation to the Government, urging them to take steps to have water mains laid on from the Bon Accord Shaft, via Morehead Street, to the Bank of Australasia; thence southward as far as Opie&rsquo;s Hotel and northward as far as the White Hart Hotel, with a view to further extension when considered necessary and practicable.&rsquo; W. Woollacott wanted Kooringa included.</p>
<p>There was an engine ready to do the pumping. Mr Dawson wanted water immediately via a trough at the station gate filled by tapping the government main from the Bon Accord shaft. This could be done for about £IQ. Last summer the Bon Accord Hotel had apparently got a pipe from the government scheme and paid 6/- per 1,000 gallons. After some debate Mr Ridgway withdrew his motion so that one by Mr Rosman for the placement of a trough immediately could be put. It passed unanimously.</p>
<p>Mr Ridgway&rsquo;s motion was then put and carried unanimously. A committee was formed to get donations for the trough work and also to prepare a memorial to be sent to the government etc. (A. Bartholomaeus, B. Butterworth, Dawson, Preece, &amp; W.R. Ridgway)</p>
<p>Defence: Volunteer Company. All hopes for a volunteer company in Burra died last week when a proclamation in the Govt. Gazette removed Burra and Wallaroo from the list of brigades.</p>
<p>Mr. Sayers, a guard on the trains between Burra and Adelaide for some years has been transferred to the Port line at a day&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<p>Water Supply. No reply from government yet.</p>
<p>Agriculture. A new type of smutting machine was displayed. Invented by Julius Both, a miller at the Burra Mill.</p>
<p>St Mary&rsquo;s bazaar was described as moderately successful with a good attendance on Thursday, but fewer on Friday. It raised £150.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital. Boxes in hotels raised £7l8/3</p>
<p>Entertainment. Review of the Carandinis’ concert of 24 &amp; 26 Nov. It was a performance of grand opera and ballads which was very good. The Saturday audience was &lsquo;wretchedly small&rsquo; and the Monday, while better, was not good.</p>
<p>30 November 1877, Page 2.298-9</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mine. Capt. Hancock of the Moonta Mines and Mr Higgs, late of the Wallaroo Mine having inspected the Burra Mine have circulated their reports to shareholders. Both were rather noncommittal. Hancock did not think the lodes able to be inspected would pay, but deeper exploration might be worthwhile. Higgs thought there might be some prospects, but recommended a search for new methods of ore separation which should also be tried on the debris from earlier operations.</p>
<p>30 November 1877, Page 2.299</p>
<p>Burra Corp. W. Woollacott waited on the Council to complain that his nomination to stand for Mayor had been returned to him opened. The mayor denied that it had ever been received.</p>
<p>W. Woollacott asked for a cheque for £50 in payment for the White Hart Ford footbridge. He was given £40 with the rest to follow when Cr. Sara returned.</p>
<p>Cr. Roberts said the springs in The Paddock were nearly choked and the dayman should attend to them considering the current water shortages.</p>
<p>A group of seven waited on the Commissioner of Public Works to refute the need for an undercrossing near the Bon Accord Hotel.</p>
<p>The Mayor thought he had given adequate notice for the water supply meeting and considered that the whole question should be brought to the notice of the Commissioner of Public Works as it affected the whole town, not just part of it. Cr Roberts moved that the question of a water supply for the whole town be a matter of concern to the Government with representations made from the Members for the District. Carried.</p>
<p>The Mayor and other councillors will attend the Commissioner when he visits shortly.</p>
<p>District Council of Burra. A deputation from Copperhouse waited on the D.C. as a consequence of the meeting on the rabbit rate. Mr T. Warnes was offended by the meeting and its tone. He accused the Copperhouse of selfishness in seeking to escape their responsibilities and of impertinence in calling for resignation of members of council from other wards.</p>
<p>Mt Bryan D.C. asked that the road at the back of Hallett&rsquo;s Woolshed be repaired.</p>
<p>7 December 1877, Page 2.302</p>
<p>Water supply. Ed. Up to 5 Dec. there had been no government response. The matter was growing serious. Many residents have wells [which seems to contradict statements at the meeting] and except for stock purposes consumption would not warrant additional expense and therefore a trough in the reserve behind Preece&rsquo;s is all that is essential. £150 would solve all essential needs.</p>
<p>In Kooringa the creek supply is also dwindling, but water is more easily obtainable there from the spring near the wool washery. As this point is higher than Market Square no artificial means are needed to raise the water; just a main to a convenient public trough. Expenditure of perhaps £300, half from public subscription and the rest a government subsidy if the Corporation takes the matter up.</p>
<p>Gifts. A sale of gifts will take place this afternoon in the Bible Christian Schoolroom.</p>
<p>Aberdeen Hotel. Proprietorship has passed from Mr Orchard to Mr J. Broad, formerly of the Willogoleech Hotel.</p>
<p>Burra Corp. Mr Edward Lipsett (lb7) defeated Mr Stephens (121) and was sworn in as new mayor. The new councillors: North Ward: A. Bartholomaeus, Middle Ward: William Geake, South Ward: W.H. Batchelor, with F.R. White and J.D. Cave as Auditors.</p>
<p>7 December 1877, Page 2.303</p>
<p>District Council of Burra decided not to repair the road at back of Hallett&rsquo;s Woolshed but to allow the D.C. of Mt Bryan to do so if they wish.</p>
<p>Burra Public School has been completed. A lengthy and detailed description with dimensions follows. It is nearly 190&rsquo; long with a turret rising 60&rsquo; to house the 1501b school bell. Front wall 24&rsquo; high and it is 36&rsquo; to the ridge. Built of the best Burra Quarry stone pointed in blue mortar with an asphalt dampcourse at an average 2&rsquo; from the ground. 13 steps lead up to main entrance. A description of the classrooms with their disposition and dimensions follows. The boys and girls playgrounds are separated by an iron fence 6&rsquo; high and each has a shelter shed 18&rsquo; x 50&rsquo; and each end of the building has a 10,000 gallon underground tank fitted with a pump. It sits on 2 acres, the building covering about 1150 squ. yds. The building has 61 windows and 32 doors and cost c. £7,000.</p>
<p>14 December 1877 Page 2.306</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines. Ed. An extraordinary meeting of shareholders is to be held soon to empower the directors to dispose of the whole property. It is feared that any buyer will be merely a speculator wanting to hold the property and plant until such a time as the copper price rises and enables them to sell to other speculators at a profit. This would not be very reassuring for the town as no jobs would be forthcoming in the short-term.</p>
<p>Some rumours however, suggest that there are potential buyers who would seek to prove the ground in all directions to determine future prospects and find the best portions to work. Indeed speculators seem unlikely to find it attractive in the present depressed state of the copper market as long as the directors are not prepared to sell at an unreasonably low price. The presence of a rich lode at present undiscovered is a much disputed question.</p>
<p>Burra Burra Mines. The adjourned meeting of shareholders was resumed on 11 Dec. with Sir George Kingston presiding. Satisfactory prices were reported from the recent sale of surplus materials and another meeting of shareholders in the first week in January will seek permission to sell the whole of the property.</p>
<p>Rabbits. Are getting worse and yet the new rabbit bill is stalled in Parliament which is due to go into recess soon. Last week the Mt Bryan D.C. received 50,000 scalps for which they paid Id each or £208/6/8 which shows the futility of a rabbit rate of 1/- in £L In a single week almost a year&rsquo;s takings in the rates can be expended. Much better to compel all owners to destroy the rabbits on their land and for the Government to do so on Crown land. The 50,000 above made no dent in the rabbit population of the area. Late Dote: the Legislative Council has postponed consideration of the rabbit bill for six months.</p>
<p>Hallett Railway. Almost nothing happening. The earthwork is done and materials for plate-laying are to hand, so why the delay? A daily paper says that it is to start in earnest in the New Year with completion about May. A bit of effort could see the line open to Mt Bryan for this season&rsquo;s grain.</p>
<p>Burra Corp. Mr T.W. Wilkinson was the only person nominated to fill Mr Lipsett&rsquo;s place on the council when the latter became mayor.</p>
<p>The mayor and councillors visited the site for the proposed undercrossing near the Bon Accord Hotel on the 13 Dec. The Commissioner of Public Work&rsquo;s visit is scheduled for Sat. 15 Dec.</p>
<p>The Town Clerk, Mr C. Lowe reported no reply to his letter to the Govt re the water supply -&rsquo; sent the previous Saturday.&rsquo; [Council met on 10 Dec. so Sat. was 8 Dec. but they couldn&rsquo;t have expected a reply that quickly so presumably he meant the letter was sent Sat. 1 Dec. which would have been a timely despatch.]</p>
<p>Bible Christian Schoolroom sale of gifts on 7 Dec. raised 00 for the Church Fund.</p>
<p>Burra Young Men&rsquo;s United Assoc. Good attendance for readings and recitations.</p>

<p>Burra Corp set a charge of £1-10-0 for erecting of a tent in Market Square by Mr Thwaites for photographic purposes.</p>
<p>There are still 177 rate defaulters. Cr. Roberts moved they be proceeded against at once. Carried.</p>
<p>The services of the dayman are to be dispensed with at once as the new rates will not bring in money till March or April.</p>
<p>A Banquet at the Commercial Hotel on Tuesday evening was presided over by the mayor, E. Lipsett. It honoured Mr. P. Lane, retiring mayor and Dr. Cave, who is moving to Jamestown to another practice. The mayor was supported by T. Warnes, Thomas Bath, P. Lane, Dr Cave, and Capt. Sanders. 30 gentlemen sat down to a `capital spread&rsquo;. Capt. Sanders gave the address to Dr Cave and presented him with an inkstand. The Town Clerk, C. Lowe gave the address to P. Lane, but the presentation of a 4 piece tea and coffee service, suitably engraved, had to be deferred to Wed. evening at the Commercial Hotel. There were songs and recitations as well as the usual toast and speeches. Mr Grant for example recited &lsquo;The Charge of the Light Brigade&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Ed. on Christmas.</p>
<p>Hallett Railway. Last Sat. the Commissioner of Public Works visited the area and ruled that there would be no undercrossing at the Bon Accord, though the level crossing would be improved to make it safer. The Mt Bryan Railway Station will be located on Sec. 75, half way to Hallett from Burra, to the advantage of the settlers of Mt Bryan Flat and Mt Bryan East.</p>
<p>Water Supply. The Commissioner of Public Works visited last Saturday and said that our water wants will soon be satisfied. The conditions under which the Government gets its water from the Bon Accord will not allow the resolutions of the meeting to be carried out without the permission of the Yorke&rsquo;s Peninsula Mining Association, but this is only a formality.</p>
<p>21 December 1877, Page 2.311</p>
<p>Water supply. Water from the Bon Accord Mine shaft will be supplied as requested to a trough, though the formal agreement of the Yorke&rsquo;s Peninsula Mining Co. is needed.</p>
<p>Rabbits. There is a fear that some Legislative Councillors with pastoral interests hope that rabbits will drive farmers off grazing land. Some farmers are indeed in the position of deeming it futile to plant grain as they reap less than they plant. Things are very bad east of Burra at Baldina and Mongolata and also further north at Banbury. At Mongolata for instance on 3 of 2,000 to 3,000 almond trees remain on F.T. Jones property, and then only because the dogs were tied up next to them! This was a loss of £200. Mr Moyle got only 5.5 bags of wheat from 60 acres instead of an anticipated 600 bushels - a loss of £ 115l8/-.</p>
<p>Burra Public School. Mr James Cater from Princes St School Adelaide has been appointed master of the new school which should open early next year.</p>

<p>Wesleyan Picnic at Princess Royal was a great success with the woolshed again available. The gross proceeds were c. £55.</p>
<p>J. Richardson hosted the New Year sports at the rear of the Commercial Hotel which started with few in attendance, but later the crowd grew to c.200. The Burra Brass Band attended and besides the common sports there was: - Jumping in Sacks, greasy tailed pig, and jingling in the ring.</p>
<p>Climbing the greasy pole was won by J. Williams who won the 21/- prize, while G. Camp won 10/6 for the 100 yards jumping in sacks. There were no entries for the Jingling in the Ring. Williams and Hall won the 21 yd Quoits match for the prize of 151-, and T. Lavann threw the hammer 59'4&quot; to claim the £1 prize. There were no entries for the Treacle Buns, but C. Parks secured the greasy pig after a hot chase across the church hill. Brakenridge won £2 for the 1.5 mile race. There were various other flat races and jumping events.</p>
<p>Aberdeen Hotel attracted few people to its New Year sports, but still seven events were contested with spirit.</p>
<p>Primitive Methodist Social on Dec. 31 attracted about 80 people. J.R. Gray presided and there was the presentation of a testimonial to Mr John Prior, a local lay preacher of long standing. (The poor man received Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs, The History of the Primitive Methodist Connexion, and a large Primitive Methodist Hymn Book - all elegantly bound) The social ended at 10 p.m. but some stayed on for a watch-night service which began at 11 p.m. to pray the old year out and the new one in.</p>
<p>Copperhouse Primitive Methodist Chapel anniversary was celebrated last Sunday and Tuesday. Proceeds amounted to £15-6-6.</p>

[Broken Hill did not get going till 1885 and despite a touch of silver at Thakaringa and in the Silverton area in 1876, nothing much had developed by this date and the great expectation was for a copper discovery, perhaps as an extension of the lodes at Cobar.]</p>
<p>Burra School. By 10 Jan. there were 86 boys and 95 girls enrolled along with 53 infants for a total of 234.</p>
<p>Rabbits. The Northern Rabbit Meat Preserving Co. has taken over the premises of World&rsquo;s End Station for the purposes of rabbit preserving.</p>
<p>Weather. The year began very hot. Last Thursday the temperature in various shops in town varied from 102°F to 110°F.</p>
<p>Hotels. From 1 Jan. 1878 the Licensed Victuallers Amendment Act closed pubs on Sundays except between the hours of 1 &amp; 3 p.m. except for residents and bona fide travellers who lived over 5 miles away and had travelled that distance that day. A first or second offence attracted a fine of £5-£S0, while a third led to the loss of the licence. Consumers of alcohol were also subject to fines of £5-£10.</p>
<p>Offences. A letter to the editor points out that the Corporation inspector was good at fining people for allowing animals to stray within the town contrary to by-law, but what of the by-law forbidding storekeepers to &ldquo;place, hang up, or otherwise expose for sale within the said town any goods, wares, merchandise, matter, or thing whatsoever, so that the same be or project upon, into or over any footway beyond or outside the doorway.&rdquo; &ldquo;It would be difficult to say what is not exposed on the footpathe&rdquo; [sic] by the Mayor, the Ex-Mayor, Councillors and others. Why is there one law for some and not for these?</p>

<p>Burra School. A public meeting at the Institute was held on 9 Jan. to decide on the ceremonies for the opening of the school. Chaired by the Mayor, E. Lipsett. A committee was formed of Revs. R.W. Campbell &amp; T. McNeil, Messrs T. Bath,&rsquo; A. Bartholomaeus, W.H. Batchelor, J: Cater, F.W. Holder, J. Roberts, J: Dunstan, W.F. Coglin, W. Parker, H. Pettier, W. Geake, &amp; - Sara (Sen.)</p>
<p>22 Jan. was selected as the day. Gov. Jervois was invited to open the school along with Members of the Ministry, the Board of Education and the Members of Parliament for the district. Local dignitaries of course and the Friendly Societies would be asked to take part. There would be a banquet at the Institute and the former Mayor [P. Lane] would be included in that. The Burra Brass Band was engaged and refreshments for the scholars were also organised</p>
<p>Burra Corp. Correspondence cited indicates that as yet there has been no answer from the Bon Accord owners allowing erection of the water trough at the station, though they do promise an early one.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Police indicates that P.C. Wilson has been shifted for a sufficient reason and he will not intervene. The Council decided to continue to press for his return to Kooringa through the efforts of the local M.P.s (Rees and Rounsevell)</p>
<p>Burra Cemetery. This is now overgrown with weeds and grass and what used to be `a pleasant resort&rsquo; is now a comparative wilderness.</p>

<p>Burra School was opened last Friday. The town shops closed at noon and the midday train brought the Hon. Neville Blyth, Minister of Education; Mr J.A. Hartley, President of the Council of Education; Mr Inspector Witham and Mr Inspector Stanton, who were entertained by the Mayor at lunch in the Institute, which involved the usual speeches and toasts. The lunch was catered for by Mr T. Richardson of the Miners&rsquo; Arms Hotel. A deputation of the Mayor and the Corporation asked that the school be made a model school. With the enrolment now 420 there are insufficient teachers and it is expected numbers will rise to about 600.</p>
<p>A procession formed in front of the Institute comprising the Official Guests, the Mayor and Councillors, influential citizens and members of the various friendly societies in full regalia, together with the Burra Brass Band. They marched through Market Square, across the ford and up to the school. The official party was accommodated on a dais in front of the school. The band played The Song of Australia and the usual speeches followed.</p>
<p>After the opening of the school the official party inspected the Hospital.</p>

<p>The Annual Bible Christian District Meeting was held at Kapunda on 5 Feb.</p>
<p>Water Supply. There is a summary of the recent moves to get a water supply. The permission of the Yorke&rsquo;s Peninsula Mining Co. has at last been obtained to use the water from the Bon Accord Mine. The supply will extend from the Bon Accord to a point about opposite Ridgway&rsquo;s store, where a trough and standpipe have already been erected. The editor clearly thought that had the Corporation backed the move adequately there should have been a water supply for the whole town.</p>
<p>There has been talk of laying a main from the spring at the wool wash in Kooringa into Market Square, but nothing has yet come of it. No real scheme for a permanent water supply has come from the last Corporation meeting except for an idea of extending the line from Ridgway&rsquo;s to Market Square. So Kooringa is Dow worse off than Aberdeen, which also has some surface water in the creek as a result of last Saturday&rsquo;s rain.</p>
<p>15 February 1878, Page 2.343</p>
<p>The Burra Corp. discussed the whole water supply issue on 13 Feb. The Corporation was under the impression that all that the Govt. was going to do was to place a water trough at the Station Gate, fed from the Govt. main. They were caught unawares when a supervisor and twenty men arrived with instructions to lay a pipe from the Station along Morehead Street and up, Best&rsquo;s Place to the National Bank at Aberdeen.</p>
<p>The Mayor, Mr Lipsett, `believed that a private interest had been brought to bear upon it.&rsquo; Also things were worse in Kooringa where the water supply was in the hands of one man. He thought that the line could be extended to Kooringa while the men were there to do it, but Cr Roberts pointed out that it was only a 3&quot; main and they should urge the Commissioner of Public Works to supply the whole town. Cr Roberts wanted to condemn the Commissioner.</p>
<p>Cr Bartholomæus agreed they should urge the Govt to supply Kooringa as well. Mr Geake said they should write to the Commissioner pointing out the injustice done to Kooringa. Cr Wilkinson suggested a deputation wait on the Commissioner, while The Mayor said they had already written. The Mayor did not begrudge Aberdeen water, but since the Govt. had voted £820 for the purpose Kooringa should get some of the benefit. In the end they decided on a deputation to ask that the water trough be shifted to the station and seeking clarification of liabilities and cost implications for the Corporation.</p>
<p>In the event that Mr Rounsevell being unable to introduce them, they should seek some other independent member like C.C. Kingston, rather than their other representative, Mr Rees, whom he felt had pandered to private interests and had been operating with the Commissioner as to the water supply arrangements.</p>
<p>[As reported this must have been a rather heated meeting with the whole council much offended by the Govt. action. It is also sometimes incoherent, several times straying onto other subjects in mid stream, such as the Kingston St Bridge and a ford in need of attention.]</p>
<p>Kingston St Bridge. No real action, though the iron work for it has been 4 ordered.</p>

<p>Redruth Wesleyan Chapel. The bazaar in aid of the building fund was brought to a close on Thursday Feb. 14, by which time it had raised £50. The ladies have raised £120 in the last nine months. Three years ago the building and furnishing cost £1,450, but the debt is now only £600.</p>
<p>Water Supply. Letter to Ed. querying why the Aberdeen standpipe is kept locked when parties are waiting for water. Water carts are in a fix since they have no appliance at the Bon Accord to load and the trough at the railway gate is dry.</p>
<p>The Burra Corp. resolved not to recognise the resolutions passed at the meeting at the Aberdeen Hotel re the water supply question. [See report on page 347]</p>
<p>22 February 1878 Page 2.347</p>
<p>Water Supply. A meeting was held at the Aberdeen Hotel on 16 Feb. with J.D. Cave in the chair to consider the water supply question. Henry Dawson ran back over the events leading up to the present situation: Rosman&rsquo;s motion for a trough at the Railway Station gate, The committee to see to the erection of the trough and the collection of subscriptions, Ridgway&rsquo;s motion to extend the supply down Morehead St, Young St and Best&rsquo;s Place.</p>
<p>Now when the Govt. has taken it upon itself to vote £820 to supply Aberdeen with water, the Mayor has taken offence and believes Kooringa should also benefit. Cr Roberts condemned the Commissioner for his action. The Mayor then said they should get an independent member to introduce their deputation to the Commissioner if Mr Rounsevell was not able. [The other local member, Mr Rees, would appear to have been blamed for the Govt.&rsquo;s decision in the first place and so was persona non grata. I</p>
<p>The Mayor was of the opinion that a trough at the Railway Station gate would satisfy all. The meeting however, felt that this would deprive Aberdeen of their rights with the pipe already laid to the near the National Bank with a standpipe and trough erected. The meeting then resolved unanimously &ldquo;This meeting disapproves of the action of the Burra Corporation in interfering with the water supply of this Ward, thereby damaging the best interests of the ratepayers and the public generally.</p>
<p>W.R. Ridgway said he thought the Govt. were doing remarkably well if only left alone. In order to make the works more useful they should be extended to Kooringa. He moved that the meeting thank the Engineer-in-Chief and the Commissioner of Public Works and requests continuation of the pipes in the first instance to the White Hart Hotel and to Opie&rsquo;s Hotel. He felt that the Corporation should take over the running of the waterworks. He moved a motion asking the Corporation to ascertain the names of owners of property [who would be interested in a water supply] and the amount of water they thought they would be likely to use if the scheme were extended.</p>
<p>Burra Corp. There is a detailed summary of the deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works which resulted in the water trough in Aberdeen being moved from opposite Ridgway&rsquo;s shop to the Railway Station gate.</p>
<p>The Mayor accused the Commissioner of not carrying out his promise of a trough at the station gate. Now he did not want the trough moved, but another at the station gate. Commissioner Hawker expressed surprise at the mix up and said that as there was already a trough in Burra it would be moved from opposite Ridgway&rsquo;s store to the station gate. He then asked them not to request a water supply for Kooringa until a hydraulic engineer arrived from `home&rsquo; (England).</p>
<p>On his return to Burra the Mayor was unexpectedly told that the work was already done and he was given two keys; one for the trough and one for the standpipe opposite Ridgway&rsquo;s shop. The town was also placarded with notices for a meeting to condemn his actions. He and Cr Roberts had attended the meeting and were astonished to find the Town Council the subject of censure. He wished to say that he had &ldquo;never passed any censure on the Commissioner or Mr Rees&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government had no right to grant the request of a few memorialists to the extent of £820, while ignoring the simple request of the Corporation for a trough to be erected for the convenience of teamsters. The Corporation felt they had been grossly insulted and interfered with. Cr Robert moved:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the Mayor and Corporation of the Town of Burra very respectfully request the Commissioner of Public Works to regard them as the proper medium through which the wants of the town ought to be made known, and with very great deference point out that the recent granting of a water supply to only one portion of the town at the request of some private ratepayers has a tendency to weaken the influence of the corporate and representative body, and, as a matter of course, cause them to be ignored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seconded Cr Batchelor, and carried.</p>
<p>The standpipe not having been asked for Cr Roberts thought that they should return its key. The mayor thought that Kooringa was worse off than Aberdeen for water and badly in need of a trough, and they might make arrangements with one of the water carriers to supply Kooringa with water. Cr Batchelor moved that the key be returned as the Corporation consider that the scheme would be a failure financially and otherwise, have never recommended and cannot recognise the erection. Cr Geake favoured keeping it lest it otherwise fall into private hands that might make money out of selling the water. He suggested finding out what the Commissioner in Adelaide might suggest. The Commissioner might suggest some course of action.</p>

<p>Remove the old tool house and replace with a new tool-case and add 3 or 4 new hitching posts for horses.</p>
<p>Remove all loose earth etc.</p>
<p>Someone to be employed to keep the place in order for £12 p.a.</p>
<p>That Jeffrey Pearce be paid for a 200 gallon tank in the cemetery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a light trellis arbor, with a suitable roof, be erected, available for, funerals on wet days, and which, when overgrown with creepers, would be also an ornament to the cemetery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the remaining 100&rsquo; of ground belonging to the cemetery be enclosed by moving the wall that distance out.</p>
<p>He was instructed to prepare plans for the arbor and get a costing.</p>

<p>Rabbits. In the H. of Hallett rabbits have severely reduced many farmers’ crop yields. One farmer got only half a bushel per acre and others only 3 bushels. Some have however got as much as 20 bushels per acre, with the average being a little over 7 bushels per acre.</p>

<p>Tweed Factory. John Dunstan Jnr. writes in support of the idea.</p>
<p>Burra Cemetery. A letter to the editor poses a number of questions relating to the cemetery. SAMA gave the cemetery to a trust. The writer wants to know: Who were the trustees?</p>
<p>Did they appoint the late curator, David Wells?</p>
<p>Has the cemetery been properly conveyed to the Corporation? Could the trust spend cemetery funds on other matters? What happened to the £140 received from the late curator? Has it been kept separate from other Corporation moneys?</p>
<p>Can the Corporation use it for non-cemetery purposes?</p>
<p>Why, if it is still there, cannot it be used to put the cemetery in good order? He goes on to say that “the idea of a `trellised arbour&rsquo; as a substitute for a mortuary chapel is delicious in its absurdity.&rdquo; A mortuary chapel is needed:</p>
<p>To obviate the necessity of very often taking the body a long way round to whatever church the deceased may have belonged to.</p>
<p>Because in this climate it is most undesirable, in very many cases, to take the corpse into a place of worship.</p>
<p>The conditions of the cemetery are much worse than under the curatorship of David Wells and so either the money mentioned above should be expended on the cemetery or the Corporation should carry out its duty from its other funds.</p>

<p>Hallett Railway. The present Government has shifted the Hallett Railway Station half a mile out of Hallett. The new arrangements would allow a private developer to survey a new town within an eighth of a mile, but the Government town with the P.O. will be almost a mile away. A deputation to the Commissioner of Public Works, Mr G.G. Hawker asked it to be placed where originally advised. Hawker said the original site subjected to flooding, but he thought the best solution would be to erect a temporary platform with the final station location to be decided when the line is finally extended to the north as is likely to be sanctioned by the new parliament. This meant that work on the permanent station would be stopped. The deputation was thus satisfied.</p>

<p>10 May 1878 Page 2.387</p>
<p>The town of Shebbear which was to be offered for sale on 16 May has been withdrawn due to the decision to continue the railway from Hallett to Terowie. A selector, Mr Mitchell had illegally established a private town he called Terowie, with a public house and a blacksmith&rsquo;s &amp; granted land for a Wesleyan Chapel. A government school followed. Shebbear was surveyed out of the travelling stock route at the same place, but on the opposite side from Terowie. This annoyed the people who had bought land at Yarcowie as the two towns, only separated by 5 miles; would interfere with one another. There is another government town 12 miles beyond Terowie; Launcelot. [Actually Lancelot - now abandoned]</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Crown Lands believed Shebbear should go ahead to save the Govt. from having to buy private land for its services. [A Govt. town of Terowie, opposite the private town was surveyed in 1880. Manning in Place Names of S.A., says under Terowie that the place was previously Gottlieb&rsquo;s Well, but under Gottlieb’s Well he indicates that that place was south of Terowie!]</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Rambler&rdquo; says Burra has little to recommend it except for the splendid Institute, commodious hospital and grand Model School. Its other corporation activities, public works and improvements are almost entirely absent and in this Burra is twenty years behind the times. Money needs to be spent on attracting some industry, making the streets, paths, tree planting - notwithstanding which it has a rich social life.</p>

<p>Editor. The business part of the paper will be conducted by F.W. Holder as managing editor. Eight gentlemen are the proprietors &amp; form a Managing Committee. The paper is not to be a party organ or a vehicle for personalities.</p>
<p>Water Supply. A hydraulic engineer has visited us and levels have been taken and it is, we hear, the intention of the Govt. to bring a supply of good water to our doors. We hope soon to hear of a good practicable scheme being approved. Much of the water now being used in the Burra [note the editor’s use of the definite article here in contrast to the previous editor’s practice] is impure and that from wells is very hard. The majority of water in wells in town even where there is good drainage has organic impurities. In Burra no drainage system is known. Water in covered tanks is less contaminated, but foreign matter does still enter. A water supply will save much labour and remove the need for the excessive economy exercised with it now in many parts of the town. Hydrants may be connected for use in fire fighting. Persons don’t plant trees because they cannot afford to water them for the first year or two. Water for gardens cannot be spared. Sanitary authorities suggest it will lead to better health and lower mortality.</p>
<p>Hallett Railway. A sarcastic article claiming that the following advice was taken: - • choose the lowest ground • choose ground closest to the main stream where all the tributaries will be at their broadest • run the line parallel to the road to encourage restless horses • have as many road crossings as possible • avoid Govt. Reserves and run across farmers’ land far enough in to give cause for substantial • find a bog for the terminus at least a mile from town • use as few culverts as possible and ignore local advice re water flows • if you are facing the embankments do so only on the side opposite from where the water comes. • ensure any turntable is located so it will fill with water at every rain • the Burra-Hallett line matches these desirabilities most closely With respect to extending the line from Hallett we believe an analysis of where most traffic from the area is headed — Port Pine, or Adelaide — should determine where the break of gauge should occur. At present this would suggest a break of gauge near Ulooloo or between there and Yarcowie.</p>

<p>Burra Town Council is to have the Kingston St Bridge abutments modified [apparently for easier access from either side, but the copy is torn at this point.] Burra streets are not levelled and footways are uneven and all is very muddy in wet weather.

<p>Hallett Railway. A meeting was held at Hallett to oppose the extension of the railway to Yongala. The mood was that the break of gauge should be at Hallett and produce north of Hallett should go to Port Pine and south of it to Port Adelaide. The feeling at Pt Pine was for a narrow gauge line Hallett to Jamestown. The extension of the broad gauge from Hallett should be to Broken Hill via Yarcowie, Terowie, Gumbowie, &amp; Mannahill. Some thought that these two views were contradictory, but others thought not. There was also a proposal for a break of gauge junction at a place 16 miles from Jamestown to the north of Hallett. Resolved: the break of gauge should be Hallett Moved that the broad gauge go to Broken Hill via Yarcowie, Terowie and Mannahill. Amendment 1 to reaffirm first resolution. Amendment 2 that the Govt connect Jamestown and Hallett via Yarcowie on narrow gauge Amendment 1 carried. After some further discussion both amendments were set aside. The resolution was then lost. The second amendment above was then put as a motion. Amendment: The Jamestown line be extended to Yarcowie, there to meet the broad gauge line extended from Hallett. Amendment lost and motion carried.</p>
<p>Terowie Railway. A railway meeting at Terowie saw 120 people meet at the Terowie Hotel last Tuesday. Moved: the meeting view with great approbation the proposal to extend the railway from Hallett via Yarcowie and Terowie to Yongala. [There was a great deal of discussion, mainly over gathering support and forwarding resolutions to relevant Govt ministers etc.]</p>
<p>Letter to Ed. from ‘Outsider’ complaining about the issuing of distress warrants for unpaid rates. As they have £245-7-5 ‘in hand’ they would be better advised to sort out the bridge approach muddle [Kingston St] and ‘getting a road opened from the north west corner of Paxton Square to Hampton so as to give access to Public School, cattle yards and Brewery (singular trio) before the hitherto liberal S.A.M.A. place too high a value on their land and make the affair [sic] to [sic] expensive . . .‘ There are ‘ample opportunities of displaying their genius without troubling themselves about Bridge abutments being a little asquue [sic]. [The editor is not sympathetic to these comments and he answers the points raised.]</p>
<p>Offence. John Dunstan Sen. Was summonsed for a stray pig in St Just St, but as it was not clearly identified the case was dismissed when Mrs Dunstan gave evidence their pig was in the sty at the time in question. [Note this suggests that the Dunstans lived in St Just St &amp; Assessment Notes say they lived in Section 1; i.e. on the south side of the street.]</p>
<p>Offence. Thomas Richardson fined 10/- for stray pigs in Commercial St.</p>

<p>Roads. We are all aware that the state of our roads is poor and what we need is a system of repair that does not just do a patch job which lasts until it rains, but a durable one. The roads from Paxton Squ. to the Smelts and from the Hospital [referred to as the road to Princes Town] are both so subject to gullying that they are execrable and dangerous and need a deal of money to repair them. [Continued page 3] Trenches are needed to stop water cutting across the road and creating gullies — a stitch in time&hellip;</p>

<p>Show Society. Adjourned AGM reported on 1877. The ploughing match held on 16 Aug. with prizes amounting to £20. The show of stock on 12 Sept. was at the yards of the E. &amp; A.C. Co. at Redruth. The only problem was the narrow means of communication between the two yards used. This will have to be obviated if the site is to be used again. The grant-in-aid of only £37-0-l1 led to a decision not to stage a show of fruit, grain and flowers etc. in a large room in the town, but it is hoped to do so with the stock show next year. F.W. Holder was elected Chairmen at Annual Meeting 21 June 1878. For the next year the President was re-elected; the Vice-Presidents were Capt. Killicoat &amp; H. Dawson; Treasurer, Mr Rosman of the National Bank; Sec. J.D. Cave. There was a committee of 40 which included F.W. Holder. It was proposed to use the E &amp; A Copper Co. Yards for 1878.</p>

<p>Offences. Various people fined for stray animals in the town &amp; one for depasturing stock on a stock road &amp; not moving 1,800 sheep the required 5 miles per day. Alfred Wilson got 3 months in Redruth Jail for stealing apparel from a tent of two young men called Metcalf at Mongolata on 8 July.</p>
<p>Letters to Ed. Rabbit rates do little good at all. The rabbit preserving works have seen no reduction in rabbits — indeed the numbers are increasing. Instead of a rate we need a compulsory eradication Bill without which absentee owners will do nothing.</p>
<p>‘Progress’ writes that railways need to be located to open up the country, they need to be pushed into the heart of the country &amp; to the Barrier. Branches to be added later. The writer felt that the N-E was able to grow wheat and therefore needed the railway though squatters would oppose it as resumption of leases would follow.</p>

<p>Editorial on Town Council and Public Works. A meeting of ratepayers has been called to authorise the borrowing of £400 to meet expenditure connected with the new bridge in Burra. Visitors to Burra must wonder at the ‘primitive condition as regards roads footpaths &amp;c.’ For many years SAMA policy of leasing and not selling allotments prevented progress. The same cause of uncertain tenure and mistrust of SAMA saw the railway terminus so far from the business centre. The annual income of the Corporation is about £800 of which £600 is from the rates which, if expended on public works, attracts a subsidy of a like sum allowing £1,200 to be spent in a year on improving the town. (Or if the police rate be deducted still nearly that sum) This year began with a debit of £300 and now over £200 is in hand or to be received and it is proposed to spend this on necessary works, but such as attract no subsidy. Thus if we deduct the £300 debt and say £250 from the £600 mentioned above only £50 is left to spend in such a way as to attract a subsidy, i.e. Govt. subsidy this year would only be £50. Govt. grants-in-aid to Councils are doomed to disappear in the near future. To spend rates on things that are not subsidised is suicidal. We therefore welcome a proposal to borrow a sufficient sum to meet these types of liability and the interest payable will be amply repaid by the immediate increase in comfort and ease of communication between one part of the town and another. If the loan be approved at least £200 can be spent to attract £200 subsidy. Next year’s income will be left intact for useful works. There is of course the repayment and interest on the loan, but these would be spread over several years and would not be nearly as great as the advantage obtained. Act 16 of 1861 allows for a poll of ratepayers if at least six demand it. At this poll ratepayers assessed at £25 annual value and below get I vote and there is 1 vote extra for each additional £10 to a maximum of 6 votes. The Act provides for the issue of bonds at an interest rate not exceeding 6% and the bonds would not be bought at par. The Corporation would get probably £94 for every £105 and at that the bonds would likely be taken by the banks on the security of the rates. Repayment would begin in say three years by which time grants-in-aid are likely to have ceased. We should be free of debt in seven years, having had seven years of comfort.</p>
<p>Rabbit Problem. Long 2nd leader. Dynamite has been found wanting, as have sulphur fumes producing machines. Mr G.A. Gebhardt has had great success with bi-sulphide of carbon. This is available at 2/6 per oz. As a fluid and an ounce will do several large warrens. A little on a rag on a small stick is placed in a hole and the mouth of the warren is blocked. The fumes then circulate and suffocate the rabbits. As the animals are not poisoned the carcases are not dangerous to dogs or pigs.</p>
<p>Commercial St has been remetalled this week and loads of earth have been carted in to blind it. All the time the water table was full of suitable matter that would best be removed from where it merely retards the run-off and makes it hard to cross the road.</p>
<p>School. The Burra School has £16 outstanding in school fees, but in fact much of this is an accounting fiction. Owed fees are recorded when an application for exemption is made, but not removed from the list when an application is successful.</p>

<p>Burra Town Council. 22 July. Cr Roberts moved the calling of a public meeting to authorise the borrowing of £500. His lengthy speech outlined the need to improve roads and footpaths in the town. Further details are similar to the editorial comments. Cr Geake 2m1. Cr Wilkinson amended the sum to £400 to meet the expenses of the new bridge. Cr Batchelor 2’ and Cr Roberts eventually withdrew his motion and Cr Wilkinson’s then passed unanimously. The Mayor again brought up the removal of Constable Wilson and felt that the Council had been ignored despite its paying a proportion of the police salaries. A letter is to be sent to Mr Rees MP calling for it to be inquired into in Parliament. It was resolved to get Mr Rees to come and look at the approaches to the new bridge which were still causing concern.</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest at Leighton on 22 July before J.D. Cave JP on the body of Robert Everest, a boundary rider who drowned the previous day. The body was found in Farrell’s Creek in reeds about 3⁄4 mile below the crossing — he was seen to enter the water in attempting a crossing. He was drunk at the time. The verdict was that death was accidental, but may not have happened, but for his being under the influence of liquor. [Died 19 July 1878 near Booborowie, residence Booborowie aged 61.]</p>
<p>Letters to editor. J. Richardson writes defending himself against charges of rowdyism at the Commercial Hotel and asserting that hearing singing and swearing 100 yards distant was, to say the least, false.</p>

<p>Captain Sanders, who for 51⁄2 years managed the Burra Mines is about to leave the colony to take charge of one of the Gippsland mines. A number of Burra friends invited him to the Corporation Office to present a silver inkstand and locket as a memorial of Burra. The Mayor made the presentation with an accompanying address. Mr Lane expressed the satisfaction he had had in working with the Captain in the Corporation and elsewhere. These feelings were echoed by Messrs Coglin, Bath and others.</p>
<p>Terowie Railway. The Hallett-Terowie railway Bill has reached the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>The Loan Meeting is reported at length. Some 200 ratepayers attended. Cr Wilkinson said the income of the Corporation was £600 rates, + £200. Once they got rid of the overdraft they would in future have £500 to spend on public works and £300 for current expenses. This year they had to pay an old debt of £300 and had £200 in hand. This, with working expenses, accounted for the whole £800. The extraordinary expenditure of the new bridge had to be provided for in an extraordinary way, either by borrowing, or a special rate. He thought ratepayers would prefer borrowing. If this was refused they would have to take the £200 in hand to pay for the bridge along with £200 from next year. Only the year after next would they be able to spend the full £500 on town improvements. This and the two following years they would spend £800 and with Govt. subsidy, £1,600, less the £550 for police, leaving £1040.</p>
<p>With the loan they could spend at once £200 with £500 more each other year, totalling £1,200 or with Govt. subsidy a total of £2,400, less the £550 for police, making £1,840, or £840 more than they could without the loan. The town desperately needs roads and footpaths to benefit workingmen and storekeepers. Before long it was expected the Govt. would abolish the grant-in-aid and therefore they should get what they could now. The plan was to borrow £400 and begin to repay after three years, paying off £100 in each year thereafter to eliminate the debt in seven years. The interest would amount to £176 leaving a clear gain to the town of £224, besides the immediate benefit from the roads, paths etc.</p>
<p>Cr Roberts 2nd. Mr A. Harris spoke against the loan and moved no loan be allowed as an amendment. Mr Tiver 2nd — along with Harris he thought it was to mortgage all our property. Mr Geake spoke against the amendment — the ratepayers’ burden would not be increased by the loan and no extra rate was proposed. He felt the approaches had to be paid for and personally thought a 6d special rate the best way, but if not that then the loan. Otherwise there would be no public work carried out till 1880. It was no use crying that the council did nothing if it was given no money to work with. Mr Cave asked if the Govt. would not supplement the money spent to purchase the approach to the new bridge. They would not, said the Mayor. Mr Dawson opposed the loan. Mr Cave questioned whether the Govt. wouldn’t support a new road purchase. Mr Lane said the surveyor had asked the Corporation to try to get the approaches opened through Messrs Statton &amp; Henderson’s yard and they had done so. Cr Roberts supported the Loan as being the best way of maximising the Govt. subsidy while it was still available.</p>
<p>The Town Clerk said the sum first asked for by Messrs Statton &amp; Henderson for the last 10’ of land was £200 besides the other agreement for the 30’. Mr J. Beaglehole made a rather confused contribution with references to the past legal costs of the council and the future legal costs too. Mr Kitchen could not understand why anyone would oppose the loan. The state of roads and paths was a disgrace and there was not a clean place to walk if it rained except on limestone hill. They ought to do this for the sake of the town and to get the subsidy. Mr Harry thought the Corporation shouldn’t be given money as they didn’t know how to spend it. Rev. Jenkins was opposed and favoured a special rate. Mr Fogg wished to say Messrs Statton &amp; Henderson had not asked £400 for their land. No, said the Mayor, but that would be the total cost of the operation. A poll was then demanded which was held on Tuesday and resulted in 154 for and 146 against.</p>
<p>Obituary &amp; Inquest on Tuesday, into the death of Sarah Ann Fogarty, who had died the previous morning. [Died 30 July at Redruth aged 18.] Sarah Foy, mother of the deceased, gave evidence that her daughter had had very severe diarrhoea and given birth to a stillborn child. On the Saturday night Joseph Foy was sent for the doctor to Dr Dashwood, but he wouldn’t come and Joseph then roused Dr Nesbitt who attended, They sent for a doctor at 12.30 am, Dr Nesbitt was roused at 2.00 am on Sunday morning. Dr Nesbitt refused a death certificate as he had been called so late to the case and thought she may have had typhoid fever. Dr Dashwood saw no evidence of typhus or typhoid when he saw her Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday and never knew she was in labour or dead till Monday morning. The verdict was that death was due to natural causes.</p>
<p>Obituary &amp; Inquest at Hallett on Wednesday 31 July on F.B. Garlin who had died suddenly near Tommy’s Gap after walking over a difficult piece of ground; the passengers having alighted from the Jamestown-Hallett coach to ease the load for the horses. The deceased had died quite suddenly after being helped back into the coach suffering from palpitation of the heart. The verdict was death by visitation of God.

<p>Editorial on the Land Bill Originally in SA land had been sold at auction to any buyer who chose to bid and most were speculators who sold again at enhanced price to the intending cultivator. The Govt. missed out on the higher price and the cultivator was crippled by the cost he had to pay. Various systems have been tried to get land opened up to the agriculturalist for as low a price as possible to encourage genuine farmers to develop the colony. Now we have over one million acres cropped annually. Many areas once thought impossible for grain are now farmed and even served by the railway. The present Bill before Parliament is aimed at opening untried pastoral land in the far north, by giving larger areas and more secure tenure to leases. We support the general principles of the Bill. 42 years seems a long term and perhaps 28 years would be more just, but at least that time is needed for the land to be truly tested. We do not support the compensation arrangements and unless resumption took place within 21 years nothing beyond the actual value of improvements should be paid, especially as 3 year’s notice to resume is required. We do not agree that those who have already held land on credit should be allowed to select again.</p>

<p>Show Society. The second annual ploughing match was held on Thursday in dusty and windy weather, but there seemed to be little interest and few entries. The double plough (£7 prize) was won by John Bailey. [Corrected in the issue of 30 August to Thomas Bailey] The single plough (£5 prize) was won by T. Wilson. Boys’ competition 1st and 2nd prizes were not awarded. 2nd prize of £1 to F. Fairchild. [Sic?]</p>
<p>Rabbit Bill. 30 people met at the Miners’ Arms on Saturday to discuss the Rabbit Bill. The general consensus was that compulsion was needed. Mr Rogers reported that despite much work and cost on his land and at Baldina his wheat field was as bare as the table. In the last 5 weeks he had killed 1,300 rabbits — all from large holdings near his. H. Dawson did not agree with blaming the graziers who were as damaged by the rabbits as the farmer and the remedy was Bi-sulphide of Carbon. The Govt. should assist with its production. A bit of rag on a stick 1 or 2 feet long is wet with c. 1tsp of the liquid and thrust deep into the hole which is immediately sealed. Digging rabbits out was a failure. A rabbit rate or a preserving works only kept them on. A meeting on the same subject at Mt Bryan East also strongly supported the compulsory clauses of the Rabbit Bill.</p>
<p>Offences. J. Richardson fined 5/- for a stray cow in Kooringa. T. Richardson fined 5/- +12/- costs for 2 stray cows. R. Austin fined 10/- for stray sheep in Redruth.</p>

He questions the likelihood of the Govt. subsidy being discontinued and claims they would also be paid on the bridge approaches if raised by subscriptions or rates. He also fears that revelations that the north end of the town voted against the loan will not be conducive to town unity or goodwill.

<p>Burra Musical Union Concert. This was held last Tuesday and saw a good sale of the front seats, but a thin audience elsewhere. The review suggests a rather patchy performance; though the choruses which are the core of the Union’s scope of work were a success. More of this rather than the solos should be their aim. The larrikin element is again complained of.</p>

<p>Editorial on the closing of public houses on Sundays. The editor felt that the cause of Sunday closing had lost much of its credibility and support due to the lack of discretion and knowledge on the part of its advocates. The question is not just a teetotal question, though they have taken it up. Only recently a Bill to limit Sunday trading was carried. He then went on to advocate the total abolition of all Sunday trading. Rev. Charles Clark drew a large crowd to his lecture on Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>Redruth Local Court 23 Aug. Thomas Kerr was charged with stealing a flask of brandy at Opie’s Hotel on the 22 instant. Mr Opie deposed that the prisoner was in the bar when the witness was called to by a person and left the bar briefly. On his return the prisoner was just leaving the inside of the counter and a flask of brandy was missed and found on the prisoner. 21 days in jail. Rheder v. T. Richardson. Rheder was walking in the square when Richardson hailed him and asked him if he was going to settle an account. They went to the hotel and after some discussion Richardson tore up the account, came round the bar, collared the plaintiff and put him into the road. Rheder says he did not swear in the bar, nor was otherwise abusive. Defendant did not hurt him. Defendant could not get the barmaid, who saw it all, to give evidence as Mrs Richardson was ill and the maid couldn’t leave the bar. Fined 11- + 10/- costs. Counter claim of Richardson v. Rheder for abusive language was dismissed.</p>
<p>Wesleyan Schoolroom, Kooringa. The foundation stone was laid on Monday by Mrs Bruse. Rev. H.T. Burgess gave the prayer. Mr Holder read out the contents of a bottle placed beneath the stone. Rev. W. Campbell then asked for a collection of donations to be laid on the stone and £24 was collected. So far they have £279 and the ladies hope to raise £250 at a bazaar. The total cost is expected to be c.800. Rev. H.T. Burgess spoke of his connection with the school 30 years before as a scholar, teacher, secretary, etc.</p>
<p>Rabbits. A ratepayers’ meeting at Hallett decided on the rabbit rate, though many thought it rather useless and compulsion was the only way to go, but in the meantime. . . There was a debate on whether to make it just a rate to clear the Council of debt on the rabbit account (a 41⁄2d rate) or to go for more to pay for scalps as well. Mr Dunstan moved for a 1/- rate. Mr Windsor amended this to a 6d rate, but the amendment failed.</p>

Cave explaining in detail just what authority he has to admit patients and under what circumstances, essentially none except that a circular from the Destitute Board makes certain people eligible from outside districts of necessity to preserve their lives. He also explains, as Secretary of the Hospital, how the story actually unfolded. [It was basically a storm in a teacup, but once everyone had taken a stand on their dignity it was set to escalate into an ongoing public sore.]</p>

<p>Advt. Primitive Methodist Church Anniversary, 15 &amp; 16 Sept., preacher Rev. T. Jarret.</p>
<p>Editorial on the coming Legislative Council election. Despite the fact that L. Councillors hold office for 12 years and will materially affect the Govt. for perhaps longer, the electors seem uninterested in this election. Immediate questions are the reform of the Council, rabbit control/destruction and the Mortlock Bill (Sunday trading in liquor). The editor was opposed to small single member electorates for the L. Council, but instead of a single electorate for the colony thought it might stimulate more interest if there were, say, six large electorates. He then goes on to discuss the views of each of the candidates on key issues so that voters can decide more readily who to vote for. The election will be held on Tuesday 10 September.</p>

<p>Sunday Closing. There was a meeting of about 70 people at the Inst. last Friday to consider a response to the proposal to repeal Nock’s Act which limits Sunday trading in liquor. The Mayor took the chair. Rev. R.W. Campbell moved that in the opinion of this meeting the Nock’s Act has not had a fair trial, no valid reasons for its repeal, and it is to be regretted that attempts to repeal it are being made. At first the idea was to ban all Sunday trade, but for travellers over 10 miles. This would have closed suburban hotels so the compromise was for 2 hour trading and a reduction in the distance for bona fide travellers to 5 miles. It had only been in for 4 months. 3⁄4 of a column follows before Rev. W. Jenkin 2 and the motion was carried unanimously. Rev. W. Richards moved that: ‘A Sunday Closing Act conduces to morality’. 2nd Mr Sleep and carried unanimously. Mr Holder moved ‘That this meeting pledges itself to support those candidates for the Upper House who are favourable for a Sunday Closing Act’. The Bill repealing Nock’s Act had passed stages 1 &amp; 2 in the Lower House with big majorities and the Upper House was the only hope of stopping it. Mr W. Pearce 2nd Rev. Jenkins moved and amendment that the meeting pledge themselves to vote for those candidates who were in favour of the Nock’s Act provided they believed them to be as good in all other respects as other candidates. Mr Burrows Carried — but the majority in the hall were not in favour of either the amendment of the motion. [Presumably this suggests many abstentions on this issue.]</p>

<p>Obituary &amp; Inquest. On Wednesday before P. Lane JP an inquest was held on the death of Thomas Beckwith who had died that morning. Dr Robert Brummitt saw the deceased Sat. evening and he was suffering from shock, internal injuries and a broken rib. He requested Mr Gonne to send him down in the morning if the opportunity arose. He was sent down Sunday afternoon. In hearsay evidence Mr Cogan, the deceased’s employer, said Beckwith was going towards Hallett with an empty wagon. He sent a person on horseback to bring him back and deceased was found on the road with the wagon about a mile away. Beckwith, though partly conscious, said nothing about the accident. Joseph De La Hunty said the deceased had told him the bullocks attempted to run away and in trying to put on the skid he was knocked down and the wheel rolled over him. He had not been drinking. The same story had been told to his mother who, in evidence, complained about his treatment at the Willogoleech Hotel. Deceased would have been 17 on 14 October. [Thomas Gabriel Beckwith born 8 October 1861 Hillside near Burra: died 2 September 1878 Burra, residence near Hallett.] The evidence of Elizabeth Cameron, nurse, confirmed the above. The inquest was then adjourned till Wednesday to get Mr Gonne’s evidence. Dr Brummitt was recalled and said he was satisfied about the state of the room at the hotel. Gonne’s evidence was compatible with the above. Verdict was accidental death.</p>

<p>Editorial on the Water Supply. What is being done? 1. The Govt. has spoken of including the supply of Burra in the supplementary estimates — not yet before the House. 2. We do not believe it necessary or desirable to have a house-to-house supply for the whole town. Many people possess good wells and a spread out town like ours would be too costly to service. ‘On the other hand we saw, only a week or two since, some persons dipping up with some small vessel into a bucket the thick, unclean, and unhealthy contents of a puddle by the roadside, and carrying it carefully homeward. It could not have been to wash anything with, so we are driven to the conclusion that it was for drinking or cooking purposes.’ More than ever the prosperity of Burra depends on the outside country which is represented by teams with more to come with harvest time. There is at present no adequate provision for watering teams. It becomes desirable for some scheme to be put in hand as early as possible. An inexhaustible source must be chosen. It does not have to be high as it only needs to reach the most thickly settled parts which are all at the lower levels. Pipes must be laid from the source to convenient points central to the houses not having a supply — say Paxton Square, Market Square and one or two other points in Kooringa, and four or five points in Aberdeen-Redruth. Each point to have a standpipe and trough. The water to be sold at so much per 1,000 gallons. A meter should check totals. A house supply could be arranged for those houses where it was desired along the route of the main; to be metered and charged for, but with no cost to the non-users.</p>

<p>Burra Institute. Article by F.W. Holder, ‘Next to the public schools of the province we regard Institutes with their reading rooms and libraries as the best mental educators of the people.’ The first Institute in Burra was erected on the site of the present building — it was small and incomplete and had a prison-like appearance. To Mr David Wells goes much of the credit for the present arrangements. Other early supporters were Rev. D.J. Ibbetson, Messrs Oldham, A. McCulloch &amp; Challoner and some of the present trustees like Capt. Killicoat, Messrs Gare, Bath and others. The present Institute is one of the best outside Adelaide with a large lecture hail, lodge room, reading room and three other meeting rooms, Corporation Office, etc. The cost of all to be noted as: - Land (Given by SAMA) £500- 0- 0 Original building cost £954-18- 0 Large hall &amp; reading room (1874) £1384-13-10 Masonic Lodge room &amp; librarian’s cottage £663-13- 2 Minor alterations £15- 1- 4 Total £3518- 6- 4 Costs have been met by: - Govt. Grants £1245- l0- 4 Raised £1382- 2-11 Land donated £500- 0- 0 Balance still owed £390-13- 1 There is now a library of c.2,000 books with about 3,700 circulating annually and 30-40 visitors to the reading room per day. The library costs subscribers 3/- a quarter or 5/- for double borrowing rights. There are reference books, newspapers and journals. Entrance to the reading room is free. Various Friendly Societies meet in the smaller rooms. The lecture room is not used as much as it might be for that purpose, but a large income is obtained from travelling companies and others. It is planned to establish a collection of mineral specimens, especially copper ore, but also various items of interest from other parts of the colony. A small start has been made. Much is due to the painstaking and obliging librarian, Mr A. Dearlove.</p>
<p>Repeal of the Nock’s Act. [After Mr Campbell’s speech re the repeal of the Nock’s Act he was reported in the Advertiser in a scathing and scurrilous way.] There was a large meeting at the Inst. on Wednesday to hear Mr Campbell’s reply to the attack on him. 150 were present and the Mayor was in the chair. Campbell had been grossly insulted and attacked and the paper’s tone had sadly deteriorated since the death of John Henry Barrow and William Harcus. Campbell said it was not a question of whether he or the Advertiser was better at trading insults, the principle was much more important. He felt that the liquor trade could be wisely and well regulated. The Advertiser wanted to go back to open slather on the grounds of ‘liberty of the subject’. The editorial writer also sheltered behind his anonymity and the privileges of the press. He had been charged with irreligion and unfitness for ministerial office and dragging in the mire the religion of meekness, charity and love. The Advertiser had said since the Nock’s Act Sunday drinking had doubled, Sunday drunkenness had doubled and the old way was, by comparison, paradise. But no statistics to support these allegations were available. It was useless to look at figures of five years ago for comparison. Since then there had been a large population increase. [This and much more.]</p>

<p>Editorial on the coming legislative session. A Bill for a railway from Hallett to Section 216, H. of Yongala has been passed and the question now is the extension of the line north to Pichi Richi and southwest to Jamestown. This Bill narrowly got through a second reading this week. The Real Property Act Amendment Bill is making progress. The Adelaide Sewers Bill has reached committee stage and seems likely to pass. The new Parliament House site is still undecided and so holds up the decision on the new Museum and Public Library.</p>
<p>Obituary. We regret to announce the death of W.H. Banks of the Unicorn Brewery at 33. He had lived in Burra c. 9 years and was almost universally popular as a man of straight dealing and willingness to aid community projects. He caught a cold last Monday week which led to inflammation of the lungs and died last Monday. Places of business closed Wednesday afternoon out of respect and over 30 traps followed the hearse.</p>

<p>Burra School article by F.W. Holder. It is a characteristic of Kooringa that all its best buildings are public institutions churches, banks, the Institute, Post Office and Model School. Until a few years ago no town in SA was inferior to Burra. It had no special purpose buildings for schools, only dilapidated rooms that were rented to the disadvantage of both teachers and students with respect to health, comfort and efficiency. Three years ago Mr Holder, then a teacher, organised a deputation to the District Council to ask that a schoolroom be erected. The Council decided to wait for the decision of Parliament on the Education Act then before the House. The new Act passed and it was expected that really suitable accommodation would be built as it was one of the aims of the Act, but many delays followed before plans were eventually prepared which showed that Burra was to be first in the style and size of its schoolroom. The foundation stone was laid with due ceremony by Mr Bath on the same day that the hospital was formally opened. Sara &amp; Dunstan completed the building at the end of October 1877, but the building remained empty till January 1878, despite children being crowded in inconvenient and unhealthy rooms in the summer heat. The cost of the new building was £6996-8-0 and capacity was 800, or up to 1,000 with extra seating. There are six large schoolrooms, a similar number of classrooms and a teachers’ room, lavatories and a large play-shed. It now needs only adequate fencing to be complete. The opening was celebrated with a banquet. The first headmaster was Mr James Cater. Other teachers were Miss Snell, Miss A. Snell, &amp; Messrs F. &amp; J. Snell. Council ignored the claims for a Head Mistress, but eventually under pressure appointed Miss Cox and later Mr W.C. Grasby was first assistant. Average attendance for the six months to July 1878 was 293.5. It is a shame to see space wasted and a building for £2,000 to accommodate 600 would have been more than adequate. The cost at present is £1,207 for staff or £1-0-7 per child per quarter which is higher than at even the best of the private schools. [The writer then goes on to condemn payment by results as limiting what is taught and the way it is taught.]</p>

<p>Burra Town Council. Cr Wilkinson asked if the council would do anything about the water supply. Cr Batchelor said the article in last Friday’s Record was to the point. The Chairman (Cr Bartholomæus in the absence of the Mayor) said most residents in Kooringa were merely tenants and that was a difficulty. Also if the mine started work again all the pipes laid would be useless and they could not get the water for a fixed term. If water was wanted in Market Square it could be left to private enterprise. Cr Batchelor said it was often hard to get water from the carters and he often had to carry it himself He did not think private enterprise was the best supply; besides the Govt. had promised a supply, so why not get them to keep their promise. The article in the Record was just what they wanted and many more would take from such a supply if it were convenient and the water carts would get supplies from the standpipe. He did not want anyone else to pay for his water and he was willing to pay 20/- per 1,000 gallons for a regular supply. Cr Geake said something had to be done even last summer there would have been no water for stock if the Council had not cleared the springs. Cr Sara said if mains were laid either all would have to pay or the Council would. The Chairman thought that at Pt Augusta the charge was 20/- per 1,000 gallons. Cr Sara thought it would be closer to 9/- per 1,000 gallons, whereas now it was 2/- for ‘a very small load.’ Cr Wilkinson moved that a letter be sent to the Govt. reminding them of their promise.</p>

<p>Obituary &amp; Inquest before J.D. Cave JP at the Commercial Hotel on the death of the child of Mrs McNeil. [Donald Paul McNeill born 15 November 1873: died 14 September 1878.] Mrs McNeil said the child, who was 5-6 years old, was standing on a sofa trying to reach something from a nearby cupboard when he fell across a piece of wood in the fireplace. She picked him up, held him and scolded him, then briefly left him, only to return and find him on his knees on the bed, stooped. She asked him where the pain was and he pointed to his chest. She could not see any bruise and he died within twenty minutes. Dr Nesbitt said there were no marks or bruises on the body, or other signs of violence. He was unable to give a cause of death — whether due to rupture of internal organs or to shock — probably the latter. A blow to the stomach can cause shock resulting in cessation of respiration. Verdict: accidental death.</p>

<p>Obituary. John Hoskin Pascoe aged 48, on 19 Sept. at Pichi Richi Pass.</p>
<p>Editorial on Farming in SA. About the ease with which it is taken up by the inexperienced and the lack of a permanent tenant class. More intensive settlement is desirable. There is a need to develop a crop rotation, but as yet there is no systematic scientific study of how to keep land productive or to maximise yields and sustain them. We have come to the end of space — of new land - and therefore must look to these changes.</p>
<p>2nd leader. Our attention has been drawn to an extraordinary letter in the Australian Star signed ‘Humanity’ accusing us of partiality and unfairness. The Mayor (it says) cannot explain his side of the case. [re the Burra Hospital] In fact Mr Lipsett sent us only two letters and both were published — the first, long one, as received, the second with some minor changed which were discussed with Mr Lipsett. The Star complains that the surgeons and their friends can get their letters published. Fact — one surgeon wrote two letters and both were published after alterations at the request of the editor. The Secretary of the Hospital Board wrote one long letter and refused to change the wording at editorial request. It was printed as a paid advertisement. The Star then asserts that the Record is owned by the Hospital Board. But in fact: - Hospital Board &amp; Surgeons Proprietors of the Record Rev. H. Howitt (Chair) Dr Nesbitt Rev. R.W. Campbell Dr Brummitt Mr Roach Messrs Sara &amp; Dunstan Mr Coglin Mr J. Drew Mr Rosman Mr T. Drew Mr Lewis Mr Wilkinson Mr J. Drew Mr J. Roach Mr T. Drew Mr F.W. Holder Mr H. Dawson Mr Cockrum Mr Warnes Dr Nesbitt Dr Brummitt The three proprietors who are not on the Hospital Board are connected with the Corporation and would therefore be claimed by the Mayor.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital article by F.W. Holder The old mine hospital was the building opposite Mr Roach’s Mill. SAMA granted this building to become the town hospital. A building committee was set up in 1875 to take steps to add to these premises and Sara &amp; Dunstan entered into a contract for the work when just then the Burra Hotel came on the market and for various reasons the committee decided to take the hotel in preference to the old hospital building. The property taken over was valued at £1347-15-9 and additional sums were collected in 1876 of £71l-l2-9 and in 1877 of £114-4-0 to form a building fund, supplemented by the Govt. and the formal opening of the hospital after repairs, alterations and additions was on 27 February 1878 by Sir Henry Ayers. On the same day the foundation stone of the school was laid. The Board of Management, elected by subscribers, also met that day. It had been contemplated that the Board would run the hospital and the Govt would match the sum raised by private donations and subscriptions. But on 13 March 1877 the Govt. was asked to bring the hospital under the Hospital Act of 1867 and it agreed. This gave the Govt. the right to nominate a proportion of the Board. The income now comes from the Govt. grant and private benevolence. Income includes the churches’ ‘Hospital Sunday’ which last year raised £27-3-0. Contribution boxes are placed around the town, e.g. in the hotels. Private patients can also enter for a fee — last year bringing in £109-12-0. Fees for a bed &amp; sitting room 1st class are 15/- a day, bedroom 1st class 9/- a day, small room 7/- per day and the general ward, 6/- per day. The hospital is at present very satisfactory. The honorary surgeon system has made it a very economical arrangement. Staff at present is Miss Lucy, two nurses, two servants and a porter.</p>
<p>Burra Public Affairs. A communicated article. This was a complaint that the town was characterised by factional division of an unnecessary nature. The divisions grew from ‘pettifogging assumptions’. The recent hospital dissension is typical and the history of the Town Corporation is another.</p>

<p>Editorial on the uselessness now of the School Boards of Advice which no longer render any service to the Department. e.g. Pt Adelaide board asks why schools in their area were closed without any consultation or advice. Even on deciding on who gets a free education the boards don’t decide only recommend; the decision is taken in Adelaide. At present all they seem capable of doing is to protect teachers from frivolous complaints’. This centralisation of power is not sensible.</p>

<p>Burra Cemetery. The final article in the series by F.W. Holder. The author considers it is ‘not a place one would choose for joyous meditation at all times’ and comes to the conclusion that cremation would be a preferable way to dispose of bodies. But as long as we have cemeteries they should be as pleasing as possible and arranged to suggest peace, rest and beauty. Not because he considered it ‘desirable to encourage the practice of making the cemetery a place [to] walk, for of all places it is the most unsuitable and unhealthy for such use. ‘Casual Sunday afternoon strolls through the Cemetery are entirely out of good taste and nothing can more grate upon the susceptibilities of those who hold dear the memory of any resting there, than to see a mixed throng carelessly reading the inscriptions, commenting on the character of the monuments, or laughing and playing among the dead far better if the cemetery were not thrown open so publicly as it is for health, propriety and many other reasons.’ Mr Wells, the late curator laboured for many years to maintain it in a good condition, but since his times the Corporation has been in control and his care is sadly missed. The writer then suggests that a garden cemetery would be preferable to stark bare ground with regimented rows of graves, or a weed infested wilderness. The cemetery needs expanding and SAMA has agreed to allow expansion towards the creek, but they are very slow in arranging the deeds. Also some sort of structure is needed to provide a place for services in extreme heat or wet conditions or where the danger of contagion makes it undesirable to have the coffin in the church. A large trellis arbour open at both ends and well surrounded with creepers and well roofed would suit admirably.</p>

<p>Burra Town Council. The Mayor complained that he was quoted correctly, but out of context in the last report in the Record.

<p>Editorial on Burra Cemetery. The need for more room grows urgent. There seems some difficulty in getting the title from SAMA. Also there is a need for a water supply at the cemetery. There is a spring in the hills just above the enclosure and it should be easy to bring down a stream of fresh water to the plants in the cemetery.</p>
<p>2nd leader on the mayoralty. There is a suggestion in Adelaide to limit the selection of the Mayor from people who have already served as councillors or aldermen. Cr Roberts drew attention to this with possible reference to Burra. The editor felt that it was an inauspicious time to do so on the eve of an election. It could be interpreted as a political move favouring one contender. In a community with so few people able to serve it would be foolish to further limit the numbers available for selection.</p>
<p>Water Supply. The Govt. is taking further steps towards providing a water supply for Burra and it seems likely to take the form of free public fountains paid for by the Corporation by means of a rate.</p>

<p>Burra Town Council. The main debate was about mayoral elections as mentioned in the editorial.</p>
<p>Land Act. There was a public meeting at Mr Midwinter’s at Baldina on Saturday afternoon 26 Oct. to get the Govt. to extend the time for the payment of the 21 instalment of their interest on selections. Nearly 40 selectors were present and they face an almost complete failure of crops due to a combination of rabbits and dryness. A memorial for forwarding to Govt. was approved. They also asked for a road to be opened through section 15, H. of Baldina into the timber reserve. Rowland Rees replied that there has not been time for a reply from Commissioner Playford, but he has given an assurance that it will be looked on favourably in the event of a crop failure.</p>
<p>Hallett Institute. There is a 11⁄3 column report on the establishment of an Institute at Hallett. The meeting raised £43 to start it off.</p>
<p>‘Bystander’ writes complaining that visitors still see Burra as a ‘miserable looking place’. He says they should address their complaints to Sir Henry Ayers as the failure of most to get freehold title is the real reason for that.</p>
<p>Railways. The Millicent to Rivoli Bay line may be open for the harvest.</p>
<p>The Hospital Dispute. There is an advertisement of 11⁄2 columns by the Hospital Board members — not paid for from Board funds. It comprises various letters including one from the Chief Secretary via his undersecretary giving Crown Law advice re the Mayor’s right to send patients for admission to hospital. This should surely close this sorry affair. Several letters affirm that the Mayor (E. Lipsett) was claiming the Attorney General’s authority for his being able to admit people to the hospital despite not being a subscriber, doing so by virtue of his office as Mayor. This was cited by R.W. Campbell, Thomas Warnes, &amp; Robert Brummitt. The Board wrote to the Attorney-General seeking to know whether he had so advised the Mayor. Mr W.T. Sheppard, Undersecretary replied that Mr Mann, when Attorney-General, could not recollect giving any advice on this or any other matter to Mr Lipsett. The Board then wrote to Mr Lipsett asking to know when and where the advice claimed was given; he replied he would answer only if asked by the Attorney-General’s applying to him directly. Further correspondence elicited the legal advice that the Mayor had no power, as claimed, to admit patients to the Burra Hospital.</p>

<p>Crops. Harvest prospects are looking better after recent rain, but some parts of the Eastern Plains in Bright and Baldina are past recovery. Though there is some good wheat at Mongolata over 4’ high and in good ear, the rabbits and kangaroos are playing such havoc in many places that the only safe plan will be to cut it for hay, especially as the shortness of most crops is likely to make hay prices higher this year.</p>

<p>Ratepayers’ Meeting 15 Nov. at the Institute. Only about 30 people attended. The Mayor opened and as he intended to stand again he asked for the election of another chairman. Cr Bartholomæus took the chair. Rates received £535-l 1- 5 Fees £286- 8- 9 Govt. Grant £291- 8- 9 Overdraft £174- 6- 5 Spent in North Ward £50- 3- 4 Spent in Middle Ward £ 175-17- 5 Spent in South Ward £111- 5-6 Police £250- 0- 0 Salaries £148- 0- 0 Rents &amp; Incidental Expenses £292- 0- 0 The Mayor felt that next year they would have more to spend than ever before. He hoped to be re-elected. He had been a local for 11 years. They had not in the past been in a position to improve the town, but now they could ‘make it presentable’ Dr Nesbitt then spoke as a candidate for Mayor. He thought the last year had seen funds spent less wisely than they might have been. With an income of c. £850, £135 had gone in salaries and £600 should have been available for public works, which supplemented would give £1,200 annually to improve the town. He felt that the next year would in fact have less money to spend — in fact almost none! At present the debit was over £11 The current quarter salaries were £35 There was a contract let for £35 The land for the new bridge approaches would cost £175 Legal and other fees related to the bridge work would add £125 Earthwork for the bridge, £50 Money owed to the cemetery account £230 Total £662 With an income of c. £850 necessary expenses and salaries would leave £600 ‘so there would not be a very large balance to spend’ A mortuary chapel should be built at the cemetery. He favoured finding someone who could combine the jobs of Town Clerk, Surveyor, &amp; Inspector and so save some of the salary costs. The 3d rate for sanitary purposes was a farce. It raised £150 which was spent: £50 to the inspector, £10 for the Secretary and £80 to the Scavenger and the latter produced a result ‘not equal to the expenditure.’ More was required than the removal of household refuse. He hoped water supply arrangements could be made to remove the antagonism between the north and south end of the town. He believed it had been decided to erect two standpipes in Kooringa — one in Market Square and one in Paxton Square. Some parts of town had a well in almost every backyard and did not require a scheme that would impose a general rate that would be unfair to those who did not use the water. Any citizen on the mains should be entitled to be connected at his own cost and to pay for water received. He also complained about a misleading flier circulated by his opponent or his supporters in which he was accused of being in town only ‘a year or two’ — actually it was almost 31⁄2 years. He would ignore the comments about competence and experience. He was accused of always opposing the Council — he had opposed the original Council: not the one headed by Mr Lipsett. He was said to be promoted by a clique, of whom Messrs Drew &amp; Dawson were considered the heads, but 104 persons had signed the requisition asking him to stand — a rather large ‘clique’. He didn’t have, the document claimed, one hour a month for the School Board of Advice. This was true because it was a waste of time — on it Mr Ridgway lived at Brighton and was rarely there, Mr Lipsett was Lane, Mr Bath was Lane &amp; Mr Lane was Lane — so it was all Lane. He had never said, as was claimed, that the workingman would vote for Lipsett and respectable people would be on his side. Asked what arrangements had been made for a water supply, Mr Lipsett said none whatsoever. Mr Dawson then spoke against Mr Lipsett and he read reports of what Lipsett had said to the Commission re the water supply. The extracts said Lipsett had asserted teamsters had but two or three wells to depend on for supply. Lipsett rose to object and others interjected that there were in fact no public wells at all. Lipsett rose to say he had been sent to get the pipe extended to Kooringa, but had obtained a trough and standpipe at Aberdeen. He had indeed said two or three wells for teamsters as they could not use private wells. W. Pearce jnr said he didn’t know there were even two or three public wells. Cr Roberts and Rev. W. Jenkin rose in support of Mr Lipsett.</p>

<p>2nd leader on the Mayoral election. The editor comments that the Mayor stated at the outset that he had been misreported, but he did not say what was misreported — presumably nothing of great moment then! Mr Lipsett had our report for four days for any corrections before publication. Mr Lane also objected to the report in the Record — as the paper is merely ‘a party organ’. But in all cases but one on local matters the Record has been altogether on the side of Mr Lane. Letters from the public have been published from both sides. One letter was refused and that from the side opposed to Mr Lane. It was very personal and was only admitted as a paid advertisement.</p>

He would like to see a supply of water for teams in Market Square if the Corporation could so arrange with Statton &amp; Henderson.</p>

<p>Mayoralty Election. At a meeting at Broad’s in Aberdeen the Mayor accused the Record of misrepresenting him [in an unspecified matter.] He saw the future work for the Council principally in footpaths and streets. A plan for a suitable building for the cemetery was in the office. [Probably the mortuary chapel plan previously prepared by F.W. Holder.] He was prepared to give moderate, but not lowest salaries. Sir Henry Ayers had twice been written to about ground for the cemetery and a favourable reply might be anticipated. He was not sure they could get a Town Clerk, Inspector and Surveyor all for £100 p.a. A ratepayer complained that he could have done much better and saved a lot of money, but in fact the ratepayer was one of those who had cost the Corporation so much money in the first 18 month’s of the Corporation’s existence. He then gave some figures relevant to the Corporation’s first 18 month’s. Rates Received £602- 5- 6 Returned through the action of ‘these men’ £164-13- 2 Balance £437-12-3 Licences 1877 £174- 3-6 Licences 1878 £97-18- 0 Court Fees 1877 £21-18- 6 Court Fees 1878 £11- 5-0 Slaughterhouse £55- 6-4 Grant-in-Aid £178-13- 1 Private Subscriptions 1877 £53- 5- 6 Private Subscriptions 1878 £31- 1- 6 Fine on Contract £5- 0- 0 [Total] £1828- 14-0 * [*This figure doesn’t seem to me either to add up or to make any sense. The total approximates what you get if you add up the whole list of the numbers above including the balance in line 3 — which is also a penny out.] Due to Cemetery £222- 3-10 Expended on Public Works 1876 &amp; 1877 £337-11- 8 Expended on Public Works 1878 £226-16- 9 Legal Expenses (Caused by ‘these same men’) £107- 2-10 General Expenses 1876-77 (18 months) £614-19- 0 General Expenses 1878 £316- 5- 4 Slaughterhouse £45- 6- 9 Purchase of Slaughterhouse £35-18- 3 [Total] £1854- 0- 7 * [*This figure also doesn’t seem to add up to me either.] This shows the ‘loss to the town through these Robinites’ They had stopped the town undertaking public works in 1876 of £123-19-1 and in legal costs had used £107-3-10, which if devoted to public works would have attracted a similar sum in Govt. subsidy and so in all had cost the Corporation £214-7-8. They had prevented £160 from being collected in rates which doubled is £320. [i.e. if it had attracted the Govt. subsidy.] In total these men had cost the Corporation a total of £658-6-9, all due to spite the Ex-Mayor and 2 or 3 councillors. He then addressed a ticket which called on voters ‘don’t vote for Nesbitt because he has said that though the working men would vote for Lipsett all the respectable people were on his side.’ ‘Dr Nesbitt had said he did not say so but he did. Then he had tried to soft soap them by telling them they were all respectable but they would not swallow all he said they new [sic] that if he were not in his present position he would pass them like dirt in the street.’ (He then attacked the Nesbitt claim that all thought and acted as Lane — i.e. that Bath = Lane &amp; Lipsett = Lane.) Nesbitt, he said, was brought there by a party.</p>
<p>Nesbitt then spoke. The Mayor had said there would be more money to spend than ever, but a short time ago the corporation had called a meeting to authorise a loan of £400 and the Mayor had said without it there would be nothing to spend &amp; Cr Geake said without it there would be no public works till 1880. And as they had not obtained the money he maintained his view was correct and not the Mayor’s. Rev. Jenkin had said something might be done by throwing the health rate into the general fund and dividing the Town Clerk’s salary into £60 for the Town Clerk and £60 for the surveyor. But as the town was unsanitary the health rate needed to be maintained. Paxton Square in particular was ‘decidedly not reputable’. Every part of the town needed some improvement. He thought that salaries had to be reduced from the present £120 for the Town Clerk and £75 for the Inspector £21 in fees). An expenditure on wages of £200 was too much in a total expenditure of £600. He denied using the expression attributed to him on the ticket re workingmen. Some time ago a deputation waited on the Commissioner to get him to send up some pipes to lay to Aberdeen and some to go on to Kooringa. Lipsett and some others went to Adelaide and on his return the Govt ordered the removal of the water trough to the station gate — about the most inconvenient spot possible and to return the pipes (that would have gone on to Kooringa) to Adelaide. Burra depended on trade and needed water, but it should be paid for by those who used it and not those with wells. Mr Lipsett kept his shop open on show day, hardly to the benefit of the town, as the Burra Agricultural Society was one of the most useful agencies in the town and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Mr Lipsett replied to the water issue. When personal influence had caused the arrangement to be made for a water supply to Aberdeen the Corporation met and sent him and two councillors to Adelaide to try and get the water supply brought on to Kooringa. The Commissioner had said he could not see his way clear to do so, but that a Hydraulic Engineer was on his way from England and would visit Burra to arrange a general supply. There had never been any intention to bring it on to Kooringa and no pipes had been returned. (A voice said ‘Yes; two truck loads.) Some went back, but they were never intended to go to Kooringa. The standpipe and trough were originally intended for the station gate and were repositioned as soon as the Commissioner had found they had been misplaced. Mr Ridgway asked if the Mayor had any scheme for water supply and how it should be paid for. Mr Lipsett said as soon as the Govt. had a scheme he would call a public meeting. Rev. Jenkin asked how many public wells there were in the town. Neither Lipsett nor Nesbitt knew of any. Lipsett said teamsters had to rely on Richardson’s and 1 or 2 more. In answer to another question he said the pipes that were returned were intended to go on to Redruth and Opie’s [Hotel] and not Kooringa and were sent back on the Commissioner’s order. The dispute with Statton &amp; Henderson was in the hands of lawyers and its likely cost was unknown. The Corporation had agreed to buy 30’ of land and afterwards had to get 10’ more.</p>
<p>Lipsett said they had been unable to borrow the £400 at the interest rate they had offered. P. Lane then spoke in proposing Mr Lipsett as Mayor. He explained among other things the ‘Robinite’ problems. The Act required the estimated income and expenditure to be published in the Government Gazette on the 1 September as a condition of making a rate, but as the Corporation was not proclaimed until 29 June it had not proved possible to comply. They could legally therefore get no rates for twelve months. Although other municipalities also were in similar positions only in three had a group of ratepayers taken advantage of it. The Robinites had cost the town dearly. These were the men who were putting forward Dr Nesbitt. He was not an individual, but a party. It was not in the interests of the town that Dr Nesbitt came out, but of the hospital clique. He strongly supported Mr Lipsett for Mayor. Mr Ridgway proposed Dr Nesbitt. He referred to the Robinites and had no hesitation in saying he was one and was proud to have saved a year’s rates from being squandered. He then touched on the Board of Managers of the Hospital question. He supported the need for change as they had paid £690 to get £337-6-5 worth of work done. Mr Dawson 2nd Ridgway’s proposal. He too was a Robinite. In the first year the Robinites offered to try a single case in the Local Court to save expense, but they had been proceeded against and so were forced to obtain an injunction. Next year the corporation again went wrong so four or five of them said if they would correct their error they would pay their rates, but the next day they got an insulting letter so they went to Symon &amp; Bakewell who cautioned the Corporation. A meeting was called to support the Corporation, but instead the meeting appointed five ratepayers to settle it. They met the Council and agreed to an umpire named by Mr Lipsett and though their own umpire decided against them they went and paid their rates. They had promised for themselves and for others for whom they had no authority to speak.</p>

<p>North Ward Election Meeting at Broad’s Hotel Aberdeen Tuesday 25 November. About 30 people attended. Mr W.R. Ridgway spoke as candidate. He was only there as no one in whom he had any confidence had come forward. The council was a mess. The town was in a worse state with respect to streets and footpaths than it was when taken over from the District council and they were in debt for between £700 &amp; £800. Debit Balance £88-3-9 Owed Salaries £36-0-0 Contract in Hand £35-0-0 Land for the New Bridge in Kingston St. £175-0-0 Legal Costs re the New Bridge £ 125-0-0 Due to the Cemetery £250-0-0 Total: £709-3-9 It was time for some new blood on the Council. He then outlined his expenditure plans in some detail. Mr Woollacott said he would withdraw as Mr Ridgway had come out. There was a vote of thanks to the retiring Cr G. Sara Jnr proposed by Mr Tiver and 2nd Mr Ridgway.</p>

<p>Editorial (again) on the need for a town water supply. The Govt. has indicated their adoption, subject to town consent of a plan to be met by a general rate. The Corporation favours one where only those using the water pay for it. Something is needed since in parts of the town water carts cannot nearly maintain the needed supply. The well expected to supply Kooringa has proved inadequate and more than probably the supply will have to come from the Bon Accord.</p>
<p>Dinner to the Ex-Mayor. A complimentary dinner was given for the Ex-Mayor on Monday night. Though a success, it was undoubtedly a party gathering. Though there was an ‘earnest display of goodwill to the guest’ the meeting was ‘deeply scarred with virulent and excessive personal references of a character calculated to degrade the status of the persons taking part in them.’</p>

<p>Burra Musical Union held its first annual meeting at the Institute on 17 Dec. with 35 ladies and gentlemen present. J.D. Cave, President, presided. It was proposed that for 1879 at least one concert should consist of an entire musical work. A season ticket to be 10/6. Various proposals for the year are then detailed.</p>

<p>Report on the Dinner to Ex-Mayor Lipsett. A complimentary dinner to E. Lipsett JP as Ex-Mayor was held at the Institute with host Jos. Richardson of the Commercial Hotel. Mt T. Bath in the chair and Ex-Cr Roberts as vice-chair. About 75 attended. Cr Geake proposed the toast to Mr Lipsett. He was fulsome in his praise of Mr Lipsett and defended him against an accusation that he had wished to entertain a guest invited by himself at the expense of the Corporation. Believing in no clique or party, he had stood free and independent while he filled the office and he had done his best and had never stood higher in the esteem of the public than now. Cr Bartholomæus added some further words of support. The Chairman then presented a solid silver cup to the Ex-Mayor. Mr Lipsett then spoke in thanks and maintained that he had never deserved the dishonourable treatment he had been subjected to. On arrival 11 or 12 years ago he had not thought to reach such a high position in the town. It had been impossible to do much due to the actions of some men who had lost the town £600 in rates [i.e. The Robinites] He still managed to leave the office almost free from debt. He had been drawn into political action in the election to the Colonial Parliament of Mr Rees some seven years ago. ‘He had hoped the ratepayers would have seen fit to return him this year without opposition and it ought to have been so.’ ‘He did not blame the ratepayers for the clique.’ ‘Not Dr Nesbitt personally because he was only a tool as everyone knew and he himself (Dr Nesbitt) knew and would (he believed) say if they asked him.’ He went on to blame opposition to him on the fact he was well educated ‘this was his greatest sin’ His height of 6’6” — one or two don’t like to look up to E. Lipsett His age — ‘you are younger than they . . . you ought to wait until you are grey headed.’</p>
<p>‘It was no dishonour to be 6’6”, nor to own the greatest drapery establishment out of Adelaide.’ When the hospital started others gave £2-2-0, but he had subscribed £5. He had on occasion criticised it with respect to mismanagement, want of extra nurses and two men being allowed to wander nude and mad, having been allowed to get out. As a result he had been grossly insulted. Had ‘those gentlemen said they were sorry he would have gone on with his subscription. He then went into details about the controversy of admitting a man to the Burra Hospital. He claimed he could have overturned the result of the election of Dr Nesbitt in twenty ways had he liked. He accused Nesbitt’s team of keeping a public house open for three days, betted hats, given away garments and free rides down the line. They had disgracefully raked up a scandal against Mr Lane from 20 years ago — all the dirt came from one side. He refers to other allegations raised in the campaign too. Rev. Jenkin, who was unable to attend, sent in a speech to be read by Mr Hill. In it he began by attacking the editor of the Record. He describes F.W. Holder as: - ‘a vendor of Yankee notions, dispenser of homoeopathic medicines, general surveyor of our town, town clerk, editor of a newspaper, and in addition to all this a local preacher.’ It is as much my right as his to meddle in local politics. Mr Lipsett’s moral character has been trampled in the dust ‘at the very time when his truthfulness and manliness were two essential things to secure his return.’</p>
<p>P. Lane toasted the retiring councillors Sara and Roberts — of the third he knew nothing. [!] He raised the issue of the Robinites, some of whom he said were gentlemen who did the right thing afterwards, but others were not. All the difficulty he said had come because a certain party could not endure to see the Corporation as then constituted, but all the pressure brought to bear on the Mayor and Corporation had not affected their unity or desire to do well, though every technicality had been taken advantage of by some parties. Some of those who signed the Round Robin were gentlemen and did what was right thereafter, but others were not and had never the interests of the town at heart. As soon as they found the technical incidents they had sent to their solicitor and done all they could to obstruct and they had their tool in J.D.C. Those men - Dr Brummitt, Thomas Drew and J.D. Cave had looked up an old paper of over twenty years ago — he wondered if their backgrounds were able to bear such scrutiny and hinted that J.D. Cave’s at Lacepede Bay and Gumeracha could not. ‘There was not a place he had left honourably, and he only held his position here on sufferance under the hands of these men, and why did they keep him? Because he was a tool.’ He [Mr Lane] had held more public positions than any man in Burra and defied anyone to say where he had betrayed their trust and now two men called respectable and belonging to the same church as himself and also the editor of the Record had allowed that thing to be got out to their shame. The opposition had said ‘try a case in the local court. Tell everyone there would be no rates to pay for 18 months and the Mayor and Council saw they would at once lose £180-£200 of govt. subsidy spent on public works and told the others the state of the case, but they were not satisfied and when the Council would not yield they sent a deputation with which the Council tried for an agreement, but it would not do so. Ever since the Corporation had been formed action could have been taken against the District Council and still could be. He did not think men could be so scurrilous and dirty and yet sit where they had no right to. When he told the chairmen he said it was right and just. Few knew the work the first Council had to do, sitting night after night making by-laws and paying back rates as a result of the action of these men. It was impudent to say they had done the best according to their ability for there were men in the first council who turned over more money in a month than the Council did in 12 and more than any 3 or 4 in the town. He referred to Crs Sara, Lipsett and Sanders — yet they talked about ability. They worked for the town well and he hoped to meet them together again. He had great pleasure in proposing the health of Crs Roberts and Sara. Cr Sara could not say he was altogether happy at his present position. He could bear out what Mr Lane had said — the opposition was not against measures, but men. He could refute that the North Ward had not a fair share of the expenditure and the books would show that it had. Rev. Richards was glad so many of the ratepayers had come to honour a gentleman so worthy of it. He had not known Mr Lipsett so long as some, but had come to regard him as a good citizen, a gentleman and a Christian. Mr Lipsett had borne his rough handling well. He proposed the ‘Town and Trade of Burra’. Mr W. Pearce responded and Mr W. West proposed ‘The Press’.</p>

<p>Inquest at the Miners’ Arms by J.D. Cave JP as coroner with T. Bath as foreman of the jury, into the fire there. Thomas Richardson, landlord, returned from the Corporation meeting on Monday night c. l0.45 and closed the bar about ii p.m. Mr Adam got four glasses of beer for the billiard room. Went to bed. Some time later someone knocked for more beer, but told him to go about his business — he said he thought the house was on fire. Got up and found much smoke with the fire mostly in casks under the bar parlour and cellar under the tap-room. Sent for the mine fire engine. There was an explosion from the other cellar to the east, sending flame right through the floor and roof. [The next lines are illegible, but seem to say £40-50 in cheques, banknotes and coins were lost in the bar.] A portion of the roof was removed to gain access. He thought a fire a few months ago was caused by matches falling through the floor and this fire might also he so caused. There was a half case of matches and a small lot of kerosene in the cellar. Cellar could be got at by any ill-natured person. Have had threats, but thought nothing of it. The place was insured for £4,500 for the building &amp; stock, and the stable for £500. Henry Skewes, who was sleeping in Room 10, said by the time he was roused and dressed and got out the older part of the building was beyond saving. The effort was then on saving furniture etc. from the unburnt portions. Matthew Adams was lodging at the hotel at the time. About 2.30 a.m. he heard Annie Garland in the passage and she asked me to see her room which was full of smoke. Vivian and I went to see and found it suffocating. Roused Mr Richardson then went to front and found the whole of the cellar on fire and also at the back. Roused everyone in the house. Annie Garland noticed smoke when a little girl of Richardson’s who sleeps in the same room, woke and asked for a drink. Met Harry Vivian coming out of the billiard room and asked him to see about the smoke. Edward Shoard was also in the billiard room and confirmed the above. James Colman, constable, was roused between 2 &amp; 3 a.m. on Tuesday — he thought by John Vivian, and found the cellars strongly on fire. He told them to send for the fire engine and the furniture from the new section was taken into the street. Sergeant Bentley and two other constables arrived about 4.30 am. Shortly after 11 p.m. on Monday I passed the verandah and the bar lights were out and no one was loitering. There were people in the billiard room. The verdict was that there was no evidence to show how the said fire originated.</p>
<p>Letter to Editor from Rev. R.W. Campbell defending himself against the charges brought against him by Mr Lipsett — he admits a few days ago to bringing Mr Lipsett before the church on a charge that was fully sustained. The church court then asked the defendant to resign and on his doing so the charge was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Editorial on the Health Rate.</p>
<p>At the last meeting, Council made no decision re a Health Rate. The editor urges the need for one and says that however imperfect the expenditure has been, an improvement has been made in the town&rsquo;s arrangements and further improvements are needed rather than abolition of the rate. The only ones who have not benefited by the rate are those (very few) who have gardens or possess a horse and cart and can by either of these means dispose of their own waste. Our plan is to have a man with horse and dray at say, £140 p.a. to be employed fulltime and having fixed days for certain streets and with the time not so dedicated to clear vacant lands, waterways, etc. He would take everything, ashes, dust, bones, rags, manure etc.</p>
<p>The Waterworks. The intimation of the Commissioner to the deputation on Friday that wherever the Govt. supplies house-to-house water they will impose a water rate, will make our townsfolk the more determined to oppose such a scheme as such would not be required by at most a bare majority and should not be paid for by all. We hope a similar plan to that already indicated by us may yet be adopted. [i.e. a user only pays scheme]</p>
<p>The Rabbit Act will be strictly enforced on and after 1 Feb.</p>
<p>Kingston St Bridge. It is gratifying to learn that the Govt will supplement the whole of the expenditure on the new Kooringa Bridge; else it would have swallowed the whole of next year&rsquo;s funds.</p>
<p>Philanthropy. The Mayor thanks Mr A. McCulloch of Princess Royal for his liberality in distributing Christmas parcels to the needy of the town. The parcels comprised: -</p>
<p>141b meat 121b flour 81b potatoes</p>
<p>41b bread 31b sugar 21b raisins</p>
<p>21b currants 1/2 lb tea spice</p>
<p>A double quantity was supplied to large families and in all 74 rations were distributed. Inmates of the hospital received fruit, beer and tobacco, together with roast beef and plum pudding.</p>
<p>Primitive Methodist Sunday school, Kooringa, held its anniversary last week and Mr J. Burrows, who has for years promoted the musical side of the church, was presented with a silver hunting watch and gold Albert. Mr W. Winwood of Adelaide presented him with a gold pencil case attached to the chain.</p>
<p>The proceeds of the anniversary were about £26.</p>
<p>Wesleyan Schoolroom. The new schoolroom was opened last Sunday by Rev. T Lloyd, President of the Conference. New Year&rsquo;s Day saw Rev. R.W. Campbell lecture on `Peter the Great: the Typical Russian'.</p>

<p>Kingston St Bridge. The ironwork for the new bridge is arriving and the structure will be a fine one - it is a pity it will be a monument to the incompetency of its designer, being out of line with both the streets it connects.</p>
<p>Fire. On 1 Jan. fire broke out on Booborowie Plain when a sheep trod on a match - it was luckily put out by an army of rabbit exterminators who were nearby. Another in the same afternoon on land of Mr Skews in the H. of Ayers burnt considerable wheat and also damaged the crop of Mr Hallett, just as it was ready for his reaper.</p>
<p>Lipsett &amp; the Church. W. Pearce, Philip Lane &amp; James Phillips write in reply to R.W. Campbell&rsquo;s letter denying that E. Lipsett (now in the north) resigned his membership upon the charge being proved. They say the charge was withdrawn. They also object to the publishing of details of church meetings which are matters for the church alone. The editor comments: - Neither side can say the charge was proved or not: as no vote was taken both views are merely opinions. The other point is the CONDITION of withdrawal.</p>
<p>The charge had in good faith been withdrawn on a promise of unconditional resignation which was accepted.</p>
<p>John D. Cave responds to the slurs cast upon him by Mr Lane at the dinner given to Mr Lipsett, and does so by submitting for publication three letters to him vouching for his good name at the places referred to by Mr Lane.</p>
<p>‘Observer’ writes that he considers the whole debate re the former mayor reflects badly on the participants, but especially on those who profess to be strong Christians or are ministers of religion.</p>

<p>Deputation to Govt. Kingston Street Bridge. There was a deputation to the Hon. T. Playford, Commissioner of Crown Lands, on 27 Dec., comprising Dr Nesbitt (Mayor), Cr Batchelor &amp; F.W. Holder. They sought a Govt. subsidy for expenditure on the Kingston St Bridge approaches. The line of road in question was formerly [though the paper says formally] on the schedule of main roads, but was taken off. The approach would cost £450. Purchase of land £175</p>
<p>Transfer of Title £25</p>
<p>Filling etc. £250</p>
<p>If there is no subsidy then a special grant is sought, as such a sum out of a year&rsquo;s rates of only £600 was unreasonable.</p>
<p>Burra Waterworks. Secondly, the same deputation sought a more efficient water supply for the town. A recent Govt. engineer found a well that yielded only 1,000 gallons an hour. The deputation asked for a standpipe in Market Square from which water carts might take water. The water supply was sadly deficient as the total loss of the Miners&rsquo; Arms recently by fire indicated.</p>
<p>Rabbits. Thirdly they urged rabbit destruction get high priority.</p>
<p>Response. Mr Playford said that the money expended on the bridge would be supplemented by the Govt. except for the £25 transfer cost. He pointed out that a Govt. water supply would bring with it a water rate. The Rabbit Act would be enforced now the harvest was over.</p>
<p>Rabbits. A public meeting at the Institute on 27 December called for united and simultaneous action to be taken to destroy rabbits. It called for strict enforcement from 1 Feb. 1879. It demanded more staff to clear Crown Lands.</p>

<p>[Interestingly given the popular feeling of the time, he was not opposed to Chinese immigration.] As long as the British system of government and civilization is preserved for all and the Chinese made to live under the same regulations etc. as everyone else then: - <code>the Chinese have as much right here as we.' The objections are usually their </code>immorality&rsquo; and working at a much lower rate of pay. Both could be overcome by enforcing laws on sanitation etc.</p>

<p>The Mayor thought not much could be done so long as slaughtering and keeping of pigs was allowed in the town.</p>
<p>Cr Geake thought that without a health rate rubbish would only be hidden and not removed. Cr Ridgeway objected and considered it a waste of money - a loss of £150 from the Govt. and a tax on large ratepayers for the benefit only of those who paid an inconsiderable sum. He moved for a public meeting to consider it. Cr Richardson 2nd This motion was, like the adoption of the health rate, carried on the casting vote of the Mayor.</p>
<p>There was a long argument over tendering out of work versus giving it to the daymen. Crs Ridgway &amp; Richardson being strongly in favour of tendering out.</p>

<p>The cost of coal makes it impossible as an alternative except perhaps at some seaports. The only hope is in tree planting. In some places trees would be a better investment than wheat. The scrub lands would be better kept as a wood supply than sold as agricultural land and `instead of clearing clauses being inserted in the agreements for purchase a limit should be placed on the destruction of the trees.'</p>
<p>Editor re the Health Rate Meeting</p>
<p>While we are not surprised by Cr Ridgway&rsquo;s objection to the rate, (as his views were well stated before the election) but rather surprised that he had been content to see it pass and then try to overturn it at a public meeting. We cannot see the sense in thinking that because we can&rsquo;t do all we desire, we should do nothing. Half a loaf is better than none. It must be better to have rubbish removed to a depot at a distance from the centre of town instead of accumulating at our very doors.</p>

<p>The Health Rate Meeting</p>
<p>On Friday evening about 50 people assembled at the Institute to consider the question of a health rate for 1879. The Mayor, Dr Nesbitt, took the chair and he described what had taken place in Council. The meeting could memorialize the Council to rescind its motion, but the final decision would rest with the council.</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway moved: -`That providing the Corporation relinquish their claim to a health rate this meeting authorise it to levy a general rate of 1/3 in the £ instead of 1/-.'</p>
<p>He argued that a rate that produced £150 was nothing to what was required to place the town in a thoroughly sanitary condition. The main problem was impure liquids running in gutters and to the creek and this evil had been untouched by the efforts of 1878. A general rate of 1/3 would be more useful than a health rate of 3d. The extra general rate would attract another £150 Govt. subsidy.</p>
<p>(Actually the Govt. only subsidised up to a 1/- rate, but the extra would free more of the rates to be supplemented.)</p>
<p>There was some debate about the legality of the meeting.</p>
<p>Cr Geake then spoke in favour of the health rate. He believed that the rate last year had been of great service. The health rate would not do all that was needed, but would be very useful. A trip to the North Ward depot or to slaughterhouse gully would show a large quantity of rubbish had been removed. For workingmen the extra rate probably meant about 2/6 a year and if the general rate went to 1/3 they would pay that much and still have to pay 1/6 or 2/- a time to have their rubbish taken away. He also spoke against referring Council decisions to public meetings as it could be most destructive of council. He moved as an amendment that they have the health rate.</p>
<p>After some discussion Mr Geake withdrew his motion.</p>
<p>Mr Lipsett thought the meeting illegal and moved as an amendment: -`That this meeting cannot interfere with vote for a health rate inasmuch as it was carried by a majority of the Council.&rsquo; After considerable discussion this was carried.</p>

<p>Scavenging. Even though last year&rsquo;s arrangements have been much abused, the lack of any arrangements so far this year has resulted in many regrets which indicate that the old system did achieve something. Now that the Council has decided on a health rate the scavenger will collect household rubbish and anything else that is a nuisance to the eye or nose that can be classed as rubbish.</p>
<p>The Editor also writes regretting the apparent lack of accord between the District Council and the Town Council where they should be co-operating. [The issue concerned the state of a slaughterhouse that was brought to the attention of the District Council by the Town Council.]</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>Re the recent match against Clare mentions among other comments that the Kooringa Club has only been in existence about four months.</p>
<p>An interesting letter from a ratepayer on the dispute between the Town and District Councils. Apparently the Corporation inspector looked at a slaughterhouse in the DC area and then complained to the DC to take action. The editor thought that co-operation in such a matter was sensible, but the writer had a different view.</p>
<p>The Corporation inspector should never have inspected a site outside his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>His complaint should have been ignored.</p>
<p>His complaint was made in order to reflect badly on Mr O&rsquo;Brien, the DC inspector at a time when O&rsquo;Brien had tendered for the Town Council job at £45 and Mr Gray was scared of losing his position for which he had tendered £75.</p>
<p>The ruse seems to have worked and now ratepayers have an inspector at £30 higher cost than necessary.</p>

<p>Burra Town Council. A deputation says the Queens St Bridge is too small for the flow of water and so also is the new Commercial St Bridge. The solution they suggest is a retaining wall to secure the bank of the creek for a distance of some 20 yards to save the foundations of the Catholic schoolroom. They consider the Queen St bridge needs rebuilding at a greater width and to improve the flow of water.</p>

<p>Water Supply. The Corporation has repeatedly addressed the Govt. on the subject and yet we make no progress thus far. Some time ago men from the Waterworks Dept. tested the town well and said flow was abundant, but a pump would be needed. Now another party has arrived to again test the well and so we suppose this effort will again exhaust all activity of Govt.</p>
<p>In the meantime water is obtainable only from two water carts kept busy from early morning to late at night. It has to be ordered a day ahead and often the carter has to be reminded that he has to bring it for another day. As for watering teams, the supply is obtainable only if those need it pump it themselves from the well.</p>
<p>At Aberdeen things are very different. There is a trough at the railway gate and another has just been fixed opposite Messrs Ridgway &amp; Co.&rsquo;s store, so teamsters are readily supplied. Surely a little pressure on the Govt. could force it to erect one or two standpipes and water troughs in Kooringa and if that were done it would supply our most urgent needs. The cost for this would not be great. No pumping would be needed as the water in the well is about 20&rsquo; above the level of Market Square.</p>

<p>A Masonic Farewell was given to Thomas Bath who leaves soon on a trip to England. Mr Bath in responding to best wishes recalled joining the lodge in Kooringa 29 years before and in 1852 so many went to the gold rushes that there was not a quorum for meetings. Songs and recitations were given by members. E. Lipsett `rendered The Charge of the Light Brigade in a capital manner.'</p>

<p>Mr Bath responded, saying he had arrived in the colony as a Govt. immigrant 32 years before with £15. His schooling had not cost more than £2, having never been paid for at more than 2d a week. His first job in Adelaide was as a printer&rsquo;s devil and he accumulated £40. He then walked to Burra and set up business and in less than three years was doing business to the amount of £30,000 p.a. when suddenly the Victorian gold rush caused a plunge when he had liabilities of £10,000, but he managed to pull through and had paid everyone 20/- in the £. Despite the depression in mining there had been fewer failures at Burra than in any other town in proportion to population.</p>

<p>Inquest at the Miners&rsquo; Arms 15 Feb. on the body of James Cummins who was found dead on the property of Mr H.J. Riggs in the H. of Mongolata on 14 Feb. E. Lipsett, coroner. Joseph Ford had employed Cummins for some 17 weeks and saw him alive a week before. He had been on the spree and complained of ill health, but seemed in good health at this time. His wages were paid up and he told Ford to pay the landlord of the Courthouse Hotel all that was coming to him.</p>
<p>The police revealed that the body was reclining with no sign of a struggle. He seems to have tried to shelter himself as the body was covered with a sheet. Walter Walpole of the Courthouse Hotel said the deceased had owed him £7-10-0, having been there 10 days, for board, lodging and refreshments. He had not been very drunk while there and was not drunk when he left.</p>

<p>Editorial on the Burra Cemetery. This needs to be enlarged. Repairs are needed. Money is a problem as although the cemetery is in theory £250 in credit, the Council has borrowed this for other purposes. Not only is money short, but the Govt. has retained over £70 of the expected subsidy to pay for the police. The ratepayers have authorised the borrowing of £400 and it should be done, to be repaid at say £100 in 1881 and £100 in each of the next three years.</p>

<p>Letter to Editor.</p>
<p>A writer complains of children being kept in at school for long periods - sometimes a whole class for the offence of one or two of its members. Of course some punishments are needed, but something else is needed. It is almost impossible to get home and to have dinner if the time is deducted from dinner period and if it is after school it is hard to get home before dark in the short evenings ahead. Many parents, especially those without servants, depend on children to assist after school. The school is very unpopular and I believe this is one of the objections to it.</p>

It could easily be shown that the expense would be repaid.</p>

<p>Aberdeen Bridge. It is some time since the Aberdeen Bridge was condemned and a new one ordered. The old bridge is now unsafe for heavy traffic and the new ironwork has been delayed by the strike at James Martin &amp; Co. in Gawler. A ford will be needed while the bridge is replaced and it might as well be done now for the benefit of heavy traffic.</p>
<p>Roads. Some much needed roadwork has been done on the road from the White Hart to the Main North road and to the road past the jail.</p>

<p>Burra Amateur Athletics Club met at the Commercial Hotel on Wednesday for its second half yearly meeting. A successful year was reported. President Lipsett was glad to see interest in outdoor activities as there had been none when he came to Burra. The grand total of receipts for the sports day from all sources was £76-8-8. Expenditure had been £57-11-10 which left a balance of £18-16-10.</p>

<p>Editorial on the water supply.</p>
<p>Council has received a letter from the commissioner re a report from the Hydraulic Engineer. The Engineer approves of the proposal to obtain water from the well near Kooringa and the supply will be ample for this end of the town. He even proposes carrying the pipes on to Aberdeen. This idea is mistaken as Aberdeen already is well supplied from the bon Accord mine which is much nearer and also we believe on a higher level. The estimated cost of the scheme for two standpipes, one in Paxton Square and one in Market Square, is £800. The cost of maintenance is £100 p.a. + 6% of the establishing cost for an annual total of £148. The engineer does not favour private services for what seem to us insufficient reasons. Without this few people would live near enough to the standpipes to dispense with the water cart and this will restrict consumption almost as much as it is now. Once we allow private services consumption will rise and it becomes a remunerative undertaking. One firm in Kooringa alone expected to use £20 worth a year if the pipes were laid on to their business, taking water at 6/- per 1,000 gallons, which is the price for private services at Aberdeen. This should allow the £148 cost to be easily recouped. Then a free trough in Market Square could be easily funded by the Corporation. It would have been better if the Corporation had to deal with one body instead of with SAMA for the well and the Govt. for the pipes. The Govt. should, as at Aberdeen, have secured the rights over the well.</p>
<p>Mr B. Hill had his thigh broken by a fall of stone at Hampton yesterday.</p>
<p>New Buildings. Mr Lipsett has called tenders to improve his premises and Mr Richardson intends shortly to erect a large hotel in Market Square.</p>
<p>Kingston St Bridge. Since the last issue the iron arches have been put in place. The staging no longer carries the weight of the bridge so flood damage is no longer a threat.</p>
<p>Football. On Tuesday the football club elected Mr Brady as captain and Mr Lasscock as vice-captain. W.B. Rounsevell MP has agreed to become patron.</p>
<p>Gymnasium Club. A fair attendance was obtained to form this club on Wednesday evening. W.C. Grasby took the chair. A committee of Messrs Cater, Grasby, Richards, Urwin and G. Dawson will ascertain costs of equipment and of a room.</p>
<p>BYMMIA will meet in future on Fridays at 8 p.m. in the Institute. Officers for the first six months are: - President F.W. Holder</p>
<p>Vice-Presidents F.R. White &amp; James Cater</p>
<p>Secretary W.C. Grasby</p>
<p>Burra Town Council. Streets currently being formed are Bridge Tce, Welsh Place &amp; Ayers St. A little over £200 has been spent forming streets in the North Ward. The waterworks report was received. (Details are as outlined in the editorial.) The first thing, as Cr Ridgway said, was could they get the use of the well? Cr Geake moved that they apply to SAMA for the use of the well.</p>

<p>2nd Leader on changes to the way Institutes were subsidised. All income was subsidised in the past, but now income from the hire of the hall or a portion of the building, or donations in consideration of the same, will not be subsidised. In Burra the Institute income is £350 of which £200 will no longer attract a subsidy. To make such a change after many Institutes have entered into commitments on the reasonable expectation of the subsidy continuing is unfair. At least 12 months notice of so large a change should be given.</p>

<p>Burra town Council, Special Meeting 24 March. This was called because when the masons at the new bridge got to work on Saturday morning they were denied access by Messrs Statton &amp; Henderson. The Town Clerk said that Statton &amp; Henderson had signed an agreement, but had been advised by their solicitors not to admit anyone to the land. A telegram has since arrived that the agreements have been exchanged and the money paid over, so no further action was needed.</p>

<p>Entertainment last night at the Wesleyan Schoolroom was well presented and it is hoped similar gatherings might be held monthly in winter.</p>
<p>Copper. A copper lode has been discovered during excavations for the new Anglican church, but the present state of the market makes it unlikely to attract much attention.</p>
<p>Mr Bath has resigned from the School board of Advice and Dr Sangster has been appointed in his place. Mr P. Lane has been re-appointed.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council. There is likely to be a deficiency for the year of £507. The finance committee recommends a borrowing of £400 and that only essential work be done.</p>
<p>Burra Races. The third annual race meeting since the revival of the Burra Jockey Club was held on 1 April in the Westbury Paddock. Prizes offered were liberal, but only two stables from Adelaide were represented. The old course in the SAMA&rsquo;s paddock has been sold and ploughed up so it was necessary to but a new one. The new one is about six chains over a mile with the broad side of the oval towards the grandstand. There is a slight inclination up to the straight. There were no accidents of significance. Attendance was only moderate and few ladies appeared. [The attendance figure is not clear, but appears to be `about 1,000&rsquo;.] There were two publicans&rsquo; booths and tea and coffee establishments. Oysters, crayfish and other delicacies were abundant. The Clare Brass Band was hired and a shooting gallery, ninepins, the purse trick and Aunt Sally, or Cheap Jack.</p>
<p>The main race was the Burra Handicap over two miles for 100 sovereigns. It was won by J. Crozier’s b. or b.g. Thave, aged 5 years and carrying 6 st. 81b. Ridden by Hutchins.</p>

Cr Ridgway pointed out that under such conditions the land might be sold at any time and there was no permanence in it as a basis for a water supply.</p>

<p>SAMA 35th Report. Town land has been sold for £3053-14-0 &amp; country lands for £244-3-2. Copper prices remain too low to justify mining. Profit for the last six months is £1349-8-8. Since the mines have closed the miners had generally obtained employment in well-sinking, fencing etc. to the north, leaving their families in Kooringa. The water in the mine had risen to within 5'6&quot; of the 20 fathom level, considerably within the last month.</p>

<p>Miners&rsquo; Arms Hotel. We have seen the plans for the new Miners&rsquo; Arms Hotel. The old building stands back 28&rsquo; from the frontage to which the new hotel will be brought. The old cellars and as much of the assembly room as were uninjured by the recent fire will be worked into the new one which will consist of a basement, first floor and second floor. The height of the top of the front will be 47&rsquo;. A balcony will run around the front and part of each end, accessed by French windows. A lift is included. Upstairs will hold 21 bedrooms and two bathrooms. The bar entrance will be in the centre of the frontage and private and billiard room entrances over in each wing. The billiard room is to house two tables. [Obviously this was never constructed and the second floor wasn&rsquo;t added to what was built until about 30 years later.]</p>

<p>Artesian Wells. The public meeting at the Institute on 2 May was chaired by the Mayor, Dr Nesbitt. The Mayor stressed the importance of such sources in times of drought and also because surface water was neither good nor healthy for man. W.H. Rosman jnr moved `That the late dry season has demonstrated the fallacy of depending on reservoirs or surface dams for a permanent supply of water.&rsquo; Kapunda was contemplating spending £50,000 to get a water supply. Boring wells would be more economical. Carried W.R. Ridgway moved a motion which urged the Govt. to make trials of artesian wells in the settled districts. Lessees should have sufficient inducement to test supplies to 10,000 gallons per day with compensation if the land was resumed.</p>
<p>Dr Stephens also spoke in support of the system. He thought the eastern Hundreds were as good as the land to the south or north: all that was required was water. Ridgway&rsquo;s motion was also carried.</p>
<p>A committee was elected and empowered to advance the cause by deputation or otherwise.</p>

<p>Letter to Editor from Edward Lipsett re the Burra Corporation and the Mayor. He wrote to say he believed that at the municipal elections last December he felt he was not served by ratepayers with fairness. Subsequent actions of Council had confirmed this.</p>
<p>When he left the chair the Corporation was in a healthy state with no debt and incoming rates free to do the work needed. He had used his casting vote when assuming office to see Mr Holder elected as Town Clerk. This action, he said, gave serious offence in some quarters and in no small degree tended to lessen the number of votes polled in his favour. Mr Holder&rsquo;s subsequent actions confirmed his trust in his appointment.</p>
<p>The actions of the present Mayor have resulted in the very serious circumstances which have befallen the Council and are the result of the Mayor&rsquo;s inexperience in business. He has failed to supervise the Clerk - the idea of allowing the Town Clerk to keep the sum of £49 in his cash box. In Lipsett&rsquo;s term of office the Clerk banked everything over £10. The Mayor&rsquo;s incompetence was shown right at the start when he gave a casting vote in favour of an amendment that nullified his first vote. Through his neglect the Council has lost between £300 and £400 of Govt. subsidy. Look at the bridge opening. Lipsett says that he and the first Mayor [P. Lane] `worked hard to get that splendid structure, and it stands today a great memorial to our labours.'</p>
<p>`We have a right to the credit.&rsquo; It deserved an opening worthy of a corporate town. (This, he said, was not angling for re-election as Mayor as he wouldn&rsquo;t accept the job at £1,000 p.a.</p>
<p>Letter from `Enquirer&rsquo; also asks why there has been no opening ceremony for the bridge. The Editor says: -</p>
<p>The work is incomplete and the bridge not really safe for traffic until the wing walls on the approaches are finished.</p>
<p>The surveyor in charge opened the bridge to traffic without informing Council.</p>

<p>Burra Amateur Dramatic Society entertainment in aid of the Burra Hospital was a great success last night. There was a large house. [Performers included Misses Fuss, E. Fuss &amp; Mr Fuss. This was probably Bertha and Elvine, though the latter would have been just under 12 years old. His later activities suggest the Mr Fuss was probably Charles August.]</p>
<p>Burra Town Council. The Mayor reported that upon the late Town Clerk not producing a statement of account as required by law, auditors had gone over the books and the late Clerk was brought to court and after being remanded was given an opportunity to obtain money, £47 odd being admitted short. A distress warrant was issued and if that did not produce enough he would be imprisoned. It is almost certain the sum will be obtained and the loss to the Council will not exceed £3.</p>
<p>It has been discussed that the Corporation has no title to the land on which the new bridge has been erected and the Town Clerk has written to SAMA to ask them to convey the land. Applications for the position of Town Clerk have been received form Messrs J. Roach, Opie, Motley &amp; Holder.</p>

The admission that Lipsett and his predecessor used their keys to go into the Clerk&rsquo;s books without his knowledge sounds mean and unmanly. Under these circumstances, in the event of a deficiency, the Clerk might accuse the Mayor of the theft. As for the bridge opening, I understand Dr Nesbitt received no notice and I fail to see why he should rush around to spend £100 for no good purpose. Mr Lipsett&rsquo;s refusal to subscribe to the hospital savours of meanness and I an also afraid he lacks discretion.</p>

<p>Editorial on Constitutional Reforms which contains the following somewhat surprising statement: -</p>
<p>`&hellip; we hope that democracy will never have unlimited rule for we are satisfied that the best possible form of Government is a despotic one, always provided that the despot is imbued with uprightness and justice. Self-government is no government and the only reason for allowing the people to assist in the work of government is that a community for very selfishness and self-seeking is less likely to perpetuate (and too fickle to constantly maintain) a system of misrule, than an evil disposed despot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The writer also appears to favour an appointed Upper House over an elected one.</p>

<p>Redruth Wesleyan anniversary was a decided success on Sunday &amp; Monday last. Despite wet weather the tea was well attended and the chapel was well filled for the public meeting. The debt was £500 and £60 was raised. The trustees expect to pay off £50 while meeting interest and current expenses.</p>
<p>Cornish Relief Fund. On Friday night the meeting in the Institute established a committee and divided the town into 5 districts with two canvassers in each. They will report back in a fortnight.</p>
<p>Burra Athletic &amp; Football Clubs&rsquo; Entertainment on Monday evening was well presented and much appreciated by the very small audience that attended due to the inclement weather. The Mintaro Brass Band played during the evening.</p>
<p>Inquest at the Pig and Whistle Hotel before J.D. Cave JP into the destruction by fire of the shop of Mr Joseph Dunstan on Saturday evening. Mr Dunstan was in the shop serving on Saturday evening at 7.30 p.m. and all was well. Two kerosene lamps were over each counter. Went to bed down the horses about 50 yds away. Was away about five minutes when my wife called out that the shop was on fire. Was unable to enter the shop and ran next door to my house adjoining the shop. Got one child from bed and a box from the room. Mrs Dunstan took the other child. Tried to get to the desk and till. [Apparently failed.] The dwelling and contents were saved. The wind was from the house to the store. There was a 16 year unexpired lease on a freehold to SAMA. The stock and house were insured: the stock for £400 and the furniture for £100. Don&rsquo;t know how the fire started. Heard no explosion. The lamps were trimmed and filled that afternoon. Stand to lose £200 over and above the insurance.</p>
<p>Mrs Dunstan said her husband called to her when he went out. Would have heard a person enter the shop. Heard a crash and found the drapery side of the shop ablaze. Called my husband. Believe the noise was the lamp over the drapery counter bursting, but could see nothing but fire. The lamp could not have fallen down.</p>
<p>Charles Rawling helped remove furniture from the house and the fire was contained to the shop. Even a fire engine would not have saved the shop.</p>
<p>Verdict: the fire was caused by the bursting of a kerosene lamp and was accidental.</p>
<p>Redruth Court 23 May.</p>
<p>Gully v. Lynch &amp; Lynch v. Gully</p>
<p>This was a case of cross actions for assault between two women living in tents at Hallett. [Most likely in connection with the railway extension to Terowie.] The argument was over a pig. Susan Godfrey was a witness for Mrs Lynch and evidently supported the latter&rsquo;s evidence of disgusting language used by Gully and also that she had thrown clods of earth at</p>
<p>Lynch. Gully was fined 10/- + cost to a total of 44/-. The counter charge was dismissed for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Burra Amateur Athletic Club held its third meeting on Monday at Copperhouse in Coles &amp; Goodchild&rsquo;s paddock. The weather was wet and cold in the morning, improving a little by noon and during the afternoon some 300 people gathered. The start of the games was delayed from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. by the weather. The Moonta Band played and cabs ran to and fro. The sport went smoothly except when the crowd startled a trooper&rsquo;s during the running of the hurdles and it turned into the path of the runners, knocking over Brady and Freeman, two of the leading three men. The judges upheld a protest from Brady, but Camp and Freeman, the other two leaders, declined to run, [again] handing Brady an easy win. The events are reported and the prizes and results listed. Eight horsemen entered the tilting.</p>

<p>The Hallett Railway, which was unfinished when the line opened so that the cost would not exceed the Engineer&rsquo;s estimates, is now being ballasted and presumably the cost will be charged to maintenance.</p>
<p>The Bank of Australasia in Kooringa is now occupied. The manager&rsquo;s residence lies behind the banking chamber and is convenient, but neither large nor of many rooms. The contractors were Sara &amp; Dunstan. The architect was Mr. McLagan and the cost £1,620.</p>
<p>Terowie Railway. The men on the Hallett-Terowie railway are earning 5/- to 6/- a day. Only new immigrants are employed and they complain that they get no money or means to get food till they have worked three days when an order is given them for food at the Hallett store.</p>

<p>Hallett Institute. The second entertainment to raise money for it was held on Tuesday. Mr Holder presided and announced that a contract had been let to Sara &amp; Dunstan for the construction of the building for £774. The entertainment ended with the farce, `Which Shall I Marry'.</p>
<p>Market Square Well. A meeting was held at the Institute on Tuesday afternoon with Dr Nesbitt in the chair. Mr F.W. Holder explained he had obtained information from Mr Miller of Francis Clark &amp; Sons and a suggestion of an offer to bore in Market Square. It seems clear no water supply from the Govt. is possible without a general rate and therefore local action is a better proposition with the revenue going to the Corporation. The evidence of water in the Mine suggests a well in Market Square would strike water at 200-300&rsquo;. He proposed that 1/2 the cost be met by the Govt. through the Council with&rsquo;/4 from SAMA and 1/4 by public subscription. The Corporation must be applied to at the next meeting. Sir Henry Ayers had been written to and private subscriptions of £70 were already promised.</p>
<p>Cost of boring: - 50&rsquo; £12-10-0 100&rsquo; £37-10-0</p>
<p>150&rsquo; £75- 0-0 200&rsquo; £125- 0-0</p>
<p>250&rsquo; £187-10-0 300&rsquo; £262-10-0</p>
<p>The discussion generally approved this scheme since the Govt. plan would cost £800 plus the cost of maintaining the pumping engine etc. The bore would be cheaper and would belong to the town. SAMA has since promised £25.</p>
<p>Gold in payable quantities has been found at Outalpa.</p>

<p>Editorial. The death of Mrs Statton after six days illness, which the jury said was brought on by stones thrown on her roof, came only a week after her marriage. This seems to have been a development of the reprehensible custom of `tin-kettling&rsquo; so frequently kept up in this town. It is absurd and a nuisance and at anytime might be productive of a great mischief.</p>
<p>Mr Rounsevell has left the colony and we assumed he left his resignation behind him, but evidently not. We find Parliament assembled again and Mr Rees to do all the representing for the Burra District. Unless Mr Rounsevell returns very soon the vacancy should be declared and an election held as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Post Office. Postal services are not good enough. There is one delivery a day in Kooringa, but none in Redruth. The mail cart goes to the railway four times a day, but only takes mail to Redruth twice. Redruth should get mail to and fro whenever the mail cart goes to the station. Redruth and Aberdeen should have a delivery every afternoon and Kooringa a second delivery at c.9.00 a.m.</p>
<p>Obituary/Inquest, on 16 June, before J.D. Cave JP into the death of Annie Statton.</p>
<p>Edward Statton, husband: - Was married 5 June and went to Adelaide, returning on 9 June and after a cup of tea with his mother they went to visit hers. Went to bed between 10.30 and 11.00 and after about 15 minutes a sound like 40-50 stones landing on the roof cause my wife to leap right off the bed. I tried to laugh it off, but she was trembling till morning. In the morning she took a little brandy and hot water and her mother came to stay while I went to work. She stayed at her mother&rsquo;s on Tuesday night, but couldn&rsquo;t sleep. On Wednesday sent for Dr Sangster, but there was little change till Friday. On Sunday I left home at 9.00 a.m. and returned about 12.00, when my mother-in-law said Annie was dying. Both Dr Sangster and Dr Nesbitt came in the afternoon and Annie died between 12.00 and 1.00 a.m. that night.</p>
<p>Dr Sangster: - On my first visit I found the deceased suffering from a nervous headache, but did not think the case serious. When I visited with Dr Nesbitt we did not see anything to indicate danger. The post mortem disclosed a large clot in the brain. Dr Nesbitt: - Could not attribute the clot to anything but violent emotion. Verdict was death by apoplexy caused by a sudden shock received on the night of 9 June from stones thrown on the roof by a person or persons unknown. A verdict of manslaughter is recorded against such unknown person or persons. [Born Ann Ellery 25 July 1857 District of Burra: died 16 June 1879 Kooringa.]</p>

<p>The Brands Act of 1879 was discussed at a meeting at the Burra Institute on 18 June with Dr Nesbitt in the chair. T. Warnes moved that the Brands Act was in the main suitable and should be given a year&rsquo;s trial, during which any problems would become patent. Much of the very loud agitation came from places where few animals were kept. Branding was not compulsory under the Act, only if it were used the brand must be registered. The discussion generally supported the Act.</p>

On 19 June he complained of ague which he had had for some time and he thought an attack was imminent, but it was not serious. He was a bit down, but saw nothing to suggest he was about to destroy himself The following morning a servant heard some moaning and went up and found he had cut his throat and was dead. He left a suicide note which is printed, but offers no real explanation beyond: -`Life has no pleasure for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The New Church - St Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>For some time it has been contemplated to supersede the old church which is falling into decay. The site was obtained in a commanding position between Kooringa and Aberdeen. Plans were prepared by Mr McLagan who has just carried out the Bank of Australasia. The contract was let to Sara &amp; Dunstan for the sum of £2,800. The total cost with excavation etc. is estimated at £3,000. Over 300 people assembled on 3 July to see the laying of the memorial stone despite the poor state of the streets due to recent rain. At about 3.30 p.m. the Bishop and clergy headed by Mr Boult and three choristers came to the platform and Bishop Augustus Short, 1st Bishop of the Diocese of SA, laid the stone in the 32nd year of his episcopate. The offering laid on the stone was £37-0-8. Rev. Henry Howitt spoke of the need for a new church, given the poor state of the old building. Tea followed and in the evening a concert which saw the hall uncomfortably crowded.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor from Robert Sanders, Cooper&rsquo;s Creek, Gippsland, Victoria, 23 June 1879. He endorses the idea of boring for water to supply Kooringa. He warns of the possibility of missing water even though close to a supply. The eastern side of the Mine he says is full of water at shallow depths and fully 1,000 gallons a minute was constantly entering the Mine from the east and to the north of the stable yard. He believes it would be injudicious to place the bore west of the Burra Creek. [Mainly because he thought that if the Mine was reopened and unwatered the well would go dry.] His favoured site would be near Mr Symons&rsquo; fence above the springs on the cemetery creek. [He then gives geological data to support his reasons for that site.]</p>
<p>He also says that in the early part of March 1878 he had taken the levels with the object of advocating making a reservoir to collect and preserve the water from the spring which is level with the lower corner of the fence around Mr Lipsett&rsquo;s dwelling and conveying it in pipes to inhabitants on the west of the Burra Creek (those to the west having easy access to shallow wells). If the mine restarts the west side of Burra creek will be drained dry.</p>

<p>Burra Town Council 7 July.</p>
<p>The site has been selected in Market square for the bore.</p>
<p>The Mayor had met with the Town Clerk and Captain Killicoat and Mr Richardson at Llwchwr and arranged for the new road and plans had been prepared, but now it seems Mr Cooke MP will object on behalf of the E &amp; A Copper Co. so it will have to be given up. [Presumably this refers to the Smelts Road.]</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway asked if the town had ever had the various reserves in the town formally handed over to its control. The Mayor did not think so.</p>
<p>Water tabling has been completed as ordered except for some in Market Square - which has been delayed by building operations. Also continuing around the Bank of Australasia in Aberdeen, at Ayers St and near Broad&rsquo;s [i.e. the Aberdeen Hotel] and the water trough.

<p>The wall at the extension of the cemetery is completed.</p>
<p>Messrs J. Sampson jnr, J. Williams &amp; J. Snell formed a deputation to Council seeking a remedy for the bad state of Market Square. About 30 loads of stone would be needed and drainage would be easy.</p>
<p>The Midland Road Board has agreed to pay half the cost of the approaches from side roads to main roads in the municipality provided the work was approved by their surveyor. Cr Ridgway moved that the Town Clerk be instructed to get all public lands and parts of creeks within the boundaries of the Corporation vested in the Council. Several reserves and pieces of land along the banks of the creek were public land, but the Council had no authority over them. Carried.</p>

<p>2nd Leader on Improvements Needed in Railway Management.</p>
<p>With a sidelight on the problems of the Daviestown Station: passengers getting off there must go to the brake-van the station before and clamber down from there. [The context implies a lack of a platform.] Passengers joining there reverse the performance. They also have to pay the fare to the next station (or if getting on there, the fare from the previous station).</p>
<p>Passengers from Hallett who want to join the morning train from Burra have to start at 6.30 a.m. and ride in the guard&rsquo;s van to Burra. Often this means standing all the way for 18 miles and sometimes standing on the external platform of the van. Surely a small passenger carriage is in order here.</p>
<p>Market Square Well. Work started on Monday and the borers unexpectedly struck solid rock at only seven feet.</p>
<p>Mail. A fortnight ago an extra mail run was established between Kooringa and Redruth each day and from Monday last a morning mail delivery has been made in Kooringa.</p>

<p>Excitement at Copperhouse.</p>
<p>A mad cow attacked Mr John Pearce and his spring cart at Copperhouse when he was on his way to Gum Creek on 17 July. The cow charged the cart and was then shot, but continued to attack until an Enfield rifle was obtained and four bullets were lodged in the brute before she was killed. The whole incident was drawn out over 2-3 hours.</p>

<p>Obituary. Captain Robert Sanders, late of the Burra Mines and since Manager of one of the largest copper mines in Gippsland, Victoria. A telegram from Walalla [perhaps Walhalla?] to P. Lane JP yesterday said the Captain had died the previous night. We had heard of his serious illness, but had hoped he would recover to visit some of his family members still in Burra. He was very favourably known here, not only for his work for SAMA, but in his civic role as one of the first Town Councillors for Middle Ward. He took great interest in the Hospital and Institute and in the Masonic Lodge. He leaves a widow, a daughter, and several sons. His last act in connection with Burra was a letter on the water supply question which appeared in the Record a fortnight ago.</p>

<p>Editorial on the move to open reading rooms and libraries on Sundays from 1.00 p.m. to sunset. This is opposed for religious reasons by some, but for the editor the greater problem would seem to be the denial of the day off for those employed at such places.</p>
<p>Copperhouse School. Copperhouse people have sent a memorial representing the interests of c.40 children and asking for the opening of a school at Copperhouse. The Minister expressed his support subject to the approval of the Burra School Board of Advice which we hear has opposed it on the grounds that the Burra School has plenty of room. The editor opposes this argument on the grounds that by road it is about four miles to the Burra School and half the children are under 10 years of age. If no school is opened at Copperhouse many of these children will not get any education at all. Furthermore the matter is entirely outside the jurisdiction of the Burra School Board which should never have become involved.</p>
<p>Burra School. Apparatus for teaching gymnastics has been supplied to the Burra and other public schools.</p>
<p>Snow was visible last Sunday on Sugarloaf and longer in some sheltered spots.</p>
<p>Hallett Celebrations. A coach will leave Hallett for Burra after the concert next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Market Square Well. The boring proceeds very slowly and has reached 20-30 feet. It has struck water. Steam power will soon be applied and then progress will be more rapid.</p>
<p>Lynch Family Bellringers had a splendid house on Saturday last and were well received. They will perform again on their way south in four weeks.</p>
<p>Football. The match scheduled for 6 August in Austin&rsquo;s paddock will be the first played in Burra and while Burra was badly defeated by Clare at Clare in the last match we expect a closer contest this time after practice. Burra will play in scarlet and black.</p>

<p>Copperhouse School. A memorial is being prepared for the Burra School Board of Advice urging them to reconsider their late decision re the Westbury School. [This is presumably the same as the Copperhouse School.]</p>

<p>Redruth Bridge. The work of erecting the structure has at last begun.</p>
<p>Redruth Quarry. [?] There was an accident last Tuesday in which Mr Jos. Williams was buried in a sudden fall of rocks and earth. He was extricated with a broken leg and several broken ribs and remains in a precarious state.</p>
<p>A Bolt. The horses in Dr Nesbitt&rsquo;s buggy bolted on Sunday. The boy holding the reins jumped out and they dashed off to Mr Coglin&rsquo;s, turned out of the road and tipped the trap over on a bank. Little damage was done.</p>
<p>Football. The match on Wednesday in Austin&rsquo;s paddock resulted in a draw. Burra 1.11 and Clare 1.4 [At this time points were recorded, but did not count in determining the result.]</p>
<p>Burra Youths&rsquo; Athletic Sports gained a fair attendance at their meeting in Austin&rsquo;s paddock. Winners are published.</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodist dinner and concert passed off very well last Wednesday. About 80 stayed on for the supper afterwards and the proceeds were £21.</p>
<p>Rev. Green&rsquo;s lecture and entertainment on Monday went fairly well despite the poor weather.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council 4 August.</p>
<p>Messrs Pearce Sen., Ward &amp; Bruce asked the Council to enlarge the waterway of the bridge in Queen St as the man road bridge upstream has been enlarged. Council thought the whole bridge would soon have to be replaced, but they had no money at present. The deputation offered to lower the bed at their own cost and was allowed to do so under the supervision of the surveyor.</p>
<p>Discussion re a cheque for £12 misappropriated by the late Town Clerk (Mr J. Fogg) - some steps had been taken and Council would have to decide on what to do next - deferred to next meeting.</p>
<p>The Overseer&rsquo;s report was that Market Square needed to be much raised and the hollows filled in before it can be thoroughly drained. Already over 70 yards [3] of quarry rubble have been carted there.</p>
<p>Two approaches to the bridge in Aberdeen are to be made.</p>
<p>Expenditure on public works has been just over £1,000 for the year and the cemetery fund has been repaid £156. Indebtedness is now a little less than on 1 January, but no further works are to take place except those already ordered.</p>

<p>Market Square Well. Boring has stopped pending the erection of new steam powered boring apparatus. Delays were caused by the unexpected appearance of rock at 8&rsquo; which turned to hard blue sandstone at 24&rsquo;. Considerable detail is given: rods and chisels were used at first and in the hard rock the American system of boring with a strong rope. Details next issue.</p>
<p>Redruth Bridge is now closed for the erection of the new structure.</p>

<p>Editorial on the Copperhouse school question. When the question about it came up in Parliament the Minister of Education replied that the local Board of Advice advised it was unnecessary and so the Govt. would take no action. The second petition to the Board seems to have been ignored. The editor is amazed and distressed at the decision of the Board and at their lack of sympathy. A provisional school could be established as there are buildings available and this would test the numbers available.</p>
<p>Redruth Bridge. The girder for the bridge which fell when being loaded in the railway yard has been rebuilt. The delay is to be regretted.</p>
<p>Burra School. Miss Ranking has been transferred from Burra to the City Model School and Miss Kilkelly comes in her place. Mr J. Snell, formerly of Burra is now at Kapunda as assistant.</p>
<p>Cornwall Relief Fund. The local appeal has raised £60-3-6.</p>
<p>The Season. Crops to the north and north-west are good, but growth has been slow due to low temperatures. To the east growth is faster and looking well. To the south growth is backward and warmth needed.</p>
<p>New Hundreds.</p>
<p>County Burra, Hundred 280 lies to the east of H. of Mongolata and north of the H. of King. It comprises grassed open saltbush and bluebush with some sandalwood and mallee.</p>
<p>[It was proclaimed the H. of Rees on the 18 September 1879: named after Rowland Rees MP 1840-1904.]</p>
<p>County Burra, Hundred 281 lies north of H. of Mongolata and south of the H. of Wonna and east of the H. of Hallett. 1/4 is rough scrubby country and the rest open saltbush and bluebush. The plains areas are fairly grassed.</p>
<p>[It was proclaimed the H. of Tomkinson on the 18 September 1879: named after Samuel Tomkinson MLC, a member of the Upper House from 1885-1900 and manager of the Bank of Australasia in Adelaide.]</p>
<p>Midland Road Board. Mr Woollacott has been awarded the contract for the completion of the Redruth Bridge: to be done by 30 November.</p>

<p>Redruth Bridge. `Observer&rsquo; writes objecting to the editor&rsquo;s comment that all teams would have to detour through Kooringa while the Redruth Bridge was constructed. The White Hart ford allowed them to bypass the problem and why was no equivalent suggestion made in reverse when the Kooringa Bridge was under construction, despite the steeper gradient at the Kooringa ford?</p>
<p>[This letter is another example of north-south rivalry in the town.]</p>

<p>Editorial on government grants-in-aid.</p>
<p>Redruth Bridge. We understand Mr Woollacott has decided not to sign the contract for the Redruth bridge which will delay it another month.</p>
<p>Copperhouse School. Apparently the local Board of Advice has not met to consider the petition from the Copperhouse parents, but will do so today. At least two members seem to favour a school for Copperhouse so a change is possible. Further detail of the Parliamentary question of Mr Rees is printed in which he says the surrounding district had only just been opened up to agriculture as far as Baldry and Irontown [sic] [Presumably Iron Mine] and at present only one child from Copperhouse attended school in Burra. There was, he said, considerable difficulty in getting into Burra in the wet season. The place was within a six mile radius, but that was a discretionary matter as other examples showed: Yarcowie for example was within six miles of two other schools.</p>
<p>Adelaide Institute reading room and the Museum were open last Sunday afternoon for the first time and there was a large attendance.</p>

<p>Drew &amp; Co. A new shop for Drew &amp; Co. will be erected on the site of the present shop which will be incorporated into the new work and the whole will be of a commodious and elegant character.</p>
<p>New Buildings. The restored Miners&rsquo; Arms Hotel is almost complete and a new shop in Commercial St for Mr John Jenkin is in hand. The new church is making rapid progress.</p>
<p>Railway. Why is there no proper refreshment facility or waiting room at the Burra Railway Station?</p>
<p>Bible Christian Church. Special services were held last Sunday with a tea-meeting Monday. There were good congregations.</p>
<p>II. 61. 29 August 1879 Page 3</p>
<p>Redruth Primitive Methodist special services in aid of circuit funds last Sunday and Monday. An open-air service at 5.30 p.m. was attended by c. 100 and the evening chapel service was crowded. Proceeds from the services and tea-meeting were £11.</p>
<p>Show Society Ploughing Match on Wednesday last in Ohlmeyer&rsquo;s paddock near Kooringa attracted only moderate interest. There were no entries in the youth&rsquo;s class. Thomas Bailey won the double plough class (£7); with 2&quot;d prize to Thomas Fairchild Jnr. George Bailey won the single plough class (£5); with 2nd prize to S.J. Myles. In the evening there was a dinner at the Commercial Hotel.</p>

<p>Editorial on colonial finances.</p>
<p>The Copperhouse School. From proceedings in Parliament it seems that the Burra School Board of Advice was unanimous in deciding against the establishment of a school at Copperhouse. Our information that the chairman and one other favoured it was apparently wrong. The Minister of Education is willing to yield, but finds it difficult in light of a reiteration of the Board&rsquo;s view on Wednesday. This is extreme blindness on the part of the Board.</p>
<p>Gladstone Gaol. Sara &amp; Dunstan have started work.</p>
<p>Wesleyan Entertainment at the Sunday-schoolroom on Wednesday was a great success. The program was good and well rendered.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council. The Council agreed to the location of a weighbridge for J.W. White. The misappropriation of a cheque for £12 by Mr Fogg was discussed and finally the matter placed in the hands of the solicitor with power to act.</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway endorsed the Council&rsquo;s joining the Association of Municipal Corporations, but suggested it be deferred to the new council as they currently had no money and the joining fee was £5-5-0.</p>
<p>He also moved that the £100 standing to the credit of the Cemetery be invested in Corporation bonds.</p>

<p>Ulooloo. A party of men have begun sinking on the Ulooloo goldfield to find the quartz reef. Some ten years ago gold was discovered and much alluvial gold was taken, but shortage of water was a problem. And also the reef was not found, though veins of quartz were not hard to discover.</p>
<p>Letter to Editor from <code>Ratepayer' who notes that the Town Council's funds have been expended, but he wonders whether they have been well spent. In North Ward at least, he says, the answer must be no. A walk down the east side of Broad's Hotel - or as it might be dubbed </code>Ridgway&rsquo;s Road&rsquo; would demonstrate the point. The Corporation has spent £70 to divert traffic from the main road (which is maintained by the Road Board) down this to effect a saving in distance cannot exceed 70 yards. In any case it did not have to be done this year as at present the bridge is closed for reconstruction. Incidentally, the exclusion of clay from footpath material would improve them greatly as recent rains have proved!</p>

<p>2nd Leader on the new Main Roads Act. Among others, struck off the list of main roads were Kooringa to Govt. Wells. Added to the list were Robertstown to Burra Railway Station, section 43W H. of Baldina to Government Well, Foot of Breakneck Hill to section 150 H. of Baldina, Kooringa to Diprose Creek via Nankivell&rsquo;s Gully, Mt Bryan Railway Station to Mongolata (what part thereof is not stated), Burra Station to Leighton. If the Mt Bryan to Mongolata road turns out to be the White Hill route we think the line inferior to the one from Breakneck to Caroona.</p>
<p>Accident. The Blinman coach had an accident at Yatina on its last trip and it was feared that driver Wills had broken his leg, but Dr Nesbitt went to Hallett and found it was not so.</p>
<p>Rev. Howitt is not recovered from his accident yet and a clergyman will be sent from Adelaide to officiate at St Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Auctions. Liston Shakes &amp; Co. has sold over 20,000 sheep this month in Burra.</p>
<p>Football. Mr Bentley has offered to take a photo of the Burra footballers on Saturday afternoon at his residence at 3.00 p.m. so they are requested to meet there.</p>
<p>Midland Road Board.</p>
<p>Mr Woollacott declined to sign the contract for the Redruth Bridge and sought the return of his deposit. [He appears to cite an error in his tender of £230 as his reason, but this is not entirely clear from the report.] The Board resolved to place him on a blacklist for 12 months and to try to keep his deposit. The next best tenderer was Duncan Grant who accepted the contract when it was offered him.</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat reported that the culvert opposite the Roman Catholic school had diverted water and endangered the foundations. He advised a wall be constructed 20&rsquo; long on condition the Corporation take it over when built. In Market Square he recommended 6 chains of road be made nearer the frontages. The surveyor is to inspect, prepare plans and present estimates by the next meeting.</p>

<p>Letter to Editor from `Observer&rsquo; asserting that supposedly cheaper butter at Gladstone was 4-5 oz short of the pound when weighed and as butter went down in price 8d or 9d a pound in the week concerned [at Burra presumably] Gladstone cannot really beat Burra.</p>
<p>Letter complaining about the nature of the `so-called&rsquo; children&rsquo;s entertainment at the Institute last Saturday. As many as a third of parents would have kept their children away had they known the nature of the affair. The writer also objects to the affair being promoted by the public school which apparently handed out vouchers that entitled holders to get in for 6d. The editor agrees on the latter point. [The real nature of the complaint is not specified.]</p>

<p>SAMA has declared a dividend of 10/- a share: the first dividend declared for 7 years.</p>
<p>Market Square Well. The well boring in Market Square continues to average 5 to 6 ft per day. There is an abundance of water in the well from c. 15&rsquo; from the surface.</p>
<p>Main Road. The new main road declared from Mt Bryan Station really extends only as far as Mt Bryan East P.O. The Baldina to Mongolata Road has been added to the list.</p>
<p>Entertainment. The church concert by Mr Plaisted was fairly well attended at the Institute and his playing was admired. The organ was a parlour Standard Organ which, though of a sweet tone, was not equal to the size of the hall.</p>
<p>The Musical Union Concert at the Institute on Wednesday in aid of Institute funds had a very large audience and was a great success.</p>
<p>Burra Show.</p>
<p>Good weather saw about 2,000 attend. Despite recent bad seasons the stock was good, but implement yards were bare - or nearly so: 2 reapers, a single, a double and a multiple plough, one set of harrows and a seed sower. Four nice buggies were shown by C.A. Kruger of Adelaide. G.A. Gebhardt did particularly well with Longwools and E. &amp; C.W. Bowman with Merinos. Horses were good and dogs very good this year. But cattle were poor. Flowers, fruit and vegetables were better, but require better presentation. Dairy produce and poultry were excellent, with the latter much improved.</p>

<p>Aberdeen Hotel. On 15 October Broad&rsquo;s Aberdeen Hotel was destroyed by fire. A number of railway workmen under Mr Mather prevented the fire spreading elsewhere.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council.</p>
<p>The Town Clerk is to apply for a road to the cemetery and along its western side and also for the banks of the creek from opposite the school to the new bridge, for tree planting. Cr Ridgway moved that steps be taken for the sale of all property on which rates had not been paid. Cr Geake moved an amendment that it be postponed till legal advice re costs had been obtained. Both motion and amendment were lost.</p>
<p>Cr Drew moved the Town Clerk take advice as necessary for the sale of vacant lands on which the rates remained unpaid.</p>
<p>It was resolved that Captain Killicoat be charged £3 per acre plus expenses for the piece of closed road to be sold to him.</p>
<p>Letter to Editor from `Honesty&rsquo; complaining that the Burra Show has seen prizes awarded for flowers that were brought in from Adelaide, but were exhibited as grown within 20 miles of Burra. If this cannot be tested or exhibitors are unable to see the dishonesty involved then let there be no prizes for flowers.</p>
<p>Inquest at Aberdeen on Thursday into the fire on Wednesday that consumed Broad&rsquo;s Aberdeen Hotel. J.D. Cave, coroner and D. Wells, foreman of the jury.</p>
<p>John Broad: - Was home all-day and slept the night in a downstairs room facing onto the main road. All other lodgers and servants had gone to bed and all seemed quiet and safe. About 2.00 a.m. heard some crackling as of the lighting of a fire and thought it was the ostler who always lit the fire. Woke Mrs Broad and said the ostler was lighting the fire and it was not yet time. She went to the kitchen, but came back and said that all upstairs was on fire and I was to get up. Got up and called the men. Saw flames from upper windows. Found the servant girl lying on the ground. She said she had jumped from the window. Sent for the police and then took out what furniture we could. The assembly room was saved, and the roof on the outer rooms was taken off to stop the fire. Am only a tenant, but the furniture and stock was insured for £1,000 and the premises for £1,500. When I got outside flames were coming from three windows. Two of the [upper] rooms were occupied. Think the fire started in the centre rooms. One window did for two rooms which were divided by a lath and plaster partition and occupied by a servant and a lodger respectively. Ann Broad: - Supported her husband&rsquo;s testimony. There were six rooms upstairs. Only two were occupied: by a lodger and the servant girl, Ophelia Johnstone. Saw the upper rooms on fire along the passage. The man who slept upstairs was not exactly sober. He had a candle and wax matches to light his pipe. There were curtains at the window, but the table was not near them.</p>
<p>The enquiry then adjourned to the hospital.</p>
<p>Ophelia Johnstone: - Went to bed at 11.30 p.m. Put candle on chair by bed and put it out once in bed. The man next door was then snoring. Was awakened by smoke and part of the room was aflame. The window was nailed down, but I broke the frame and got onto the verandah and jumped down. Fire could only have come from the next room as nowhere else was occupied. The man had been very free with his matches, throwing them down on the carpet before he went upstairs. I broke the window with my hand. While on the ground I saw the man come out on the verandah.</p>
<p>The enquiry then returned to Aberdeen.</p>
<p>Thomas Long, labourer: - Was on my way back to Farrell&rsquo;s Flat from Terowie after delivering sheep. Slept in the Aberdeen Hotel Tuesday night. Went to bed between 9.00 &amp; 10.00 p.m. Put the candle on the table by the bed. Blew out the light when I went to bed. Was awakened by smoke and heard a female scream and break the glass. Got onto the verandah. Tried to go back for my clothes etc., but couldn&rsquo;t. Was quite sober. I lost a watch, boots, rug, blanket and other small things.</p>
<p>Edmund Alexander Jeffrey passed the hotel at 1.30 a.m. and saw neither fire nor a light. Henry Walker lives nearby and saw fire coming from the hotel windows at about 3.00 a.m. There were several other witnesses including the police, but they added little of significance. While it was clear that suspicion clearly pointed at some action by Thomas Long there was no clear evidence and the verdict was that fire started in the upper storey, but there was no evidence to show how it originated.</p>

<p>Editorial. The Midland Road Board some time ago agreed to pay half the cost of making the approaches from side streets to the main roads in the town. The Corporation then went ahead on this undertaking and spent c. £100 and sent in an account for half the cost, or almost £50. The Board baulked at this total and seems to have cast about for an excuse not to pay. It referred the matter to its surveyor who has presented a most remarkable report to justify the Board&rsquo;s not paying. If there is any fault it lay in the Board&rsquo;s unconditional agreement to fund half the cost. The report accepts that four approaches are fair and will be paid for. It also says `the whole of the works have been well done&rsquo;. It then remarkably says that the road connecting two approaches between Broad&rsquo;s Hotel and the new Redruth Bridge is not finished or fit for traffic. It is fit for traffic, though no top metal has yet been spread, but that can be done anytime, now that the bog that existed there in winter has been removed. In any case it is their job to pay for the approaches and not the road. All the rest are dismissed as private approaches. This is nonsense and all but one lead directly to more than one house and in any event it is common for approaches to be made where no home is in sight. The question for the necessity of the streets lies with the Corporation. The surveyor has exceeded his duty by every word written. The Corporation will not do its duty unless it insists on the Board keeping its promise.</p>
<p>Rev. R.W. Campbell&rsquo;s lecture on Robert Burns was a success and the musical portion under Mr Loutit was also appreciated. Proceeds were £5.</p>
<p>The Entertainment listed for 27 October will now take place on 30 October.</p>
<p>Flowers. `We were last week passing Mr Fuss&rsquo; house in Llwchyr and were very much pleased to see the result that can be obtained by uniting labor combined with skill and taste. Flowers were in abundance and variety and fruit promises exceedingly well. Perhaps no prettier spot its size is to be found anywhere than that is a most unlikely place, even in Market-square, Kooringa, next to Messrs Drew and Co.&rsquo;s premises. It is surprising to see how much can be got into a small space and also to observe how healthy and hearty all the vegetable growth seems either in the forms of fruit or flowers or vegetable.'</p>
<p>Alcohol. Four men travelled from Morgan to Burra this week and near World&rsquo;s End one got away into the scrub on the `horrors&rsquo; from drink while all his companions did was to laugh. Mr Midwinter found him and brought him in to the Burra Hospital.</p>

<p>Letters to Editor.</p>
<p>William Jenkin writes re the Copperhouse school needs. The community there very much wants a school and in the absence of a Govt. one will turn to something else. A good-meaning young man has opened a school in the township and in less than a week has secured 32 students. Only 2 of these had been attending Burra school. The Board of Education virtually acknowledges the claims of Copperhouse by not calling on parents there to show cause why their children are not at school. The matter demands attention. The local Board, I am told, was asked just one or two questions and not to evaluate the whole case. Distances involved are a poor excuse. Wallaroo Mines has a school one mile from Kadina and Moonta Mines on a similar distance from Moonta. The new school near Iron Mine is 8-9 miles from Copperhouse and so is irrelevant.</p>
<p>W.R. Ridgway writes in support of his attempts recently to (a) get vacant blocks in town fenced, to help with tree planting and general improvement of appearances, and (b) to get vacant lots with unpaid rates sold.</p>

<p>Editorial on a Floricultural Society. A meeting on Friday of the Burra Agricultural Society (the Show Society) considered a flower show, but thought the Society was not strong enough to support a second show. This we think was a mistake. It is now a question of taking up the issue independently of the Ag. Society. If a show is to be held this year steps must be taken at once. The Institute would be a good place to hold such a show.</p>
<p>A meeting will be held in the Institute on Saturday afternoon at 2.00 p.m. to consider establishing a Floricultural Society.</p>
<p>Storm. There was a wild storm across the colony last Monday. It damaged many buildings and newly cut hay. Several roofs in Burra were damaged. Messrs Drew &amp; Co.&rsquo;s storefront was so shaken that it has since been taken down. Rain fell in sheets and the display of thunder and lightning frightened many.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council.</p>
<p>Mr Strike was granted a licence to slaughter small cattle at his premises in Bridge St.</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway&rsquo;s motion to cause the fencing of vacant land in Best Place, Morehead St and Ludgvan St was carried.</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway raised the issue of the Aberdeen railway crossing, saying it needed gates or some other warning device or a man with a red flag to make it safer.</p>
<p>The Govt. has indicated that there will be no payment made on some of the work done on the new bridge. Further application will be made.</p>
<p>Plans will be sent to SAMA and the Yorke&rsquo;s Peninsula Mining Association showing the reserves sought.</p>
<p>The Market Square Well. Further clarification on the boring difficulties. When some hard obstruction was found in the well it was conjectured that it was a piece of broken tubing, but the boring cable failed to communicate anything definite by sound or feel as is usual. Since sometimes days passed without detecting the problem it was then thought that hard stones might be falling down from higher in the tube. About a month ago the obstruction appeared to have cleared and drilling continued for 2 to 3 weeks at about 40&rsquo; per week till 194&rsquo; was reached. Here the obstruction was worse than ever. It was then that a careful observation of a point about 19&rsquo; from the top showed precisely where the broken piece came from. Some days were spent in a futile attempt to retrieve the piece and ultimately it was pushed aside and boring continued, but at 199'6&quot; it was found that the bore was out of plumb and the ground was too hard to allow it to be straightened. At this point the cable broke with the tools attached and some 60&rsquo; of it fell down the tube. They are now attempting to recover this. The orders from Adelaide are then to start a new bore some feet away with a 51⁄2&quot; diameter rather than the old 41⁄2&quot; size. This should make jamming of the tools less likely. This seems to be the best solution despite the probably loss of money to the company.</p>
<p>Burra Athletic Club. The fourth club meeting in Duff s paddock at Copperhouse last Monday started with a wet and boisterous morning, but by 11.00 a.m. the weather was improving and despite a strong wind events got under way at noon and in the afternoon there was a good number of spectators of both sexes. Results are printed. Prizes were distributed at the Institute in the evening.</p>
<p>Hallett Institute.</p>
<p>On Monday 10 November, despite the stormy weather the Hallett Institute was successfully opened. Mr Warwick donated the land in Alfred St. Plans had been prepared by Mr F.W. Holder for a hall 45&rsquo;x30&rsquo;x18&rsquo; high and two offices each 16&rsquo;xl2&rsquo; separated by a [word illegible, but it must be passage or foyer] 6&rsquo;x 16'</p>

<p>Sara &amp; Dunstan undertook the work for £778. A piano was purchased. One of the front rooms will serve as a reading room and library and the other as a Council Chamber. On Monday the opening was performed by Mr Rowland Rees MP and the key was handed to him by Mr R. Collins JP. A luncheon followed and then the Burra v. Hallett cricket match in which Hallett 82 defeated Burra 58. Mr Rowland Rees presided at the entertainment in the evening at which he also recited Poe&rsquo;s The Raven. The ball which followed lasted far into the morning. The activities raised £50 which would have been more, but for the weather. [Considerably more detail is given.]</p>
<p>Court Case. Three columns are devoted to the case in which Mrs Catherine Banks, the widow of the late owner of the Unicorn Brewery sued Mr Rosman, the manager of the National Bank, who had been authorised to wind up the estate and sell the brewery assets. It was a case in the Equity Court.</p>

<p>W. Peel Nesbitt writes denying he is likely to remove from Burra as Mr Pearce is made to state in the last issue.

<p>`One of the Public&rsquo; writes accusing Watson of allowing Corey to win in the champion race at the recent sports. In the 220 yds handicap Corey had a six yard start and Watson beat him easily.

<p>Midland Road Board 1 November.</p>
<p>Dr Nesbitt, Mayor of Burra, waited on the Board re the approaches to main roads in Burra which the Board had thought were private approaches. He pointed out that they were public streets and the Council was entitled to payment which had been claimed. He felt the report last meeting which said the Board felt that the Corporation had tried to `get at&rsquo; them was unfair. The Chairman said they would consider the matter and when visiting the town shortly would deal fairly with the Council.</p>

<p>The rate for the year was 1/- in the £ and the health rate 3d in the £. The health rate brought in £139-9-5 which was expended on the scavenger at 10/- a day, with satisfactory results. The ordinary rate brought in £559-17-9 (with a subsidy of £660-0-2) and the total income for the year was £1,916-12-10, of which £1,395-12-7 was spent on public works. At present there is a debit of £94, but there are expected receipts totalling £163, i.e. from the Govt. £84, from the Midland Road Board £40 and from purchasers of a road £29. [This total is actually £153 and the Govt. claim was at best doubtful.]</p>
<p>The main public work was the Kooringa [Kingston St] bridge which was supposed to be paid for by the Govt. but the superintending surveyor said there were insufficient funds so the Corporation had to expend £84 which we have endeavoured to recoup. (So far unsuccessfully) With the approach costs the bridge has cost us £394-5-10. The closing of the old ford led to the need to drain Market Square which has been commenced by watertabling both sides of Thames St, round the Square, both sides of Chapel St, Queen St and Commercial St and making a cross drain in Mt Pleasant St to turn water from the hill down Chapel St. We have begun to level Market Square from side to side. Other roads made include: - Bridge Terrace, part of Kingston St, Welsh Place, Ayers St and Chapel St as far as the creek. A footpath has been formed to the hospital and from near the National Bank to the Post Office. Merthyr St from the Aberdeen Hotel to the bridge has been made and other watertabling done in Aberdeen and Redruth. Many approaches to the main roads have been made because this is the last occasion on which the Road Board would pay a moiety. Council has closed the road from Mr Cave&rsquo;s to Roach Town and opened a direct road from Mr Fuss&rsquo;s [i.e. H.C.W. Fuss&rsquo;s in Llwchwr] to the same point.</p>
<p>The Town Clerk, Mr Fogg, was asked to resign after three months, in the face of repeated warnings. Immediate steps were taken to recover monies missing due to his neglect and all except £2 was recovered. His neglect caused a delay of 3 months in getting Govt. subsidy and a loss of £10 in interest and because work had been let in anticipation of income a£400 loan became necessary.</p>
<p>The Council let a contract to Messrs Francis Clark &amp; Sons for the artesian well in Market Square. If the public subscribe half the cost the Govt. will fund the rest. Owing to misadventure the first well has had to be abandoned and the second is now being bored.</p>
<p>On 9 June the Council declared Cr White&rsquo;s seat vacant and Mr Thomas Drew was elected in his place.</p>
<p>Council has decided to enforce the fencing of vacant land in Best Place, and in Ludgvan &amp; Morehead Sts.</p>
<p>The cemetery has been enlarged by a strip 100&rsquo; wide which has now been walled. The debt to the cemetery has been repaid and part spent on the alterations with the rest invested in Corporation bonds. The cemetery lost £12 by Mr Fogg&rsquo;s misdemeanour. The Midland road board has undertaken to deal fairly with the question of road approaches, but are not committed until they view them in a week or two. Dr Nesbitt then presented figures suggesting that in 1880 there should be c. £800 for public works which compares with £827-4-6 this year if we exclude the bridge expenditure. Mr Roberts wanted to know how the cemetery lost £ 12. At the time it was not clear how much was missing as there were no vouchers. [Apparently it was not clear whether it was simply vouchers that were missing, or whether money had been misappropriated. It then became clear that a £12 cheque had been misappropriated.] Mr Fogg was not worth as many shillings as there were pounds in the missing cheque so it was not worth the expense of prosecuting him. He has promised to repay it when able.</p>
<p>Mr Lipsett wondered if the loss was as little as £14 [i.e. £2 from the general funds and £12 from the cemetery funds] when he had heard it was much more. Dr Nesbitt said the loss was in fact confined to £14 in cash, but there was also a loss in interest of £10. Mr Lipsett asked the auditors to explain, before they sought re-election, why they had not found out the problems at the first instance. Mr Cave said that in going through the books they had found a certain sum not accounted for amounting to between £50 &amp;£60 and there were two items for which there were no vouchers.</p>
<p>II. 73. 21 November 1879 Page 3</p>
<p>[There was then further discussion on the missing money which had been gone for two months before being discovered.] The defalcations had occurred after the ordinary audit. The Mayors report was adopted.</p>
<p>Rev. W. Jenkin added a vote of thanks to the Mayor and Council. He admitted that he had last year been a political enemy of Dr Nesbitt, though in no other sense, but he had seen that Dr Nesbitt had attended most thoroughly to his duties and that the best course had been taken in the Fogg affair as further legal action would have just meant a loss for the town. He was grieved by the unemployment in the town in winter and did not know what many would have done but for the work provided by Council.</p>
<p>Dr Nesbitt thanked the meeting for the amicable way in which unpleasant aspects of the past year had been aired without rancour.</p>
<p>Mr Lane, candidate for Mayor was asked some questions: -</p>
<p>He would favour a footpath to Aberdeen when funds permitted. Was for a mortuary chapel at the cemetery.</p>
<p>Would favour cutting down the bank by the Institute, but it was not urgent and could wait till more pressing needs were attended to.</p>

<p>2nd Leader: on a successful municipal year. This was the first where real money could be spent on public works. Spending in earlier years was inhibited by various difficulties. Next year should do well with no heavy work like the Kingston St Bridge. It would be best for the new council to have a plan and to have a station man in each ward to attend to maintenance. One needed item is a bridge in Thames St to replace the present ford. Middle ward requires no provision for maintenance as apart from the main road and the one to the brewery there are as yet no made roads. There is abundant use for the money however, as in the formation of a road from Paxton Square to Redruth via the Smelting Works and a footpath from the Post Office to Aberdeen and one in Commercial St. Also the cutting down of the bank opposite the Institute.</p>

<p>A complaint about the Municipal elections. On 19 November Mr Geake was proposed and 2&quot;d at a meeting as a proper person to represent South Ward. Mr Ridgway said he would oppose Mr Geake&rsquo;s election and he went to Mr Geake and borrowed the book of the laws of the Corporation, whereupon Mr Geake withdrew from the election and South Ward lost the services of an upright, honest and straightforward man. Had Cr Ridgway let his opposition be known sooner we would have had a chance to nominate someone who knew more about municipal affairs than Mr Lewis does. `I wonder Mr Editor if Councillor Ridgway were weighed in the balance if he would be found wanting.</p>

<p>Editorial on Municipal Affairs.</p>
<p>Though it has not been the practice in Burra, it is desirable for the Mayor to be voted an allowance. It should be done at a time like the present when there is no question of the Mayor asking for it, or requiring it. Firstly, such a move would open up the position to men who might not otherwise be able to afford it and secondly, the representation of the town requires considerable outlay which should not be required of one who already gives freely of his time.</p>
<p>The decisions on expenditure this year are generally as we had suggested last week. In North Ward footpaths are to be formed from the railway gate to the Bank of Australasia in Aberdeen. In Middle Ward the unsightly banks near the Institute and in Commercial St will be cut down. As the road by the Institute is controlled by the Midland Road Board we hope they will see the advantage in raising one half and lowering the other half of the roadway to make a road in the centre and so share with the Corporation in improving the town. In South Ward the most important work is the erection of an iron bridge in Thames St. We think that Ayers St in South Ward, which leads to the cemetery, should be a cost to the town as a whole. The other two wards have the burden of main roads removed from them to the Midland Road Board, but in South Ward no such easing of the burden is made. Another, but less desirable solution would be to charge the cost to the cemetery fund. At present the town pays £140 p.a. for the police: one foot-policeman at either end. This being the case some consider that the North Ward should pay half and the other two wards should share the other half. This is to be resolved next meeting. We hope the Middle and South Wards will concede on this. Part of Middle Ward is closer to Redruth than Kooringa anyway.</p>
<p>We are glad to find that the Parklands in Redruth are to be formally placed under Corporation control, but regret that SAMA is not willing to dedicate the banks of the creek to the public as reserves so they might be planted and improved. Under uncertain tenure the Council will not commit ratepayers’ money to those areas and only public subscription can effect the improvements that are desirable.</p>

<p>A Bolt. On Saturday as Dr Sangster was driving through Aberdeen his horse was frightened by the steam engine at Sara &amp; Dunstan&rsquo;s and it bolted for home, passing through Aberdeen and Kooringa to his residence where the trap was overturned and the doctor and his groom thrown out. The doctor escaped with a shaking, but the groom, James Wooton, broke his leg. The horse then started off again and frightened a passing team, which also bolted briefly. Presently the horse was restrained and returned, but the buggy was greatly damaged.</p>

Then to the Bon Accord Hotel and past the Carrying Co. Office and thence the ordinary road to the front of Mr Diplock&rsquo;s house: a distance of 2 miles 71 chains 14 feet. It will be remembered that Mr Rees and others stated it to be 41⁄2 miles.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council 8 December.</p>
<p>The Mayor reported that the Midland Road Board would visit on 12 December and he had invited them to a banquet at 6.00 p.m.</p>
<p>Captain Killicoat was appointed to open the Redruth Bridge. [As the local representative on the Midland Road Board.]</p>
<p>Town Clerk reported the sum available for expenditure on public works will be £759.</p>
<p>The Mayor said he hoped in cutting the bank opposite the Institute the Road board would co-operate and reduce the road to one level along the centre. He favoured Ayers St being a general charge, and that the police charge should be half north and half south instead of equally between the three wards. This is to be resolved next meeting.</p>
<p>Other items of expenditure as in the editorial column, though Middle Ward will start the road from Paxton Square via the Smelting Works to Redruth and to form a footpath to the Mine Bridge.</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway gave notice via letter in his absence of the following motions: - 1. The Inspector also to be rate collector at a fixed salary.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>A man to be placed in charge of the cemetery at a salary and to act also as curator. 3. The Town Clerk to be also the Town Surveyor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two stationmen to be appointed from 1 February 1880 at £2 per week: one at either end of the town.</p>

<p>£50 as Clerk of Works</p>
<p>£10 as Curator of the Cemetery</p>
<p>£10 as Secretary of the Local Board of Health</p>
<p>Total (offer accepted) £120</p>
<p>The Inspector was offered £80 instead of £75, but with all court fees to go to the Corporation.</p>
<p>SAMA has conceded the land around the cemetery to remain a reserve under Corporation control and allows the Corporation control of the banks of the Burra Creek for planting etc. on the understanding that at any time they could resume the same or any part thereof if the Association finds it in its best interest.</p>
<p>The Council will write to SAMA thanking them for this offer, but explaining that they could not expend the rates on the basis of such uncertain tenure.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Crown Lands has informed Council that the Reserves in Redruth would be placed under Council control.</p>
<p>Letter to Editor.</p>
<p>Cr Ridgway writes re the recent elections, accusing last week&rsquo;s writer of being both libellous and impertinent. While sympathising with the South Ward for their predicament he denies it is any of his doing. Mr Geake&rsquo;s failure to be returned had nothing to do with him. He did not go into Mr Geake&rsquo;s shop to borrow the book containing the laws of the Corporation and did not know that Mr Geake had withdrawn until after the closing of nominations. He would be quite happy to see him on the Council. He regrets that the ratepayers were left without a choice in the matter. On the 20&rsquo; November he performed the duties imposed on him to the best of his abilities without fear or favour.</p>

<p>Editorial on the approaches to the main roads and the refusal of the Midland Road Board to pay their half of them. When the work was done it was on the assurance from the Board that they would pay half the cost and consequently a bill for between £40 &amp;£50 was sent to them for payment. Their surveyor then declared that although well made, the approaches were not required and were made to private entrances. This was not the case. After their recent visit the Board has decided they will pay half the cost on five of the least costly approaches. The Council will receive a sum of £16 or £17 instead of the £48 claimed. The Board&rsquo;s argument is that their duty is to provide for through and not for local traffic. If this is the case (though it seems rather useless to provide main roads one cannot get on or off) then this should have been made clear when the promise was given. If conditions of numbers or types of approaches is to be imposed and was omitted from their reply then the Council should not have to suffer for their mistakes. Captain Killicoat chose not to try to influence the result in favour of his own locality - in marked contrast to members who argued for the footbridge at Allen&rsquo;s Creek.</p>

<p>Midland Road Board 16 December.</p>
<p>The verdict on the Burra road approaches, as discussed in the editorial, is reported in a little more detail.</p>
<p>Redruth Bridge Opening.</p>
<p>For some months the Redruth Bridge has been very unsafe. Two or three years ago we believe a horse fell through a hole in the middle of the roadway and the laminated timber arches were known to be rotten to the core. The Midland Road Board decided to replace it with an iron bridge on account of the traffic it had to carry to and from the eastern country. The contract for the ironwork went to Messrs James Martin &amp; Co. of Gawler, but a long strike delayed completion and their girders were eventually put together in the yard of Mr Hooker of Adelaide. On the journey to the site one girder fell and it was feared it would have to be written off, but with effort the engineer, Mr Duff, managed to have it restored. Mr Duncan Grant got the job of assembling the new structure as well as removing the old bridge.</p>
<p>The Midland Road Board inspected the Eastern Plains, Robertstown, Government Wells, and the Baldina Creek Road before arriving at the bridge on Friday for the opening at 4.00 p.m. Captain Killicoat made a speech and broke a bottle of wine over it: naming it the Redruth Bridge, and declaring it open.</p>
<p>The Mayor and official party then drove across it before returning to Kooringa for a banquet given by the Mayor at 6.00 p.m. in the new hotel. The usual toasts were proposed in champagne and about 60 places were set.</p>
<p>The toasts are reported in 1 column of detail on page 3.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mr Brown of Mananarie [Mannanarie] was thrown from his cart on his way home from Yongala on Saturday and killed.</p>
<p>[Thomas Brown died 21 December 1879 Beniah Creek near Yongala aged 53.]</p>
<p>Crops. The harvest is proceeding rapidly and results are exceeding estimates. Many will get over 16 bushels per acre and some over 20. Very few will get less than 8-10.</p>
<p>Burra Town Council has resolved to ask the government for £500 to assist in cutting down the bank near the Institute and widening and raising the road into Kooringa to make access to the town easier and suitable for more traffic.</p>
<p>Steps are to be taken to secure a recreation ground for the town. Mr Ullmann has offered gum trees to be planted when the site has been obtained.</p>
<p>22 December</p>
<p>The Mayor said his idea was they should request a special grant to cut down the bank and raise the road from the new church to the Commercial St Bridge.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Ayers had been asked about a recreation ground site and he asked that they put the request in writing.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Public works has notified the Council that a gong would be placed at the Aberdeen railway crossing.</p>
<p>The police payment issue was discussed, but not resolved.</p>
<p>Flower Show. Burra&rsquo;s first flower show was a success and produced a cash balance of £15 towards next year&rsquo;s show. Next year it is intended to hold it much earlier. The show is reported in a 1 column article which includes the prize list. It was a great success. Most enthusiastic of the exhibitors were Mr [H.C.W.] Fuss, Mr Oppermann and Mr Loutit. The setting out of displays and other arrangement details could be improved upon with experience, but nevertheless it was very impressive for a first attempt. Results are rather hard to untangle but the following are an approximate list for Mr Fuss.</p>

<p>Gossip. The editor seeks to explain that Cousin Jenny &amp; Aunt Betty are a joke, in the face of complaints this week from the company boring the Market Square well. It is really an appeal for people to display a sense of humour.</p>
<p>Cousin Jenny &amp; Aunty Betty pursue a similar point in an article that runs for most of a column.</p>
<p>Harvesting Machines. The contest of machines continued at Gawler on 23 December: this time with four machines. The numbers of observers was reduced from thousands to several hundreds. The general opinion so far is that no machine is worth the prize offered, though some have the potential for development. Since a proportion of the prize money can be awarded, someone may yet be rewarded for their attempts.</p>
<p>Cricket. There will be a match played tomorrow on the ground near the German Church. The conclusion of the Burra v. True Blues saw a victory to the boys. True Blues 100 &amp; 103 (203) defeated</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor from Arthur Motley condemning the practice of burning stubble.</p>
<p>In another letter P.B. Moroney writes in praise of the Burra Hospital after being there some time. He especially thanks Dr Nesbitt and Matron Mrs Cox.</p>
<p>W. West writes as a member of the Flower Show Committee thanking all who made it such a success.</p>
<p>`Business&rsquo; complains of the poor delivery of letters to Kooringa. Last night, he says, the mail cart from the station did not arrive at the post office till after 10.00 p.m. He met a man in the street who had collected his letters from the Aberdeen post office and walked to Kooringa before the cart had arrived with the Kooringa mail!</p>
