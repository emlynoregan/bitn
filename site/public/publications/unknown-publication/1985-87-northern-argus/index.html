<p>Fire at Jennison’s in Burra</p>
<p>On Sunday morning fire caused extensive damage to Jennison’s Tyre Services. The alarm was raised by a passer-by at 5.52 a.m. The local MFS and six CFS volunteers attended. They were able to contain the fire in the eastern section of the building and bring it under control in an hour. The office area was water and smoke damaged, but the tyre area was saved. Unofficial estimates of damage are put at several hundred thousand dollars. [Two photographs of the aftermath.]</p>

<p>Copper Interpretation Centre</p>
<p>Rumours say that the Copper Interpretation Centre, which was the major component of the Jubilee 150 Burra heritage Town Project, is dead. The project was announced by the Premier in May 1983 as one of three major Jubilee 150 projects – the others being the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum and the restoration of Fort Glanville. All were to be funded by a $2 million grant from the Commonwealth Government and Burra’s share was to be $470,000.</p>
<p>From the start controversy has dogged Burra’s plans to have a Copper Interpretation centre – a concept of Ian Auhl and adopted by the Burra Burra DC. The Heritage Conservation Branch requested the Department of Environment and Planning to conduct a feasibility study and that favoured spending the major part of the allocation on a selection of heritage projects instead of just on the Copper Interpretation Centre. The Burra Burra DC voted unanimously to go on with the original concept.</p>
<p>The steering Committee was chaired by Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch, who became the working party chairman. There were representatives from the Heritage Conservation Unit., the History Trust of SA, the Department of Tourism, the Department of Mines and Energy, the Burra Burra DC and Burra National Trust.</p>
<p>The Burra Burra DC had some years earlier purchased the Salvation Army Citadel with the idea of its being developed as the Copper Interpretation Centre. An officer from the Heritage Conservation Branch deemed this to be unsuitable because of its ‘social atmosphere’ and geographic location. Other sites then considered were:</p>
<p>A new building at the Bon Accord Mine site.</p>
<p>A new building adjacent to Peacock’s Chimney.</p>
<p>A new building on the plateau on the eastern side of the Mine Pool.</p>
<p>A new building where Morphett’s Pumphouse boiler house stood.</p>
<p>Designs were drawn up and the first completed were costed at about twice the available funds. Amended designs cut the building virtually in half, gave minimal space to administration, but retained an adequate gallery area and the plateau site was chosen. The working party approved this and Barry Rowney of the Heritage Conservation Branch indicated verbally that the Branch would recommend approval.</p>
<p>Tenders were called and the lowest received was about 100% over the estimated cost. The working party immediately moved to vary the proposal slightly and move it to the boiler house site with a building the same size and similar silhouette to the former boiler house. Two architects have indicated their interest and belief that this building could be achieved within budget and could be completed by the target date of October 1986.</p>
<p>Rumours of the scuttling of the whole project and for the reallocation of the funds elsewhere have been circulating for two weeks. The Burra Burra DC has sought urgent answers from the Premier. The Department of Mines and Energy has been so supportive of the idea that it has already contributed $25,000 to be concentrated on Morphett’s Pumphouse and surrounds. Burra’s Tourist Officer Jenny O’Connor has joined the Council in lobbying fiercely for the project and to counter the claim that Burra has been slow to react - though no meetings were held between January 1984 and November 1984 and then only at the insistence of the Burra Burra Dc Chairman James Hawker. The allegation that there is now insufficient time to complete the project is denied by the architects. Of concern id the allegation that the Heritage Conservation Branch, which has been closely associated with the project, will not now approve building on the boiler house site. It has been alleged that the head of the Heritage Conservation Branch, Jon Womersley, when asked if his Department had any alternatives to offer, said, ‘No’.</p>

<p>Ian Auhl writes a letter to the editor commenting on the Copper Interpretation Centre Crisis.</p>
<p>If Burra loses the Jubilee 150 grant it threatens the viability of the town itself as a tourist town. The Copper Interpretation Centre was intended to interpret SA’s copper mining and place SA’s copper mining towns in a world perspective. Burra was recognised as the appropriate place for this by the Board of Jubilee 150 and as a result of a concept by R.J. Noye of Clare and lobbying by myself and the Burra Burra DC a grant of $270,000 was made to establish the Copper Interpretation Centre. The Centre would give SA a genuine historic town to show visitors - SA’s counterpart at Maldon in Victoria – and not to Swan Hill or Sovereign Hill. Burra is the genuine article. ‘Surely Burra will protest en masse to having its money, honestly obtained, dishonestly sidetracked to some other project.’</p>
<p>Perhaps the time has come got the town to strike against the delaying tactics of a government department ‘which seems to have decided from the very beginning of negotiations that it knows what it best for Burra’.</p>
<p>I have protested personally to the Premier and to the State Ombudsman with no tangible results. Other concerned people in Clare, Burra and Adelaide have also protested.</p>
<p>‘The net result of such protests is not a genuine attempt to find a satisfactory home for the Copper Centre, but to cease negotiations with Burra Council and to re-allocate the grant altogether.’</p>

<p>Burra Copper Interpretation Centre</p>
<p>Premier John Bannon has called for a report on the Copper Interpretation Centre from the Minister of Environment and Planning. The Copper Interpretation Centre is the major component of the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 project. The Council has repeated a request for an urgent meeting between the Burra Heritage Town Project and the executive committee of the Jubilee 150 Board to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Council is seeking to present and demonstrate a viable alternative within the project and to enable members of the Board and the working party to meet for discussions. It considers it unfortunate and unwarranted for the Jubilee 150 Board to consider the reallocation of a portion of the monies already granted to Burra for the Heritage Town Project.

<p>Dalgety Bennett Farmers’ new premises were opened recently by well-known merino identity Ron Pearse, former manager of the now closed Koonoona Merino Stud. A crowd of more than 200 attended the new air-conditioned building next to the Burra Hotel. A feature of the building is its façade in bluestone taken from the old Farmers’ Union building that was on the same site. It and the bullnosed verandah are both in keeping with Burra’s heritage. Branch manager Andrew Butler said the new premises would be an asset to the rural community in Burra and district. It would offer a bigger and better showroom and improved product display. John Secomb, the Dalgety Bennetts Farmers’ northern regional manager, said that when he started in Burra with Oates Ltd in 1960 there were five stock agents in town. Today there were two. Noel O’Brien, the firm’s general manager, also spoke at the opening.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor from Helen Stockman</p>
<p>I must add my voice to those already raised regarding the reallocation of $210,000 set aside for the Copper Interpretation Centre. It seems the Jubilee 150 Board held that:</p>
<p>Burra was slow to react to the crisis</p>
<p>There was not now time to complete the project.</p>
<p>It was only at the stage that tenders were received that the working party became aware of the architect’s gross miscalculations and an approach was then immediately made to the Jubilee 150 Board to vary the proposal slightly – for a smaller building on the boilerhouse site rather than the larger one on the plateau.</p>
<p>The working party immediately consulted two architects who believe that the project as revised can be completed within budget and in the time available. The official opening was always scheduled for October 1986. The reallocation of the money has been done without conferring with Burra and in unseemly haste.</p>
<p>When you employ an architect recommended by the Heritage Branch itself you expect the job is being done properly and it is quite unfair for Burra to be punished for that man’s mistake. Objections to the proposed site by the Heritage Conservation Unit should be investigated thoroughly. To be totally purist about the ruins there is to let them decay until they finally collapse and that is not acceptable to me or to many others in Burra. Enthusiastic support has been given by the Department of Mines and Energy. Burra is not accustomed to making a botch of heritage based projects.</p>

<p>Burra Show. After early drizzle the sun shone brightly for Burra’s 108th Show.</p>
<p>[This was not the 108th Burra Show. The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year. The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time. The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought. (The event returned in 1915.) Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II. The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]</p>
<p>The Society’s President Jock Duncan was well pleased with the attendance. John Olsen Leader of the Opposition officially opened the show. This year some asphalt around the pavilions improved the area for visitors. Cheree Deverson was Miss Mini Show Girl.

<p>Market Square</p>
<p>A petition with 570 signatures has called for a halt to any further installation of electricity poles in Market Square and for postponement of redevelopment work until an artist’s impression has been published in the press and a public meeting held to discuss proposals.</p>
<p>The petition was organised by Burra National Trust and presented to Council by its President Mrs Maureen Wright. For some years the Council has had plans to underground the electricity, improve traffic flow and redesign parking. Although plans have been publicised they did not clearly show the position and design of the new lightin poles. The type of light pole has created concern. The standard goose-neck poles were deemed unsuitable for a heritage town and their position on proposed protuberances has also roused concern. In presenting the petition Mrs Wright spoke about Burra as a Heritage Town and urged the Council to reconsider the pole choice. Mr John Modra of the Highways Department spoke outlining the accepted standards and stressed that the safety factor. The funding arrangements were also outlined. Council accepted the petition and will discuss the situation at its executive meeting early this week. Meanwhile undergrounding of power lines is proceeding as there was general consensus that this was desirable. Other work has been halted.</p>
<p>Plans were also produced at the meeting for the proposed Burra North deviation or Ludgvan Street Bypass. The Highways Department hopes to proceed with that project in the next financial year. [1986-87]</p>

<p>Barrow Push Teams are assembling in Broken Hill. In Burra in anticipation of the finish Market Square will be closed to traffic from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. Live bands will play in the rotunda. Food and drink stalls will operate and Radio 5PI will have its van there. Other stalls will be set up. The SES is providing a service all along the route and medical back-up has been arranged. From 4 p.m. celebrations will move to the creek area where there will also be stalls and a disco has been arranged in the Town Hall at 8 p.m. by the Burra Rural Youth Club.</p>
<p>A Burra Picnic Race Meeting &amp; Gymkhana is being arranged for Sunday 6 April at Thistlebeds Station 10 miles east of Burra on property owned by the Kellock family. There will be a woolshed dance on 5 April. Proceeds will aid the RFDS and the Hostel for the Aged in Burra.</p>
<p>The Courthouse Hotel is being renovated. A major part of the renovation is the restoration of stone walling on the western side, replacing the steel sliding doors, dating from the building’s use as a garage. The Burra Uniting Church is making the old hotel into a self-sufficient camp site to cater for c. 30 people. It will be able to accommodate small groups or could be used in conjunction with Redruth Camping Centre, which caters for c. 50. All the work is being done in keeping with the style of the 1858 building.</p>
<p>Burra Burra DC has received correspondence notifying it that the plan for Market Square redevelopment had not been forwarded to the Australian Heritage Commission for approval, as was required. The whole of the town is on the Register of the National Estate and therefore the project must not proceed without the approval of the State heritage Branch. After a recent meeting a small working party from the Council, the Highways Department, the Road Traffic Board, the National Trust and the State Heritage Branch will meet to look at the proposal.</p>

<p>The Ian Auhl Collection</p>
<p>The Burra Burra DC has recently acquired the Ian Auhl Burra History Collection. The collection, which will be kept in the custody of the Burra Community Library, consists of an indexed collection of newspaper references to the Burra Burra Mine and its townships covering the period from the discovery of copper in 1845 to the closure of the Burra Burra Mine in 1877.</p>
<p>It also includes a biographical index of names of people mentioned in the references, a collection of maps relating to Burra and district, a collection of photographs and negatives relating to Burra and district, a library of books relating to Burra and an extensive collection of miscellaneous references to the Mine and its townships and various other indexes.</p>
<p>The collection was begun in 1965 when Ian Auhl was principal of Burra Primary School. It finished in 1985 with the submission to the publishers of the author’s book The Story of the Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-77. It began with items researched from copies of the SA Register dating from 1852 and held by the Burra Institute Library. When Mr Auhl was transferred to Adelaide in 1969 arrangements were made for the State Library to photocopy each newspaper item. Subsequently each item researched and submitted was photocopied and all newspaper items were microfilmed and negatives made of all photographs. The collection was begun when the author was preparing tourist pamphlets and realised that Burra had no local paper till 1876. No books on the history of the mine and its townships existed apart from some centenary publications.</p>
<p>The intended use of the material was to prepare tourist pamphlets and then a short history of the mine and its townships. This resulted in the publication in 1969 of the Burra Sketchbook with drawings by Maurice Perry, which has been reprinted five times. It was subsequently used in the compilation of the Burra Conservation Study in 1978 and in various Burra histories and to make submissions to the District Council and in making submissions for heritage listing for Burra Buildings and of course for Ian Auhl’s major history as mentioned, to be published in 1986. It has supplied authors, organisations, families and individuals with information on the history of Burra and its people. Mr Auhl has said that he considers the Conservation Study of 1978 to be the most valuable result of the collection.</p>
<p>Originally the collection was to be housed in the Copper Museum and Interpretation Centre. The author’s ill health and doubts about the funding for that centre have made it necessary for the author to agree to the housing of the collection in the Burra Community Library, in the care of the Library Board of Management in accordance with an agreed management policy drawn up by the Librarian Colin Fidock. A complete copy of all but the photographic material has been made by the librarian of the Mortlock Library. Both the Burra Community Library and the State Library are processing the material to make it available for public access in 1986. The author and librarians envisage the collection as growing in the future as there is still the period after the closure of the mine in 1877 to be researched and written about.</p>
<p>The microfilm of the Burra Record for 1876 to 1977 is available. Challenges to Burra’s role as a historic town can only be met by substantiated facts, properly documented. Mr Auhl considers that the future security and growth of the collection is assured and has expressed his gratitude to Colin Fidock and the staff and to Roger Henderson, Principal of Burra Community School for their co-operation and understanding.</p>
<p>Mr Auhl has expressed a hope that the collection ‘will attract the commitment to its further use and growth in the course of the future of Burra and district.’</p>

<p>St Mary’s, Burra is undergoing repairs with the aid of a $25,000 heritage grant.</p>
<p>It has been having problems with the letting in of water on the weather wall and into the organ loft. A National Trust architect estimated the repairs at about $30,000 three years ago. The Heritage Commission grant came in response to an application by the Rector Fr Richard Morris. As well as the grant they offered a loan for the rest of the cost. Fr Morris believes the trouble stems from the replacement of lime mortar with cement about twenty-five years ago. Clare builders McKendrick &amp; Ahern began work about a month ago and expect to finish at the end of March. They will re-point and repair the weather wall at the top where the pointing was bad. They will replace the guttering and attend to flashings, ridge capping and parapet walls, waterproofing the last. The windows will be sealed and the interior re-plastered in preparation for painting. The 81-year-old pipe organ cost $700 in 1905 and was overhauled four years ago for $4,000. Its replacement today would cost about $70,000.</p>
<p>Recent renovations have allowed the removal of a window from the original St Mary’s from its storage in the organ loft. It will now be repaired and placed in a more visible position in the church. It was originally placed in old St Mary’s in 1872.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC, February meeting</p>
<p>Council approved in principle the formation of a Burra Heritage Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The committee is envisaged as being made up of top class professionals as well as community and Council representatives and would, it is believed, become a valuable consultative body.</p>
<p>Its brief could include preparation of a long term management plan for Burra as well as comment and assistance on projects like the Market Square redevelopment.</p>

<p>Tourist Officers from various regions met at Burra last Tuesday 11 February for the Inland Tourism Seminar. Cr Des Woolley as Chairman of the Burra Tourist Association chaired the meeting, which was held to discuss their proposed Inland Australia Ring Route. The ring is roughly Broken Hill to Peterborough to Burra, then Morgan, Renmark, Mildura, Wentworth and Broken Hill. There are opportunities to strike out from places en route to the Flinders Ranges or the Clare Valley. Burra Burra DC Chairman Mr James Hawker was the guest speaker, resplendent in his 1830s attire.</p>
<p>He said Burra’s chief tourist resources were its fine examples of mid Victorian buildings and its copper mining heritage. He outlined the Council’s actions:</p>
<p>The purchase of a building for use as a tourist office</p>
<p>Appointment of a Tourist Officer</p>
<p>Purchase of other heritage items</p>
<p>Has sought publicity through supporting activities like the Barrow Push</p>
<p>Tourism meant employment. In 1982 14,000 visited the Burra Tourist Office and in 1985 there were 30,000 visitors. Jenny O’Connor Burra’s Tourist Officer also addressed the meeting, during which she paid tribute to the work of historian Ian Auhl.</p>

<p>Ian Auhl’s new book, The Story of the Monster Mine is to be launched by the Director of the Department of Mines and Energy Mr R. Keith Johns at the Mines Department Building on 25 March. Mr Johns’ great great grandfather was Thomas Roberts, the first Captain of the Burra Burra Mine.</p>
<p>Ian Auhl was born in Burra in 1914 into a family which had lived in the district since pioneering days. He returned in 1964 as headmaster of Burra Primary School. Following his retirement he has written prolifically on Burra and this large book of 488 pages, 15 colour plates, 50 illustrations, plus maps and numerous photographs is the culmination of years of valuable research.</p>
<p>Pam Marlow has carried out the initial work on the Jubilee Project to build a scale model of the Burra Mine to be housed in the Bon Accord Mining Museum. The module of Morphett’s Enginehouse, boiler house and capstan has been on display in Bence’s window. This is one of 33 groups of buildings which will slot into the landscape model, which is about 5 metres by 6.5 metres in area. It will provide a picture of how the mine looked in about 1860. The landscape is planned for completion in May and the glazing of the display is due to be done in September, ahead of the museum’s opening in October. Pam and Phil Marlow and children have recently moved to Pinaroo, so on site work will be limited to school holidays. Pam will continue to work on the models at her new home. Many others have contributed to the huge task, especially Brian Salter and Peter Stitt.</p>
<p>Burra Burra DC has recently purchased a second-hand Toyota Landcruiser personnel carrier to seat up to 8 for the Burra SES. It is currently undergoing necessary fitting out.</p>
<p>The Caring &amp; Sharing Group is meeting again this year and Dr R. Oswald was guest speaker at their last meeting when he spoke on high blood pressure. On 4 March he will conduct a workshop on drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Market Square. The meeting mentioned in CXV, 8037, 22 January 1986, page 18 to discuss proposals was convened on 21 February. The Council produced the plan for the Square that they had approved. After discussion they agreed to retain the existing curved kerb line, to remove the proposed protuberance from the north side of Commercial Street adjacent to the ANZ Bank and on the south side to change the protuberances to slightly raised areas. On the basis of these changes indication was given that the Heritage Branch would now give written approval. Council will also look into the question of lighting.</p>
<p>Sealing the Burra-Hanson Section of the Barrier Highway is proceeding steadily.</p>
<p>CXVI, 8043, 5 March 1986, page 6</p>
<p>D. Rayfield &amp; G.R. O’Connor wrote separate letters challenging the previous report of the meeting relating to Market Square. In lengthy arguments their allegations are in essence:</p>
<p>There was disagreement about who should be allowed to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The meeting was less amicable than portrayed in the article.</p>
<p>The agreed plan does not represent much of a change from the Council’s original position.</p>
<p>Agreement with it represents considerable backing down by those initially opposed to the proposal.</p>
<p>The essential change they object to is the loss of the curved roadway (despite the retention of its kerb line) thus destroying the 140-year-old character of Market Square.</p>
<p>Theft. A car was stolen from outside its owner’s address in Kingston Street and later found completely wrecked on the Barrier Highway north of Manoora.</p>
<p>Theft. A number of children aged 5-10 have been cautioned for stealing items from cars in Market Square and Queen Street.</p>
<p>Other Crimes. A series of local crimes are troubling Police. A hotel has been broken into and about $3,300 stolen. Items to the value of about $3,100 have been stolen from a maintenance depot.</p>
<p>A shop at Burra North was broken into and cigarettes, food stuffs and drinks worth $600 were stolen.</p>
<p>The Sunday Mail (Adelaide) 2 March 1986 Magazine Section, page 43</p>
<p>There is a full page article on the opposition in Burra to the re-development of Market Square.</p>
<p>The article says citizens are taking on the Council, the Highways Department and the State Heritage Branch to save the roadway round the curve of Market Square.</p>
<p>Council wishes to close this roadway in the interests of better traffic flow and safety. Protesters say this is a nonsense and the last serious accident was more than 35 years ago and Council is merely indulging in a whim. The Burra Preservation Organisation has been formed to defend the Square and has nearly 300 members. They claim that Market Square is the heart of Burra historically and economically. It is said to be the first spot laid out by the South Australian Mining Association, the place where settlers gathered to pay a shilling a bucket for water and where people have always gathered for celebrations and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The row erupted first in December when goose-neck street lights appeared and residents wanted lights more in keeping with the character of the 140-year-old architecture. About 140 ratepayers attended a meeting and all but one of the lights have been removed. Protesters say they have not been informed of the plans for the Square and are angry. BPO Chairman Gerry O’Connor believes the Square is the town’s most impressive asset. Leonard Bence said ‘We don’t want a model paved square where people can park’.</p>
<p>[Other objectors cited were Richard Dollman (22), Derek Rayfield and Jenny O’Connor.]</p>
<p>Jenny O’Connor said tourism had doubled in the last two years.</p>
<p>John McBride and Angas McInnes also objected. National Trust Chairwoman Mrs Maureen Wright said the National Trust would have preferred to have retained the road, but the Trust does not violently oppose the compromise plan. Out of it all comes the realisation that the Market Square precinct is not on the State heritage List.</p>

<p>CXVI, 8044, 12 March 1986, page 18</p>
<p>Burra National Trust AGM was held in Burra Civic Centre last Tuesday 4 March.</p>
<p>President Maureen Wright said they were one of 57 branches in SA (the only state with a branch system). In Burra the Trust owned six properties and was responsible for three others. (Leasing the Paxton Square Cottage No. 11 and caring for the jinker and Powder Magazine.) This was a large job and the income came from key hire, bus tours and fund-raising. Most of 1985’s objectives had been realised. The J150 $30,000 allocated to the Bon Accord had been spent. An application has been made for a $21,000 CEP grant to work on the Bon Accord surrounds and re-fence and define the car park. $5000 was being spent on a case to house Pam Marlow’s mine model and a History Trust grant of $8,500 will be spent on display and interpretation. Lock-up restoration work is almost complete under the care of architect David Gilbert, using a National Estate grant of $12,000.</p>
<p>A small committee has worked to prepare scripts for signs for the sites and liaison with the Department of Mines, Department of Tourism and the Burra Burra DC will allow special enamelled signs at Trust sites at the same time as signs are done for the J150 project at the mine.</p>
<p>Volunteers will photograph all buildings in Burra on the same day within the next two months.</p>
<p>A dramatic event is planned for Redruth Gaol in association with the Arts Council and Flinders University drama students.</p>
<p>In 1985 the Trust became involved with several issues including the redevelopment of Market Square. I am disturbed that Council seems reluctant to consult with us over issues of major importance. The Council’s recent decision to form a Burra Heritage Advisory Committee is a good one.</p>
<p>[Mrs Wright then went on to thank all those who had helped the Trust throughout the year.]</p>

<p>R.M. Gebhardt of Mt Bryan writes re electors’ meetings. He writes a one-column attack on them as a waste of time and a farce. Councillors are willing to accept praise for minor works done, but will not seriously discus the levels of rates, which are high. He says there is no way they can afford to spend $650,000 on the Market Square project. Also the administrative costs are excessive at 52% of income, when Hallett DC has only 26%.</p>
<p>E.T. Baulderstone writes on Paxton Square costs.</p>
<p>He writes as Treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management.</p>
<p>The following is an outline of the management, finance, etc. of the Paxton Square Cottages Project.</p>
<p>Most people are aware that the cottages contribute to the history of SA and Australia.</p>
<p>I have been connected with their management for the past 20 years and wish to bring the correct facts to the notice of the grumblers who insist their rates are spent financing these cottages.</p>
<p>About four years ago the cottages were transferred to the Burra Burra DC gratis, the main reason being that the Council was in a position to receive grants, etc. for their development.</p>
<p>During the last three years approximately $500,000 has been made available in grants etc.</p>
<p>The Council appointed a management board to manage these grants and arranged for a loan of $100,000 for the first stage, which opened in April 1983 as holiday cottages.</p>
<p>18 months later the second stage was opened.</p>
<p>Since being in operation, the board has paid all loan repayments, amounting to over $65,000 and capital expenditure $42,000, in addition to the maintenance and operating costs.</p>
<p>We are now in a position to contribute $40,000 towards the third stage with a cost of $120,000.</p>
<p>The Council has arranged for a loan of $80,000 for the balance, which will be repaid from our profits and will cost the ratepayers nothing, while making the property more valuable.</p>
<p>A complete financial statement is rendered at each monthly meeting of the board and a copy is forwarded to Council.</p>
<p>A yearly statement is presented at the annual public meeting attended by very few ratepayers.</p>
<p>‘Stop grumbling and uttering false statements among the people of our community. I am available at most times to answer queries in a sensible manner.’</p>

<p>The Redruth Guild Diamond Jubilee luncheon was attended by about 100 people. It was a luncheon and musical afternoon and as it was to be the Guild’s final gathering before closure, it was attended by many former ministers and their wives. Redruth Wesleyan Church was established in 1851, but later demolished. A second church was built in 1857 and the present building was erected in 1874. When Burra became a town with just one Methodist Church, the services were held at the Kooringa Church, but the Guild continued for many years, finding fellowship and raising funds for the church. The final act of the Guild will be to donate its funds to the renovation of the Redruth Church so it can be used as a worship centre for the Redruth Camping Centre or for a museum. Reta Jennison was the Guild Secretary for some 52 years and then became President up to its final meeting. The Guild has been operating for 61 years.</p>

<p>McBride Cottages in Chapel Street have been given by the McBride Cottage Trust (along with money accrued from rents) to the Burra Burra DC. The Council and the SA Housing Trust will now re-develop the row to become one-bedroom units with new kitchens, bathrooms and laundries. With the money accrued the Council has purchased a block of land [diagonally] opposite the Kooringa Hotel and the SA Housing Trust intends to construct a group of aged person’s cottages there and on the block alongside the old Salvation Army Citadel. Plans are being drawn up to blend in with the type of architecture in the area. The balance of the funds in the McBride Trust will be used to landscape the vicinity of the Chapel Street row.</p>

<p>Market Square</p>
<p>About 45 members of the Burra Preservation Organisation blocked Market Square with cars and trucks at 6 a.m. last Thursday to stop Council workers from proceeding with the re-development. By mid-morning about 20 remained and when a bulldozer moved in several protestors stepped onto its blade, halting work for the day. On Friday Council workers began at 6 a.m. and removed grass in the square’s centre while police restrained a small group of protestors. Secretary of BPO Derek Rayfield said the BPO had been prepared to sit down and compromise last Thursday, but all requests had been ignored. Eunice Baker, a member of BPO, said although she felt uncomfortable participating in the blockade, she saw it as a last ditch attempt to preserve the square.</p>
<p>BPO believes the proposed changes with road widening and new car parking spaces would destroy the historical character of the square and restrict the free flow of traffic. Burra District Clerk Rod Walsh said the changes were needed to improve traffic management.</p>
<p>A petition prepared by BPO was signed by more than 800 people. Council Chairman James Hawker said people had been misled about the changes and intimidated into signing the petition. A blatantly inaccurate map of the changes had accompanied the petition.</p>
<p>Derek Rayfield in a letter to the Argus blamed the Council itself for the story regarding the removal of the Rotunda and the rose garden. He denied any improper actions in collecting the 819 signatures. Council has said in a circular that the lack of formalised parking arrangements results in illegal parking and hazardous traffic manoeuvres and Council fears for its legal position in the event of accidents.</p>
<p>Last November 570 people signed a petition calling a halt to the installation of new electricity [i.e. light] poles in Market Square. They deemed the standard goose-necked poles unsuitable for a heritage town and as a result those installed were removed. Council now proposes to install round-type ETSA post-top lights and there will be no goose-neck poles.</p>
<p>In January the re-development was halted when the Community Employment Program notified Council that an oversight had been made in not getting the changes approved by the Australian Heritage Commission. A meeting in Adelaide on 21 February resulted in the State Heritage Branch indicating its assent for the scheme to continue. The estimated cost for the project is $109,000 of which $50,000 comes from a J150 Local Government Road Assets Program loan with a subsidised interest rate of 9% for 12 years and a grant of $54,000 from the Community Employment Program. Council’s contribution is $5,800.</p>
<p>CXVI, 8048, 9 April 1986, page 4</p>
<p>Jenny O’Connor writes a short obituary for Market Square.</p>
<p>D. Rayfield for the Burra Preservation Organisation writes a letter of some 13⁄4 columns.</p>
<p>He protests about a letter in the Argus of 2 April from L. Evans. He says that L. Evans, as far as he can determine, is a figment of someone’s imagination. The story of the Rotunda and rose garden being moved did not originate from the BPO, but from ‘our illustrious White House’. A public meeting last December gave Council a vote of no confidence on the lights and the re-development and called for a poll on the issue. This was ignored.</p>
<p>At a meeting in Burra in late January Mr B. Rowney of State Heritage, Adelaide, said that the radiused roadway in front of the Tourist Office should stay as it was and not be tampered with. Mr Don Hele of National Trust, Adelaide, expressed the same view. At the meeting on 21 February in Adelaide the State heritage Director Mr Jon Womersley ruled that the radiused road would be closed and modified protuberances be constructed, State Heritage over-riding objections to this.</p>
<p>[He then goes on at length to justify the validity of the petition and to express his disappointment on behalf of the BPO at the actions of Councillors’ in the whole saga.]</p>
<p>Georgina Hyde writes a 1⁄2-column letter protesting the poor state of Burra’s footpaths. It is no wonder that very often visitors and locals alike are seen walking on the roads.</p>

<p>D. Rayfield writes to the editor that in Burra there are signs of improved roads and footpaths under a Bi-centennial CEP scheme, but recently Council, presumably for lack of funding has gone around taking up large quantities of existing footpath edging so it could be put down in Market Square. Residents have been told it was removed to widen footpaths, but work has not continued in these areas. ‘The people in the White House must think we are a gullible lot.’</p>

<p>Paxton Square</p>
<p>Phase three of the Paxton Square redevelopment is under way. The re-creation of the old manse is all but completed and the restoration of the Bible Christian Chapel is proceeding. The original manse was pulled down many years ago*, but with the restoration of both the Bridge Terrace and the Kingston Street Rows of cottages the Lewis Board of Management felt that the next step ought to be the reconstruction of the manse for use by the caretaker and his family, who currently live in two of the cottages in the Kingston Street row. Once the cottage is completed they will move in, freeing the two cottages for holiday rental. The Bible Christian Chapel next door is believed to be the oldest Bible Christian Chapel in Australia and restoration is being undertaken with great care. The original wooden roofing will be left exposed from the interior and it will be used as the booking office for the cottages and an interpretive centre for the square. A sum of $80,000 has been borrowed by the District Council to enable the development and this loan will be repaid by the Lewis Board of Management. Work has been authorised by the State heritage Conservation Branch.</p>

<p>The Burra Civic Jubilee Ball on Saturday was a great success. Roger Boehm, driving one of the National Trust’s buggies, delivered quite a few to the Town Hall. The Hall looked fine after its spit and polish. Cr James Hawker met the Governor and Lady Dunstan at the kerbside and accompanied them into the hall where Sir Donald Dunstan declared the ball officially open. Mr Hawker presented the Governor with a copy of Ian Auhl’s new book, The Story of the Monster Mine. During his speech the Governor said his great great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and the family had lived for a time in dugouts in the creek. Later, upon hearing that Florrie Scroop was Australia Day Award winner for the Jubilee Year, Lady Dunstan sent her the posy she had been given on arrival. A troupe of dancers from Danse Victoriana performed during the evening. A contingent of BCS students assisted on the night as did the Queen’s Scouts and their leader David Jennings.</p>

<p>Don Lloyd writes to the editor:</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to hear Mr Hawker refer to the recently revealed turned wood frontage to the gallery at the Town Hall. How fortunate that it was covered up and not removed. In the same week the unique signpost in Market Square was removed. Hoe many years had that been part of Burra? Over the years much heritage has been removed. In recent years the main school building and the Town Hall steps have been under threat and the maternity wing of the hospital has been demolished. What will be threatened next? Will the wall in front of Polly’s Tea Rooms be plastered or the wooden steps from the road destroyed. The proposed Ludgvan Street deviation will see more destroyed and the railway overpass will probably be bulldozed so it can be enlarged. The expensive mess that is now Market Square will not prevent accidents. The signpost should be returned and restored to its original state with wooden posts and chains.</p>

<p>[This was not the 109th Burra Show. The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year. The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time. The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought. (The event returned in 1915.) Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II. The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]</p>

<p>D. Rayfield writes to the editor re the Burra rates.</p>
<p>The rates have not risen by 7.64% - in fact the average house owner in Burra has had a rate rise of 15% and in other towns of 14.28%. The increase for many commercial properties is far greater – 50% or more. This far exceeds the inflation rate, which is currently about 8.3%.</p>

<p>Pam Marlow’s Model of the Burra Mine in about 1860, housed in the Bon Accord Mine Museum, is now nearing completion after some four years of labour. About half the time was taken in research and development of techniques. The model is part of the Burra Burra DC’s Jubilee Project. The model is at a scale of 1:87, which allows for about half a square kilometre to be displayed. The model shows the mine in its peak of prosperity. The general landscape has been created from plaster over chicken wire to which individual module boards containing groups of building fit. This has been done because Pam has lived at Aldgate and Pinnaroo since 1983 and this permits her to work at home. The model will be open to the public view from 5 October.</p>

<p>Don Hele, Chairman of the Urban Conservation Committee of the National Trust, spoke last Friday night to a group of traders, Council and other members of the community about adopting the ‘Main Street Program’ for Burra.</p>
<p>The program was devised in the USA by Mary Means and it calls for total cooperation and foresight. It covers organisation, design, promotion and economic restructuring. Over 600 American towns have used the program to reverse trends of a dying main commercial street. Economic expertise was needed as well as the services of perhaps an architect or consultant on trading. The scheme would restore buildings externally to what they were. Owners of premises should wait till they could afford to restore buildings properly. Nothing looks sadder than unused buildings. Signage should be unobtrusive. Slides of examples of good restoration from Port Adelaide, Gawler, and Aldgate were shown. In Burra food availability needs improvement and things like aluminium tiles on old cottages spoil the character of the town.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital. The 109th annual report from the Chairman Harry Quinn voiced concerns about possible changes in Burra. Recent media reports highlighted proposals to remove maternity and acute care beds from smaller country hospitals in favour of additional nursing home type beds. The Board wished to voice their opposition to this. The changes would see a loss of services and therefore of trained staff and job opportunities and potentially health risks for trauma and other acute patients and expectant mothers.</p>

<p>Fire. Three cottages in the unrestored row of Paxton Square were gutted by fire on Sunday causing an estimated $50,000 damage. Police who investigated believe the fire was deliberately started by using a cigarette lighter or matches to ignite a mattress. Smoke was seen coming from under the cottage roofs at 3.30 p.m. on Sunday. It took hold in the wooden shingles covered in corrugated iron. The walls of the cottages were intact after the fire, which took two hours to extinguish. The decently restored Kingston street row will be officially opened on 5 October as part of the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project. [Two photos of the fire in Paxton Terrace.]</p>
<p>Burra Heritage Town J150 Project which received a grant of $270,000 opens on Sunday 5 October at the Burra Mine site. The Director General of the Department of Mines &amp; Energy, Mr Keith Jones, will open the three project sites: Morphett’s Enginehouse, Bon Accord Mine Museum and the Kingston Street row of the Paxton Square cottages. Speakers will include Kym Bonython, Chairman of the J150 Board. The three foot thick walls of Morphett’s Enginehouse now stand as strong as they did last century. A pumping accident nearly tore the place apart in the 1870s and a fire that gutted the Enginehouse and the shaft in the 1920s left it a ruin. A J150 allocation of $90,000 and the Department of Mines &amp; Energy grant of $35,000, plus contributions from the Burra Burra DC and the Department of Tourism have seen the building restored. It is now the world’s only restored Cornish Enginehouse. Burra Apex has been working to restore the adit tunnel to the shaft and they hope to have it ready for Sunday’s opening.

<p>Paxton Square</p>
<p>In the unrestored cottage (one of eleven) vandals had sat on the dirt floor and scrawled psychedelic-coloured words on the stone walls where whitewash peeled off in fragments. They had sat around a burnt out shell of a fireplace and passed through the corrugated iron lean-to added in the 1930s, when poor families in the Great Depression had sheltered extra babies and boiled their clothes in coppers.</p>
<p>The three rows of eleven cottages each were built by the SA Mining Association in 1849. Two thousand miners and their families had lived in dugouts in the creek banks, but floods had forced them out so Paxton Square was built. There were a few changes over the years. Verandahs were added in the 1930s and the rows of backyard toilets were later removed. In 1913 John Lewis, a former Burra resident, bought the square and presented it to the Burra Corporation to be used by ‘the indigent and deserving people who did not get drunk’.</p>
<p>[Actually the Corporation rejected the offer, fearing that the income generated would not cover maintenance and they would be left with a bill. Eventually a Trust was established to manage the cottages.]</p>
<p>Paxton Square was gazetted a Historic Reserve in 1969.</p>
<p>Twenty-two of the thirty-three cottages have now been restored and adapted to low cost holiday accommodation. They feature whitewashed walls, open fireplaces, Berber carpets, slate floors and pine furnishings. The renovations were possible following a $150,000 J150 grant, money from a Federal Government job creation scheme and funds from the Lewis Board of Management.</p>

<p>Bon Accord Mine Site</p>
<p>Many relics of the busy mining days at Burra have been placed in the restored Engineer’s Workshop (1858) of the Bon Accord Mine, adjacent to the Burra Mine site. Mining stopped at ‘The Bon’ when little copper was found and the miners went to the Victorian gold rush. When they returned another effort was made, but also failed. The mine’s main shaft was utilised as the town’s water source in the 1870s* when the Burra Mine closed. Water from ‘The Bon’ was piped into Burra until 1966 and afterwards the E &amp; WS Department gradually transferred the site to the National Trust. The restoration of the Bon Accord site was made possible through a J150 grant of $30,000, History Trust of SA grants totalling $11,783 and National Trust expenditure of about $6,000.</p>
<p>[This is not quite accurate. The real story is complex, but in outline, the reticulation of water from the Bon Accord in the 1870s was extremely limited. It extended to only a handful of homes and was mainly directed to water troughs for animals. It was not extended to Kooringa until 1884. The water did not at this time come from the main shaft, but from one straddling the border of the property on Linkson Street. The pumping operations were not transferred to the old main Bon Accord shaft until 1908.]</p>

<p>On Sunday 5 October between 300 and 400 people gathered at Morphett’s Enginehouse for the official opening of the Burra Heritage Town J150 project by the Director-General of the Department of Mines &amp; Energy, Mr Keith Johns. [Details given in the issue of 1 October are basically repeated about the nature of the project.]</p>
<p>Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr Jack McMahon gave a brief history of the project. He paid tribute to the work of Ian Auhl for his research and the documentation of Burra’s History. He thanked the various members of the working party and the contractors and architects and also Adelaide &amp; Wallaroo Fertilizers for help with site works and fencing and Burra Apexians for more than 800 hours of volunteer work. Kym Bonython spoke as Chairman of the J150 Board. Keith Johns said his great grandfather was Thomas Roberts, Burra’s first mine captain. Just as he was about to declare the project open, a severe rainstorm burst over Burra, scattering the assembled people, but later the weather improved and buses ran a shuttle service to allow people to visit the three sites of the project.</p>

<p>Ratepayers Wish to Secede</p>
<p>193 Burra Burra Dc ratepayers have proposed seceding from the District and joining Hallett DC. A hearing will be held in November. Hallett DC has proposed to the Local Government Advisory Commission that the Hundreds of Kingston, Mongolata, Rees and part of Ayers be annexed to Hallett.</p>
<p>Spokesman for the 193 ratepayers, Bob Gebhardt, said Burra roads and Council plant were run down because of lavish expenditure on unnecessary projects like the J150 project and tourist ventures. Also Burra rural rates were twice those of Hallett and there was no communication between the Council and ratepayers.</p>
<p>Burra Burra District Clerk, Rodney Walsh refused to comment. A meeting of Booborowie and Mt Bryan residents (who are in the affected area) set up a steering committee of twelve at a meeting on 26 June to plan the secession. Further ratepayer meetings were held at Mt Bryan on 15 September and at Hallett on 18 September. Chairman of the Hallett DC, John Hale, said that Council was in favour of the move. Hallett had only one permanent and one casual staff, while Burra had 6 administration staff. The change would add one to Hallett’s staff. They would like to see Burra return to a Corporation while Hallett took care of rural ratepayers.</p>

<p>Burra Lutherans gathered last Sunday at the site of the original Lutheran Church in Burra for the dedication of a memorial cairn opposite the Court House in Burra North. The cairn was erected by Roger Frahn and Owen Schulz and identifies the nearby ruins as the foundations of the original church built in 1851 to serve the needs of families who came from the Harz Mountains in Germany as smelters. Not long after being built it was nearly deserted when the men went to the Victorian goldfields. It was later rented to a lodge and was destroyed by fire after one of its meetings in July 1910.*</p>
<p>[There are several errors in this paragraph:</p>
<p>Construction was begun in 1851, but abandoned in 1852 when the walls were about four feet high.</p>
<p>When men returned from the goldfields it was completed and finally opened for service in September 1861.</p>
<p>It was used by many different groups over several decades. The Aberdeen Oddfellows’ Lodge seems to have met there for most of the building’s existence. The building is reported as burning down on the evening of Wednesday 20 July 1910. Since the lodge meetings were held on alternate Thursdays, this was not following a lodge meeting. Earlier in the night Mr C. Lowe had been in the premises cleaning the lamps, but no cause for the fire could be established.]</p>

<p>Representatives of the Burra Burra DC, the Hospital Board and Carmel O’Connor met with Neil Andrew MP on Friday to express their concern at Burra’s failure so far to attract funding for an Aged Persons’ Hostel. Carmel O’Connor has conducted a survey indicating an urgent need for such a hostel – the nearest is at Eudunda, and it is full. Currently about 25 people in Burra need such accommodation. Plans for a 25 bed facility were drawn up, then reduced to 20 and then to 15 to try to get funding, but to no avail. People must leave the district and some are occupying hospital beds because there is nowhere else to go. The hospital had allocated $100,000 towards the estimated $700,000 cost.</p>

He said the present plan was to retain the current number of staff at Burra – about 40. In the last three months about $1.4 million has been spent at Burra – about $1 million of that on rebuilding and upgrading the roaster and the rest on maintenance and a large storage facility for manganese (which is treated for a few weeks each year). The company’s main activities will be the manufacture of fertilizers. [Photo of Ian Gemmell and Burra Plant Manager Nick Van Buuren.]</p>

<p>National Trust 22nd AGM was held at the Burra Civic Centre on 3 March.</p>
<p>Chairman Maureen Wright reported on the past year. The major project had been the Bon Accord Mine Site &amp; Museum. A grant of $11,283 came from the History Trust of SA and $30,000 from Burra’s Jubilee 150 grant, combined with much voluntary labour to produce a fine museum display. Colin Fidock was responsible for the preparation of the graphics and pictures – a job requiring much research and most of his spare time. Pam Marlow’s Monster Mine Model is one of the highlights of the museum. The Branch has recently applied to the History Trust of SA for an archaeological study leading to a better understanding of the Bon Accord history.</p>
<p>In 1987 the branch will undertake further restoration work at Redruth Gaol, funded by the Commonwealth Bank. It is one of six sites in Australia to be funded as part of their $500,000 ‘Heritage 88 Project’ and represents SA’s portion.</p>
<p>This $50,000 will enable much needed restoration and upgrading of the approach to the gaol and to the car park.</p>
<p>This year saw the installation of enamel interpretive signs at all our main sites and identification signs. A grant of $1,500 from the Department of Tourism was matched by the Burra National Trust.</p>
<p>In 1986 Mr John restored Burra’s first [motorised] fire engine – a Model T Ford. The MFS believes it is SA’s oldest motorised fire engine and the oldest Model T fire engine in Australia. The other two fire engines owned by the Branch took part in the Bay to Birdwood Run last year – the Diamond T and the Denis. On the drive home the 1936 Diamond T clocked up its first 5,000 miles.</p>
<p>The Branch now urgently needs a building to house them. Elected: Chairman, Maureen Wright; Vice-Chairman Management, Helen Stockman; Vice-Chairman Works &amp; Buildings, Barry Wright; Vice-Chairman Fundraising &amp; Catering, Audrey Little; Secretary, Robyn Page and Treasurer pro tem Avian Pink.</p>

<p>The Bon Accord Mine Site &amp; Museum is entered for a Regional Tourism Award.</p>
<p>Owned by the Burra Branch of the National Trust, the ‘Bon’ received some $30,000 from the Jubilee 150 Board last year and the Burra National Trust branch added a further $19,000 so that the building could be restored and displays installed. Visitors today can see the 300 foot Bon Accord shaft, from which Burra drew its water supply for many years. The Bon Accord Mining Co.’s lease bordered that of the SA Mining Association’s hugely successful Burra Burra Mine. The Bon Accord buildings were completed in 1859, but despite all efforts no deposit of copper was found. There is yet 100 years of waterworks history to be discovered at the ‘Bon’ and some archaeological studies are yet to be undertaken. It has just been announced that the ‘Bon’ has received a Community Development grant of almost $20,000 to ensure that work continues for some time. The site is on the register of State Heritage Items and is registered by the National Trust of SA. The Bon accord Mine Engineer’s Workshop is also on the State heritage Register and classified by the National Trust. The Bon Accord residence and pumphouse is registered by the National Trust.</p>

<p>Morphett’s Enginehouse is an entry in the Mid North Tourism Awards. The rebuilding of the enginehouse is believed to be the first of its kind in the world. It is due to funding from the Jubilee 150 Board, the Department of Mines &amp; Energy, the Department of tourism and the Burra Burra DC. It stands among other ruins on the lip of the open cut. Some of Burra’s elderly folk who witnessed its burning in 1926 can scarcely believe its transformation. It originally housed a Cornish beam engine and was built in 1858 to facilitate the de-watering of the mine. Its huge pump moved at 8 strokes per minute and raised 3 million gallons of water per day. The three interior chambers have been rebuilt with a large cut-out representing the huge 80 inch cylinder which once worked there. Many displays centred upon Cornish beam engines have been placed there and visitors can get a commanding view of the modern open cut and its lake from the top floor. The building’s environs are equally fascinating. The excavated miners’ adit now gives people access to the 600 foot deep Morphett’s Shaft. In walking through the tunnel people are treading on timbers that have lain there for 140 years, some of them charred from the 1926 fire. Around the area are archaeological artefacts, interpretive signs, Morphett’s Whim House and the old reservoir.</p>

A display of the town’s history by Kim Brereton was a huge success. Everyone enjoyed cartoons of the 1940’s by ‘HEK’. The oldest visitor was Dora Wade 84 and she cut the cake, helped by Flo Blieschke, Laurel Neill and Kim Brereton. Organiser Pat Brereton was pleased with the success.</p>

The budget was cut this year and there are mandatory 1-2% cuts for next year. CEO John Chilton said the daily bed cost at Burra was currently $107 compared with up to $300 at some metropolitan hospitals. The community was urged to write to health authorities and government representatives about this serious situation.</p>
<p>Burra National Trust has been given a grant of $19,995 to assist with upgrading buildings and grounds of the historic Bon Accord Mine Site. This was announced by Neil Andrew, Federal Member for Wakefield. The Branch will contribute $5,025.</p>

<p>Derek Rayfield of Burra North writes re the Burra Creek Plan. The Burra Creek certainly needed tidying up, but does it need a plan orchestrated by our former engineer for the Council and estimated at 1986 prices to cost $186,000? The burden will largely fall on Burra ratepayers in the form of yet another large loan and the cost will also fall on residents of Booborowie, Farrell Flat and Mt Bryan, though the Council does little to improve those townships. Surely it is time for a public meeting and for work to be done when funds become available and not by going into another enormous debt.</p>
<p>Jim Dempsey writes thanking all who organised the Back to Hanson for their great effort. He returned after 30 years absence and found it great to meet so many old friends. It was 50 years since he did his QC examination at Hanson School in 1937 and the whole of that class was present: Jacqueline Hogan, Jane Canny, Bernice Dixon, Margaret Rogers and himself.</p>
<p>Miss Mabel Cottage is an entrant for a Mid North Region Tourism Award. It stands near Redruth Gaol in the area formerly known as Llwychr [sic]. It was built at least 125 years ago. By 1851 more than 5,000 people were living in the towns around the mine and Burra was then the largest [inland] provincial centre in Australia. Miss Mabel was born in the cottage in 1883, the 12th of 13 children of Samuel and Ann Baker (nee Edwards). Samuel had married Ann, the daughter of a Welsh smelter, in 1862 and they moved to the Penglawdd Street cottage soon after. Samuel outlived Ann by three years, dying in 1938 aged 98. Miss Mabel lived there until just before her death in 1983 in her 100th year. The cottage has changed little since her death. It retains the charm of country life as she would have known it. Miss Mabel loved fruit and flowers and the garden has been replanted with heritage roses, fruit trees and herbs and the old pines and pepper trees remain. Accommodation is available for up to six people in three double bedrooms and the pantry is well stocked. There is a well-appointed kitchen, a spacious dining area and sitting room and visitors are greeted with freshly cut flowers and a bottle of Clare Valley wine.</p>

<p>Donna &amp; Bryan Salter are entered for the Mid North Tourism Awards in the Tourism Services Category.</p>
<p>They are lessees of the Bon Accord Mine Museum. Every Hour they conduct a tour of the Bon Accord and seek to build up a picture of how miners worked and of the conditions at the mine.

<p>Burra Burra DC: Meet the Candidates</p>
<p>Chris Reed is married with two children and involved in the family farming business. The reed family has been in Burra for five generations. He has been much involved in community activities, having been Chairman of the Coppertown Festival, and secretary of the Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push. With the downturn in the rural economy the town has to develop tourism to maintain services and employment. Rationalisation of Council plant and staff and services has been the right step. The Council needs to be efficient if it is to keep its identity in the face of threatened Council amalgamations.</p>
<p>Gary Donaldson is a professional wood-turner and has lived in Burra for two years as co-proprietor of the award-winning Cousin Jack’s. He was formerly a supervisor trainer with the E &amp; WS Department and has extensive experience in management, customer contact and presentation techniques training. He advocates open government and is a strong supporter of Burra’s destiny as a quality tourism product.</p>
<p>Barry Wright has been a Burra North resident for four years. He and his wife own a wool and skin business and have renovated the old Sara’s Store, which now operates as Sara’s Secondhand Goods and Clothes. Before coming to Burra they successfully published and distributed a set of navigation charts of the River Murray upstream of Renmark. Barry is an active member of the Burra National Trust and has been involved in community projects like the Copper Festival. He sees his role in Council as promoting better communication with the public and more business enterprise in the district.</p>
<p>Stephen Downs-Woolley is 32 and has lived in the town for seven years. He is a former police officer and sees the town’s future as a major tourist business centre. He is a past President of Apex and has served on the Kindergarten and other committees, including the Barrow Push, Jubilee 150, Trade Train and Copper Festival.</p>
<p>Derek Rayfield is the son of a London cabbie and was in the RAF and private business before migrating in 1969 and becoming a member of the RAAF. He is married with three children and three grandchildren. He has lived in Burra since 1978. He has been involved with Senior Citizens and the National Trust and id the Secretary of the Caring and Sharing Group and of the Burra Preservation Organisation. He is also an active member of the elderly visitation program. He would, in Council, seek to prevent financial negligence, encourage community involvement in major decisions and seek to maintain roads, footpaths and erect toilets in Burra North.</p>
<p>Robyn Page comes originally from Parramatta in NSW and came to SA with her family in 1969. She gained her B Ed and with her husband came to Burra in 1981. They have one son. She has since been involved in many community activities. She is particularly keen to see the community involved in decision making and seeks a balance between development of tourism and heritage aspects of Burra.</p>
<p>Jenny O’Connor is 46 and a mother of five. She is Burra’s Tourist Officer and is descended from a family with Burra connections over 6 generations. She has had a ten year connection with Burra Scouting and five years as leader of the Cubs. She has an interest in improving facilities for the young of the district. She also has a long connection with Senior Citizens (Her mother Mrs Ryan was President of the Pensioners’ Group for 17 years before the Senior Citizens was established). She has been a member of the National Trust for 18 years and a school bus driver for 13. She is committed to the town’s heritage and sees tourism as Burra’s industry of the future. She believes in open communication.</p>

<p>Sale. The former Smelters’ Home Hotel, also known as Opie’s Flats, will be auctioned by elders on 2 May. It began as a hotel in 1849 when Mr J. Robins was licensee. It was then newly built, standing at the extreme northern end of section 1 – the original section taken by the SA Mining Association. After changing hands several times, the licence passed to W. Woollacott in 1861 (famous for hauling the giant boiler from Pt Adelaide to Burra on the jinker now housed adjacent to Market Square). The Opie family acquired it in 1863 and it became known as Opie’s Hotel. It was de-licensed about 19221. Ian Auhl says it is believed to be the oldest hotel in SA still in its original condition, having been converted into flats just by closing doors along a passageway leading from the bar to the rear of the building. It retains its shingle roof under the galvanised iron. The walls are eighteen inches thick and there is a large dry cellar under the bar. The building has casement windows throughout2. The building has eighteen rooms and is of about 40 squares set on an acre of land with more than 200 foot frontage to the Barrier Highway. There is a large underground tank and the remains of a stone stable. It is on the recorded list of the National Trust. The current owners are Gerry &amp; Carmel O’Connor.</p>
<p>[1It closed in 1917 and the licence was transferred to the Booborowie Hotel.</p>

They will operate an authorised Ford Parts, Service and Warranty outlet, acting as agents for Vanstone Ford of Clare.</p>
<p>Mt Bryan Uniting Church, formerly Methodist Church, will celebrate fifty years of the church building on 3 May with an 11 a.m. service conducted by Rev. Gowan Armstrong, who served there in the 1950s when it was part of the Hallett-Terowie Methodist Circuit. A pooled luncheon will follow in the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall and then there will be a Pleasant Sunday Afternoon.</p>
<p>The red brick building was erected to replace a wood and iron structure dating from 1913. This structure then became the Sunday School Hall. When the red brick building was opened it was used by two congregations, which merged into one – the congregation from the wood and iron building and the one from the former Bible Christian Chapel, built in 1871 and still standing about 2 km northeast of the town. It is believed that the declining population in the district prompted the merger. A short history of Methodism in the Mt Bryan District has been written and will be available on 3 May.</p>

<p>Burra Community Library held its AGM.</p>
<p>Librarian Colin Fidock gave a comprehensive survey of the nine years of the Community Library’s existence. Over this period the enrolment has been fairly steady at about 59.2% of the population of the district. Statistics show that the library’s collection was well-used. A video pilot scheme had been well received and should be budgeted for in the future (though no provision had been made for 1987-88). Improved services had been made available for the Burra Hospital from 1985. In 1986 the goal of providing a local history room had been achieved. In 1986 more than 87 requests to do research in this collection had been made and in addition school students used the resource. Shirley Thamm and Debbie Brown had continued their Burra Obituary Project.</p>
<p>Library Depots operated at Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat. The library’s 8th birthday was highlighted with the publication of Relatively Speaking. The Jubilee 150 year had been a busy one with a number of displays and the completion of the local history room.</p>

<p>Obituary.</p>
<p>The Burra community was saddened to hear of the death of Edward Thomas Baulderstone late last week, following a long illness.</p>
<p>The last Mayor of the Corporation of Burra prior to its amalgamation with the District Council of Burra in 1969, Ted’s contribution to the public and community life of this town deserves recognition.</p>
<p>Born in 1904, Ted lived his young years at Scott Creek in the Adelaide Hills. The eldest of six children, he left school aged 13 and began working in a market garden.</p>
<p>He and his wife, plus the eldest of their children, came to Burra in 1931 during the Depression years, to establish a country market for the fruit and vegetables he grew in the Adelaide Hills. Over the next few years, he established a green grocery business here.</p>
<p>In 1946 he became a Councillor in the Corporation of Burra, and between 1954 and 1969 was Mayor.</p>
<p>His achievements during those years were many, but the more notable was the building of the St John Ambulance Centre, and the development of the Burra Oval.</p>
<p>However, probably the most visionary of all his work related to the Corporation’s purchase of the old Burra Mine area with a view to its preservation and development into a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>Happily, he saw much conservation and development take place over the ensuing years and was very pleased with the Burra Heritage Town Jubilee project’s work in that area. Ted was always interested in history and heritage-they were great loves of his.</p>
<p>He became immersed in the work of preserving Paxton&rsquo;s Square and again was rewarded by seeing the Square develop onto a fine accommodation area.</p>
<p>He was a member of the former Lewis Trust, and was treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management which administers the Square, right up until his death.</p>
<p>In 1985, the town showed its appreciation to him by awarding him the Australia Day Citizen of the Year Award.</p>
<p>To name all the committees and groups with which Ted was associated over his life in Burra would be a monumental task, but suffice to say he was a very public-minded citizen, and retained an astute interest in the affairs of the town right up until his death.</p>
<p>To the Baulderstone family is offered the condolences and sympathy of the community.</p>
<p>Ted always acknowledged the support given him by his wife Doreen, who predeceased him by some three years, over his public life. He is survived by four sons and three daughters, and their families.</p>
<p>[Edward (Ted) Thomas Baulderstone born 1 September 1904 Clarence Park: died 30 April 1897 Elizabeth.]</p>

<p>The Bush Picnic Race Meeting Committee presented cheques on Friday at a dinner at the Burra Hotel. Chairman John Maidment presented a cheque for $2,500 to the Chairman of the Aged Persons Hostel Committee, Ray Jennison. Les Saunders presented a cheque for $2,600 to the RFDS. A 1988 meeting is already being planned.</p>
<p>Jennison’s Tyre Service will cease trading on 15 May. The Jennison family connection with Burra’s automotive businesses stretches back to 1922 when Ray’s father, Horton Jennison was the BMC dealer. In 1956 Ray returned to Burra from Adelaide and the Jennisons then applied for the Ford dealership. The wool industry was booming and branching into the automotive business in Burra was timely. Horton Jennison died in 1967. In the early days of the business it operated from the section of the building adjacent to Pearce’s Buildings. The rest of the building was purchased from the late Glen Finch in 1960. Later the firm bought the Eastern Telegraph [actually Telephone] Exchange on the south side of Commercial Street, which many will recall had housed the Air Force Clubrooms on the top floor. This building was demolished to make way for the car yard. The remaining business area on the south side as we know it today was purchased from H.C. Davies in 1958 and from C.J. Pearce &amp; Son in 1966. In 1978 the Toyota dealership was added. Disaster struck in August 1985 when fire destroyed the section of building closest to Pearce’s Buildings. This was rebuilt. Ray Jennison is the third longest serving Ford dealer principal in SA. He was a member of the Ford National Dealer Council for some 13 years. In 1964 Jennison’s began business in Clare and leased that business from 1969-72. Between 1972 and 1978 he again operated it, until selling to Clare Valley Motors. Ray has also had an active involvement in the community. His retirement closes a long chapter in Burra’s Commercial history. From 19 May Neal Webster and Andrew Nourse, currently on the staff of Jennison’s Tyre Service, will begin business as Burra auto Repairs and will operate as authorised Ford Part &amp; Warranty outlet from an entrance off Kangaroo Street. The rest of the premises on the south side of Commercial Street will be leased to Elders Pastoral.</p>
<p>[Photo of Ray Jennison and another of the western part of the premises on the north side of Commercial Street said to be taken in 1925. It is a little odd that no mention was made in this article of the changes to the business reported in the Review Times Record, 68, 1, 31 October 1985, page 2 where it says that the tyre part of the business had recently been sold to Ron &amp; Geraldine Smedley and that the new business would operate as Burra Tyres.]</p>

<p>Burra Golf Club has spent c. $12,000 on further development of the course. Pipes have been laid to all tee blocks and all areas around the blacks, so that they can be grassed. This began when the club combined with the Leighton Cricket Club to lay a pipeline from the Bon Accord Mine shaft to the Aberdeen Oval and the golf course. The Golf Club committee installed a large tank from which water can be reticulated.</p>
<p>Polly’s Tea Room, run by Anna &amp; Hank Bernhard, is a popular place and their recently introduced miner’s lunch comprising pea soup, a Cornish pasty and apple crumble with cream has been a hit. The chance to see the old Burra Record printing office is another attraction.</p>

<p>Burra Swimming Pool Board of Management AGM was held last Thursday night. Chairman John Barton reported on the year. The committee had operated with a set Council budget of $7,000. The 1986-87 summer had been unusually cold and gate takings for 92 days had been $3,534.40, while operating costs had been $3,754.49, to give a deficit of $217.08. [The figures cited give a deficit of $220.09.]</p>
<p>For the coming season the pool had been re-painted at a cost of $3,500, so this financial year is expected to end with a deficit of c. $1,500 over the Council’s budgeted deficit of $7,000. This sum will be drawn from the Swimming Pool Committee’s fund raising account. Elected: Chairman, John Barton; Secretary, Jan. Jacka and Treasurer, John Brak.</p>

<p>Elders Pastoral will celebrate the centenary of their sheep sales in Burra this year with records showing the first sale at the present saleyards site was on 25 November 1887 when some 15,000 sheep and 420 cattle were offered. The two storey Elders office building is now the Tourist Information Centre. The land for the saleyards was acquired from James Shakes and John Lewis at a cost of £518-15-0. The original red and blue gum post and rail sheep yards cost £120-16-0.</p>
<p>In 1902 a newspaper report says Burra was then recognised as the principal market in SA and Elder, Smith &amp; Co. decided to erect their own yards. The then new yards were designed to hold 40,000 sheep and at the recent off-shears sale 44,000 sheep were offered and sold.</p>
<p>Elder’s first Burra office were modest facilities at the rear of Drew &amp; Crewes’ Store. Tenders were called for the two storey office in 1890 and it was open for business in 1891. They moved to their recently vacated offices after merging with Goldsbrough Mort in the 1960s. In 1887 the flat rate of commission was 6.5% and in 1890 Elders at Burra sold 204,898 sheep. Records show that up to 1892 the total number of sheep sold by agents at Burra exceeded 500,000 per annum. One record about 1890 reports a private sale of 19,995 two-toothed ewes sold for 17/9 each and one injured one at 3/-, revealing a generation that expected nothing and gave nothing.</p>
<p>In 1906 one of the first pieces of high-tech equipment was introduced to the office – a typewriter. In 1904 the office took delivery of its first motor vehicle, but horses and buggies were retained till 1917.</p>

The road itself was never well constructed and the seal consequently continually broke down, making maintenance costs exorbitant. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Mine Management Committee held its first AGM on 5 August and Chairman Helen Stockman presented the first annual report. The committee was formed to operate Morphett’s Enginehouse and develop the Burra Mine site. The first year had seen experimentation with the hours of opening for the Enginehouse, the training of guides and the appointment of a site manager. Much work had also been done on management, conservation policy, promotion and publicity. To the end of July 1987 there had been visits by 3,155 adults, 243 children, 589 families and 307 pensioners. In addition there were some tourist bus groups and students.</p>
<p>In May the History Trust had granted $2,000 for a cataloguing and registration of portable artefacts on the site. The recent DEP grant of some $104,137 towards a total project of $130,703 will enable much more conservation and some walking trails to be undertaken.</p>

<p>Local History Room Opened</p>
<p>This was built last year in the form of a mezzanine floor adjacent to the Burra Community Library and was funded jointly by the Sa Libraries Board, the Education Department and the Burra Burra DC. Chairman of the Burra Community Library Board of Management Sue Warnes welcomed everyone and introduced librarian Colin Fidock. He said:</p>
<p>History was a reflection of lives. Local History was a heritage we handed on to following generations. Ian Auhl the teacher and historian was able to see how significant the discovery of copper and the growth of the Burra Mine was to SA, but also to the growth of and in the lives of those who lived and will live in this district. The people of Burra were indebted to his dedication and conviction. He had given so much of his life in showing how proud Australians should be of this remarkable town. The Local History Room holds in perpetual trust the life work of Ian Auhl in a notable collection of indexes, references, books and photographs of Burra and District, along with genealogical references of great significance to family history researchers and access to state records via microfilm and fiche, supplemented now by the two publications ‘Let’s Not Forget’ and ‘Relatively Speaking’.</p>
<p>Colin went on to acknowledge the efforts of Ian and Eva Auhl, the late Ann Perry, Shirley Thamm, Margaret Henderson, Di Day, Debbie Brown, Tess Hopkins, Chris McCabe, Cynthia Burnett and Roger Henderson for his belief in, and striving for such a special room. He also thanked the bodies who had funded it.</p>
<p>Chris McCabe was then called upon to open the room in the absence of Ian Auhl who was prevented from attending by illness. He read a speech prepared by Ian Auhl for the occasion. Ian recalled the lack of library facilities when he had first come to Burra in the 1960s and referred to the marvellous Community Library now in place. He too thanked those who had worked to bring together this collection of Burra’s History.</p>
<p>He said that when he had come to Burra in 1964 he knew nothing of its History except that he had been born here in 1914. Though he had then written nothing, he was hooked on Burra from the moment he arrived. He said he had told the story up to 1877 so there was plenty yet to research and more of the story to be told. This history room is the starting place for that story.</p>
<p>Before Chris cut the ribbon to open the room, Roger Henderson, past Principal of BCS performed a short acknowledgement and read two citations to accompany framed photographs of Ian Auhl and Colin Fidock.</p>
<p>The opening of the room coincided with the ninth birthday of the Burra Community Library.</p>

<p>Burra’s 110th Show* will be opened on 10 October by Ms June Appleby MP who is deputising for the Minister of Agriculture Mr Kym Mayes.</p>
<p>[*The correction of this repeatedly made error becomes tedious. The correct figure cannot be obtained by subtracting 1877 from the present year. The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time. The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought. (The event returned in 1915.) Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II. The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event.]</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Board recently presented the 110th annual report. Harry Quinn said the 1986-87 year had been one of change and challenge. It had been a time of financial restraint and increasing demand. All hospitals faced a 1% budget cut after allowing for only a 4% inflation rate. Burra was one of the cheapest hospitals in the state on the basis of cost per occupied bed day and had felt the cuts more than some places with ‘fat’ to cut. Additional monies had to be sought to balance the budget. During the year the part-time physiotherapist was not replaced and one trainee nurse position was cut. Community support had been ongoing and was much valued. Meals on wheels continued to provide a service for an increasing frail aged population. The Ladies’ Auxiliary enabled the hospital to buy much needed equipment. During the year the SA Health Commission proposed to remove obstetric and neo-natal from all country hospitals, but after community response any change appears to have been deferred for the time being. SA Health refused to update laundry equipment and the hospital has transferred laundry services to Central Linen, effecting a saving in salaries and goods and services. This reduced the need for voluntary sewing women who had worked for years for the hospital. He thanked Mrs Florrie Scroop and her helpers for all their efforts over the years. Burra St John Ambulance Service had donated a $2,900 patient lifter. Bathroom floors had been resurfaced and several other safety initiatives undertaken. Unfortunately requests for funding for an Aged Persons Hostel near the hospital were unsuccessful. The casualty and outpatient area needed expansion due to increased tourist traffic. There had been no major building improvements for fourteen years. Stronger approaches to SA Health were needed for more equitable funding for expenses and capital works.</p>

<p>The CEP workers at the mine discovered an interesting archaeological relic last week. It appears to be a driving mechanism for the crushers adjacent to the ore dressing tower. Archaeologist David Bannear says it is one of the few pieces if engine to remain intact and to have escaped the scrapping process of the early twentieth century. It will be transferred to the Bon Accord Mine Museum. The CEP scheme will run for 28 weeks and cost a total of $135,000. [Photo of Mark Charles and the piece of machinery.]</p>

The mining project team led by Nick van Buuren had met a demanding schedule, bringing the mining and processing into production this week. Almost 50 people were employed at Mt Gunson and this secured the future operations at Burra, which employed another 40. Most of these 80-90 people came from the Burra district. Over lunch the board met a number of local guests, many of them were farmers. Mr Ken Williams, Chairman of the Board, was able to tell them of recent changes in fertilizer and agricultural product activities. The company was changing from a South Australian supplier to a national supplier of fertilizers and was entering an exciting period of growth.</p>

<p>The Lewis Board of Management Chairman Andrew Gebhardt said at the recent AGM that Paxton Square had had a financially profitable year. In July the board paid back $50,000 of its original loan of $100,000 borrowed for the Bridge Street [Terrace] row of cottages. The cottages were enjoying increasing visitor traffic. In the past twelve months the board had been saddened by the death of Mr Ted Baulderstone. They would continue with his vision and continue to develop Paxton Square. The three cottages gutted by fire last year had been repaired, though there was still ongoing discussion with the insurance adjuster about weather damage between the time of the fire and the time work was completed on repairs – a period of about 9-10 months.</p>
