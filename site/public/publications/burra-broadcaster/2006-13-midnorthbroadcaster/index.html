<p>Burra Railway Station</p>

<p>SA Underwater Training School has been in Burra for seven years, but its director, Martin Phillips says government subsidies were needed to retain courses and interest in the industry. The school provides international accreditation under the Australian Diving Accreditation Scheme. After a two month training course graduates could almost be guaranteed a job earning up to $50,000 immediately, but at c. $8,000 the course was too costly. They could be training up to 36 students a year, but are currently running only two courses per annum, turning out 12 students. At this rate the school’s prospects of continuing for more than a couple of years seem slim. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Residents at a Public Meeting last Wednesday night gave the Goyder Council a clear message that it was unacceptable to proceed with plans to redevelop Market Square and Best Place. The Council called the meeting to gauge opinion before the final decision to continue or abandon the project was made at the Council meeting on 16 May. The plans involved major changes in Market Square, including the establishment of a major car parking area in the Town’s main street, a more direct traffic route and a slight repositioning of the rotunda to allow widening of the main road. Planning Officer John Brak explained that the plans had been made possible by a grant of monies from Planning SA and the monies were specifically for projects that rejuvenated regional centres, increased local income from tourism and reclaimed space from traffic, roads and car parks.</p>
<p>After public consultation in September 2004 Council had consultants Hames Sharley outline master plans and by July last year final engineering plans were completed by K.B.R. Consulting.</p>
<p>An estimated 170 people attended and many spoke against the plans after being told the finer details, particularly concerning costs. So far about $90,000 had been spent. CEO Steve Kerrigan said the predicted cost was $1,330,000 with 50% met by a Planning SA Grant, 50% from the Council and township – 25% by town ratepayers and 25% by the rest of the Goyder area. This would mean a projected rate rise of $43.50 a year over the next 20 years. Considerations raised included:</p>
<p>Cost.</p>
<p>Changes to parking with seven car parking spaces lost between Commercial Street Corner and Gaslight [Mt Pleasant Rd.] and a total loss of 13 spaces.</p>
<p>Paul Wilson said there was more to Burra’s retail area than Market Square – why wasn’t the whole area involved?</p>
<p>Others looked to the state of footpaths and gutters in dangerous disrepair and questioned the Council’s priorities.</p>
<p>How would Landmark be able to unload stock with the removal of the parking space currently used, to allow for a wider two-way road? A Council spokesperson said there would be room (with trucks backing in from Thames St) and that the changes had been engineered for traffic safety. The movement of the rotunda would make the room needed.</p>
<p>Brian Christie asked whether B-double trucks could make the turn into Market Street from Commercial Street in the event of the bypass being blocked.</p>
<p>Maureen Wright questioned the whole consultation process – fine tuning details now being discussed should have been sorted out long ago.</p>
<p>The Council Chairman said that it was not often that they got the chance for a 50-50 subsidy.</p>
<p>Thym Bitter and Geraldine Smedley moved that the project be discontinued and after much discussion the motion was carried with a huge majority.</p>
<p>Most Burra Ward Councillors indicated that although this decision was not binding on them, they would vote with the feelings of the community.</p>
<p>At the Council meeting on Tuesday a motion was carried against the plan to redevelop Market Square and Best Place.</p>

<p>David Scholz of Eudunda wrote a long letter about vandalism committed by young people at Eudunda – apparently sparked by an attack on floral tributes from Anzac Day at the war memorial there.</p>
<p>Peter and Rosemary Opperman wrote expressing disappointment at the way the public meeting re Market Square and Best Place was conducted. They had attended the meeting with the view that the project should be stopped, but:</p>
<p>The Chairman had begun by implying that if the changes did not proceed, no money could or would be spent on the area.</p>
<p>They were amazed by the unpreparedness of Council delegates in answering most of the questions.</p>
<p>Snide remarks about the way Oppy’s and Landmark have to offload supplies in the street were unnecessary, given that several other businesses have to do the same.</p>
<p>Above all the condescending and sometimes hostile manner of several Council delegates towards community members was most disappointing.</p>
<p>Teresa Earle also wrote on the same topic, saying she was disappointed by the disrespect and sarcasm shown by individuals from the community and from the Council and by the fact that the questions asked didn’t seem to have been researched so that answers could be given. She thought it a bad model for children and that the money could have been better spent on strategies for youth employment in the area.</p>
<p>Evan Hawke wrote also – expressing the view that compared with question time in Federal Parliament, it was an emotive, but well controlled meeting ‘with a bit of name calling and veiled threats’.</p>

<p>Editorial. The editor considers that the decision of about 170 people at a public meeting in Burra that has caused the Regional Council to shelve plans to redevelop Market Square and Best Place represents a lost opportunity to update the town’s centre. Was it all for the cost of a surcharge on the rates of $43.50 p.a. for twenty years? Or was it more due to an acute breakdown in communication between Council and ratepayers.</p>

<p>Ruth Norris, with the help of locals and some tourists, has rescued an abandoned horse at Burra North. The previous owners of the horse left the town some years ago and were under the impression it was being cared for. It was in fact starving and needed other treatments – especially for arthritis. The horse has now recovered and is doing well. [Photos.]</p>

<p>The line form Jamestown was opened in December 1880 and it has been to hold a weekend of celebration from Friday 9 June. The line’s history in a nutshell (with six photographs):</p>
<p>C. 1875 the first European settlement in the area took place on Section 216 Hundred of Yongala.</p>
<p>1874 the Pt Pirie to Crystal Brook line was built.</p>
<p>December 1875 the Crystal Brook line was opened – initially being worked by gravity from Crystal Brook to Pt Pirie and by horses in the other direction. The steam locomotives arrived a month later, with the first steam power used on 31 January 1876.</p>
<p>9 November 1876 the line reached Gladstone and the formal opening was on 7 December 1876.</p>
<p>19 January 1878 the line was extended to Caltowie.</p>
<p>26 May 1878 the line reached Jamestown and was opened for public use 15 July 1878.</p>
<p>December 1879 work began on extending the line to Petersburg.</p>
<p>14 December 1880 the line from Jamestown reached the site that would become Petersburg (later renamed Peterborough). This official opening coincided with the official opening by Governor Jervois of the broad gauge line from Hallett to Terowie.</p>
<p>11 May 1881 the narrow gauge line from Terowie to Petersburg opened.</p>
<p>22 November 1881 the narrow gauge line from Petersburg to Orroroo was officially opened.</p>
<p>May 1882 the line was extended to Quorn, to coincide with the opening of the Pt Augusta to Farina railway.</p>
<p>The narrow gauge line to Cockburn reached there 2 January 1887 and on 14 June 1887 was opened to public traffic.</p>
<p>This line was originally operated by X and Y Class locomotives, with the T Class becoming the mainstay from 1903 to the 1960s, boosted by Australian Standard Garratts from the early 1950s and by the 400 Class Garratts from 1953. 830 Class diesel-electrics were introduced in 1963.</p>
<p>Petersburg then became the narrow gauge hub in the north, with its administrative headquarters, workshops and servicing centre for steam and later diesel-electric locomotives, running sheds, freight depot, station and refreshment rooms, roundhouse and (later) bogie exchange facility. It also developed hostels and housing for hundreds of workers and their families.</p>
<p>Petersburg/Peterborough was a vital link for travellers and freight between Adelaide and Alice Springs and between Sydney and Perth and for Broken Hill-Pt Pirie ore traffic. At one time it had up to 120 trains a day passing through.</p>
<p>1964-70 the Broken Hill to Pt Pirie line was standardised.</p>
<p>Page 4 of the Peterborough Times carried a BankSA and Steamtown article with the photograph of a restored inspection car.</p>
<p>Page 5 of the Peterborough Times carried an article on the memorial to railway workers who lost their lives at work. And an article on Bob the Railway Dog.</p>
<p>Page 6 of the Peterborough Times carried an article on Ore Trains and the last ballast train out of Radium Hill in July 1964. The Radium Hill line opened 1953-54 (narrow gauge) and closed in 1964 as standard gauge, having been used to cart ballast for the Cockburn-Peterborough rail standardisation. The line had officially been closed in January 1962 and its station closed February 1962.</p>

<p>Letter. Stephen Boyes writes complaining of the lack of a specific Burra section in the paper, whereas there is such for Eudunda and Peterborough.

He warns that if this continues the paper will have no Burra readers or advertisers.</p>

<p>Burra Passport</p>
<p>Last week the National Trust presented the Goyder Council with a proposal to simplify the administration of the Burra Heritage Passport. It proposes to revamp the current lease of heritage sites from the Council to the National Trust. Council is asked to consider handing management and administration of all Burra heritage sites to the National Trust and for the National Trust to be fully responsible for the passport product and the management of all its income. 30% of passport income would go to the maintenance of Council owned sites and 30% to National Trust sites. 10% would go in marketing and promotion and 5% for administration and infrastructure. The remaining 25% would cover commission, grant applications and other opportunities. Appropriate boundaries for Council sites would need to be defined (the local rubbish dump is currently attached to the National Trust’s lease). The National Trust hopes for a solution within a few months. Concerns have since been raised regarding the Burra Visitor Centre’s role and capacity within the National Trust scheme. Since 2003 the Centre has been run by BRTBA and has been the sole sales outlet for the Burra Passport Product. The national Trust’s proposal would see it remain a major player in tourism, but not necessarily the sole outlet for the Passport. Manager Andrew Glen was concerned about the financial implications for the Visitor Centre and the future administration of the Passport Product – where would commissions on the Passport go? Burra Visitor Board of Management Chairman, Brenton Greenslade said the Centre operated on a break-even budget. BRTBA is also concerned and is happy with the present management of Passport sales. Another worry is that regional tourism in SA has seen a 20% fall this year. BRTBA took over the Centre in 2003 when the National Trust decided not to renew its lease. Since then it has doubled its membership fees, sought corporate sponsorship and increased its membership dramatically to more than 70.</p>

<p>Goyder Council will have to change the structure of its Development Assessment Panels, following recent amendments to legislation. They expect it to raise significant problems. The panels will now have seven members and one independent chairperson. The aim is to make decisions more efficient. The panels are to have fewer than half elected members, with an equal number of independent experts and an independent member as Presiding Member. Council Planner, John Brak expected finding three independent specialist members for the panels might prove difficult. Goyder Council held that the existing practice of five elected members and three community members as independents or specialists was working well.</p>

<p>David Barker, 6th generation of the Barkers of Baldina grew up on Baldina Station and then moved away for schooling and work. He is thrilled to be back, setting up a new IT business. He and his newly wedded wife Angela will front Regional ITAssist, offering hardware, consulting, service and support. David completed a Certificate III in Information Technology at TAFE and then undertook a Diploma in Information Technology.</p>
<p>The Barker family has been in the district since 1839, when they bought the Burra Hotel. In 1847 they donated it to the community and it became the Burra Hospital, while the family bought Baldina Station.</p>
<p>[These last two sentences are largely fiction. Pastoral Pioneers of South Australia states that Alfred Barker arrived in SA on the brig Rapid along with Colonel Light 21 August 1836. In 1841 he overlanded cattle from NSW and in the 1840s he was in partnership with W.G. Field in the Yankalilla area to the south of Adelaide. Field died in 1852 and it was about then that the family came north.</p>
<p>The Burra Hotel operated from 1846 till 1876. Alfred Barker was the licensee from 1852-58. Ownership of the site would have resided with the SA Mining Association. After running the Burra Hotel Alfred Barker purchased the lease on 33 square miles of country at Baldina from James Humphrey. As far as the Burra hospital is concerned, when the Burra Hotel lease expired in 1876 the community negotiated the purchase of the freehold from the SA Mining Association for conversion of the building to a hospital and unusually for the Association it agreed to sell the freehold to the Burra Town Council. Council approved payment in July 1877 of £583-10-8 including interest.</p>

<p>Just as work was about to start the committee learned that the lease of the Burra Hotel was available to them on advantageous terms. The committee decided that if freehold could be got and the contractor would agree to forego the contract they would prefer the Burra Hotel site.</p>

<p>Editorial. The editor considers that since council amalgamations in 1997 the ‘local’ element in Local Government has seriously weakened. Councillors have less impact on decisions and policy and power has moved to highly paid administrators and higher government direction. If community consultation is held, it seems to have little effect – see consultation on draft budgets for example.</p>

<p>Interview with Len Bence</p>
<p>Len says he wishes he had been born in the period of Pissarro, Monet and Van Gogh. The early impressionists got away from detail and produced a style Len Loves. When he taught oil painting, he would give students a brief look at a painting and then ask them to go away and paint it – they would have only an impression of the image to fall back upon.</p>
<p>Watercolour is Mr Bence’s first preference, but it is difficult and requires great care, as a single mistake screws up the work. Painting in oils is more relaxing – mistakes can be scraped off and corrected. His favourite subjects have been landscapes in Italy and France, but he also loved Burra scenes and its lovely bluestone buildings. About 30 years ago he sold the Drew &amp; Crewes Building in Commercial Street and he and his wife Muriel then ran a gallery in a cottage on Bridge Terrace [in Paxton Square]. At that time it was in poor condition and without electricity – but they did well for some years. He enjoys sketching outdoors, rather than from photographs. Painting has been an occupation and a hobby and he says you needed to view it as a job to be done, even if at times you didn’t feel like it. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>Built in 18751, the Burra Town Hall has had an exciting history. Volunteers are now helping to return it to its turn of the century grandeur. Retired painter, Roy Taplin has volunteered his time to do the renovations, which started about six weeks ago. Changes have included repositioning the back wall of the hall to give more room in the foyer, a new floor [surface] for the entrance and repainting the walls and ceiling of the foyer and the walls of the main hall and its ceiling rose[s]. The old design on the presidiums [sic: for proscenium] will be reproduced and the floor of the main hall will be painted. The refurbished hall will have an official re-opening in October. Volunteers show visitors around the hall with about 1,530 visitors since June 20062.</p>
<p>In the future it is hoped to make the old projector rom available for visitors. The Town Hall Committee and Burra History Group has made a large collection of photographs available for viewing and for sale in the supper room.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor from Adrian Smith, Chairman of the Farrell Flat Management Committee, Aerodrome Sub-Committee.</p>
<p>The sub-committee has spent five years trying to encourage the Goyder Council and the Clare &amp; Gilbert Valley Council to take an interest.</p>
<p>The only airfield in the district is on private land and provides a 750 m dirt strip and one of 450 m.</p>
<p>The committee spent much time with CASA, Transport SA and PIRSA to provide reports to local councils.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in SA, airfields are much more common.</p>
<p>They have concluded that what was needed was a runway 1,500 m to cater for aircraft of 5,700 kg (12-18 passengers).</p>
<p>This meant a new site and one near Hanson was a possibility.</p>
<p>MNRDB seemed uninterested.</p>
<p>Mr Robert Bradley, owner of the present site says it will be resumed for agricultural purposes from 1 December 2006.</p>
<p>Tourist operators regularly express interest in being able to fly in visitors.</p>
<p>Clare &amp; Gilbert Valley Council lost interest as soon as the airfield might be developed outside its area, despite its effort to develop its ‘regional status’.</p>
<p>An airport is important for:</p>
<p>Fire-bombing operations</p>
<p>Crop spraying</p>
<p>Personnel and clients for winemakers and other businesses, including pastoral and farming clients for annual sales and auctions.</p>
<p>RFDS operations</p>
<p>Tourism</p>
<p>Businesses associated with airports – see the examples of Murray Bridge and Goolwa</p>
<p>Conference access</p>
<p>Recreational use by local pilots</p>
<p>Economic viability needs to be tested and a business development plan produced at a cost of c. $10,000. The sub-committee feels that it has gone as far as it can and the matter now needs to be placed in the public area for discussion.</p>

<p>Goyder Council &amp; the National Trust Proposal re Heritage Passports</p>
<p>Council agreed to a 20-year lease of Council Passport sites to the National Trust, but was concerned about a reduction in Burra Visitor Centre’s commission for selling the Passports.</p>
<p>Council favours a new committee to replace the current Passport &amp; Visitors Information Centre Committee, comprising the Mayor (or his nominee), CEO, senior staff member, one Councillor, three members of the National Trust and three from BRTBA.</p>
<p>Council felt that while the sale of Passports beyond Burra would raise its profile, it could result in visitors then relying on the Visitor Centre for information when they arrived, without generating any income from the sales.</p>
<p>Council was concerned over the proposed carve-up of the passport income: 30% to maintenance of Council sites, 30% to maintenance of National Trust sites, 10% to marketing and promotion and 25% other. Council proposed the Visitor Centre receives 20% commission on Passport sales, rather than the 10% proposed by the National Trust and 30% it currently gets. Also the National Trust to provide the Council with an annual report covering maintenance, improvements, marketing and promotions. Council also had some concerns over the National Trust request to be able to approve short-term sub-hire of sites.</p>
<p>Council agreed to insure its own sites, with NTSA to reimburse the cost to Council and agreed to maintain the gravel roads in the Mine site and to define Council site boundaries.</p>

<p>Local Airport. After five years of lobbying, Goyder and Clare &amp; Gilbert Valley Councils have agreed to back a local airport. Bob Bradley, owner of the present airstrip at Farrell Flat, has been concerned about public liability, but says if a suitable arrangement for a lease could be made, he would support the airstrip’s use. The Councils would look at the possibility of filling in a creek, which stops the extension of the 750 m airstrip. The present site is ideally situated.

<p>Burra Passport. The Goyder Council and the National Trust have come to an agreement on the management of the Burra Passport product. Council and the National Trust have a 50% ownership of the product. [Presumably this means ‘each have a 50% ownership’ rather than 50% together.]</p>
<p>Earlier this year the NTSA presented Council with a proposal to continue to manage the passport heritage sites, of which the Council has four and the National Trust has three. The NTSA proposed to redistribute the income:</p>
<p>Maintenance of Council properties 30%</p>
<p>Maintenance of NTSA properties 30%</p>
<p>[After this the article’s distribution of income become unclear, but the proposal was to decrease the commission paid to the Burra Visitor Centre from 30% to 10%. After objections this offer was increased to 15%.]</p>
<p>Council rejected the offer of a 15% commission to the Burra Visitor Centre.</p>
<p>On 5 September Council agreed to a compromise of 17.5% till 30 June 2007, when it will be reviewed.</p>
<p>Council agreed that audited accounts of both the Burra National Trust and the Visitor Centre were needed to assist in the understanding and appreciation of their financial positions.</p>

And there was a lot of washing up as well. Now meals are kept at the right temperature and professionally packed in foil containers. [Photo.]</p>

It has been open to the public several times and last Saturday the owners welcomed visitors to a celebration dance marking the building’s centenary.</p>

<p>Redbanks Conservation Park open day recently attracted large crowds. On Thursday 28 September over 100 students from district schools and 75 community members attended. District Ranger Ian Falkenberg was pleased. Experts were on hand to give information on vegetation, reptiles, birds, and fossil discoveries. Flinders University associate professor Rod Wells and Aaron Cumens from Adelaide University explained some recent discoveries. The fossils here are particularly well preserved. The latest Diprotodon fossil was of a teenaged specimen, which is rare. The first reported discoveries of a Diprotodon were along Baldina Creek in 1889. Since then seven localities have yielded finds of Diprotodons as well as a Tasmanian tiger. The fossil discoveries add a different potential source of tourist development for the district.</p>
<p>Jessie Rooke was 100 on 30 September and celebrated with family and friends in Burra Uniting Church Hall. Jessie grew up on the family farm near World’s End and walked two miles to the local school, where she studied with 25 other students to grade 7. She then worked on the farm, enjoying riding her horse, mustering and drafting sheep. She loved playing tennis at World’s End and dances at Robertstown and Point Pass – to the tunes on an accordion.</p>
<p>On 9 November 1932 she married Ted Rooke in the Kooringa Methodist Church. She still keeps up with activities on the farm ‘Curburra’, which since Ted’s death in 1962 has been managed by Daphne and Peter Mengersen. Jessie always enjoyed clearance sales and shearing time, when she would cook a roast and four veg. She was always a most hospitable person and visitors always got a cup of tea and a welcome. When her father had one of the few cars at World’s End she would drive people to the doctor or into the town, so it became known as the World’s End Taxi. One of her greatest accomplishments was buying land from the Warnes, Woollacott and Villis families and seeing it paid off. Some of the film Breaker Morant was shot on her property in 1979 and Jessie was an extra. She said her century might be due to good clean living, no alcohol, dancing, friendship and hard work, but with a mother who lived to 90 and her father to well over that, it could have been in the genes. [Born Jessie May Finch 30 September 1906, Kooringa: died 8 April 2008, Burra. Actually her father lived to be 90 and her mother died aged 82.]</p>

<p>Brenda Taplin Secretary of the Burra Town Hall Committee writes to thank all who made the re-opening of the Town Hall such a success over the weekend of the 13, 14 &amp; 15 October. She was, however, dismayed to learn that a rumour was circulating that $1.2 million of ratepayers’ money was spent on re-vamping the Town Hall. In fact less than $15,000 was used and that came from a couple of generous donations and hire of the hall. Most work was done by volunteers and anyone with a query is welcome to look over the books with the treasurer Mr Murray Tiver.</p>

<p>The Environment Resources &amp; Development Court has resolved that Goyder Council should reverse its approval of a feedlot application on Princess Royal Station. Simon Rowe said he would appeal the decision. The application for a 1,500 head cattle feedlot was received by the Council two years ago. Council and the Environment Protection Authority approved the proposal. Graham Whetstone &amp; John Lindner challenged this in the ERDC on the grounds that the withdrawal of groundwater would have a significant impact on surrounding properties. The ERDC agreed, but Simon Rowe took the matter to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the ERCD had not considered the matter thoroughly, instead focusing on environmental concerns. After reassessing the case the ERDC has now ruled in favour of Lindner &amp; Whetstone.</p>

<p>Simon Rowe will return to the Supreme Court to appeal the decision to refuse his application for a feedlot on Princess Royal Station. Regional Council of Goyder development assessment panel and the Environmental Protection Agency both granted approval, but neighbours Graham Whetstone and John Lindner went to the Environmental Resources &amp; Development Court (ERDC), which decided in their favour. The Supreme Court then decided the ERDC had not given the matter due consideration and referred it back to them. The ERDC has now re-assessed the appeal and again ruled in favour of Whetstone &amp; Lindner. Whetstone and Lindner are concerned about the deteriorating health of Burra Creek – with tree deaths, permanent pools disappearing, boors dropping and being inconsistent and rising salinity in some bores.</p>
<p>They say more time is needed to collect scientific date before deciding on an approval that would see more water taken for a feedlot.</p>

<p>Jack Coffey, local veterinarian, has worked with engineers to design a device to replace mulesing. The aim was to achieve what happens with elasticator rings, but mulesing requires a longitudinal section of skin to wither and fall off. He has devised a clip that will remove similar areas of skin as are removed in a mulesing operation on either side of the breech and tail. It has worked very well on trials, with very little discomfort and no wound infection. The innovation is now ready to go commercial and should be available sometime in 2007.</p>

<p>Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard</p>
<p>Sir David Attenborough was in the Mid North last week, filming his documentary, Life in Cold Blood.</p>
<p>After a sighting at Marion in 1959 the lizard was believed extinct until a road-killed brown snake was found to have eaten one in 1992. Three years later Barry Read found one on his 80 acre property neighbouring Princess Royal. Since then a ‘Recovery Team’ has been working to ensure the population of the lizard was stabilised. Sir David said he was thrilled to be involved in the Bluetongue cause. Professor Mike Bull of Flinders University is also working with the ‘Recovery Team’. The recovery process seems to be doing well, with the numbers of the lizard rising. Barry Read has established a sanctuary where he first found the reptile in 1995. Local landowner Chris Reed said he had changed his land management practice to minimise any impact on the Bluetongues, but it was no chore to do so. Mr Reed said numbers in the Mid North are now thought to be c. 5,000.</p>

<p>Mr Gobbett grew up in the Riverland, studied in Adelaide and then taught Geography and History in SA before working as a teacher educator in Zimbabwe for eight years and then at UniSA from 1973-95. In 1990 he researched village settlement along the Murray in the 1890s. He was assistant ranger at Gluepot in 2001, which led to researching its history. One of the longest connections with Gluepot is the Warnes family from 1934-63, when Reg Warnes and his son Les lived on nearby Woolgangi. Le and his wife Nan were major contributors to the story. The book includes development since 1997, when Birds of Australia took over the reserve.</p>

<p>Burra Effluent Ponds</p>
<p>Goyder Council is considering establishing a wetlands as a further stage of the effluent treatment system in Burra. Some residents are concerned about nutrients entering the Burra Creek and about smells after rain and a southeast wind. The construction of a further effluent dam has been a hot topic of late. Asset manager, Trevor Wood, says the new dam is part of the total project Council has been working on for years. Water leaving the ponds is tested regularly to ensure it is of a quality suitable for specific agricultural irrigation purposes. The Burra lagoons were constructed in 2003 and recently Council became aware that treated water entering Burra Creek may have led to an algal bloom. Testing proved this not to be the cause. To ensure strict compliance with the health and environment guidelines, the new dam was being constructed. A re-use irrigation system is being considered and possibly a wetland area on the cemetery extension allotment.</p>

<p>The Season. Some local farmers are saying the drought is the worst in their lifetimes. Richard Riggs owns and manages 8,900 ha of land north and east of Burra with his wife Jen and son Tom and he says this is the worst drought in the past 40 years. The local water table is starting to dry up. Upon recently re-equipping a bore that had not been used for 15 years, the static level had fallen from 43 ft to 100 ft. Don Villis at Hallett says the 1982-83 drought was worse and he has plenty of water at 80 to 190 ft. Farmers selling stock have forced the prices down by 60% and slaughter rates for sheep and cattle are up. [Photo of Richard Riggs in a dry dam.]</p>

<p>Jailhouse Rock numbers halved this year. Committee member Sue Ryan said this could be attributed to the change of date this year because the National Motor Museum snatched the usual date for its Rock and Roll Rendezvous. She expected the 10th event in 2008, on the usual date, to see a revival in numbers. It would also move from the Gaol to the Town Hall in 2008, with a better floor, better lighting and greater opportunity to wear more glamourous shoes and outfits. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Girl Guides</p>
<p>Sharon O’Connor &amp; Deb Spackman have called a meeting of girls and parents for 5 February to consult with the State Commissioner Margie Bellman to decide on the future of Guides in Burra. With only a few guides attending, they feel the time has come for a decision. It was disappointing to prepare an activity for eight and to have only three turn up. Guides is designed to operate in three age groups – Gumnuts, Brownies and Guides, but Burra has to run as one group. The end of Guides in Burra would also see the sale of the Hall and others who use the hall would have to seek other accommodation. They had been lucky to keep going for so long, when larger centres like Clare had not, but it was now a make or break time.</p>

He was excellent in that position, taking 14 catches behind the wicket and conceding only 9 byes in ten days of nearly 500 overs of cricket. As a batsman he was very handy as well, scoring two crucial half centuries. SA had the same win-loss record as the two leading sides, but came third on % after Victoria and Queensland.</p>

<p>The Season. The 2006-07 harvest was meagre. In many districts of SA it was worse than in 1982. Around Burra it was a disaster – perhaps 20-30% of normal and around Jamestown perhaps 40%. Shortage of feed means more time, energy and money to support livestock too. Summer weeds had also been a problem, with caltrop and potato weed prevalent in the Booborowie area.</p>

<p>Deputation to Council. At least twelve ratepayers attended the February meeting of Goyder Council, to object to the expiation process as a consequence of not clearing up properties to prevent fire. The objections were to the processes involved, rather than to the demands to clear up properties. Many claimed they had not received the original notice. The fire prevention officer pointed out the anomaly in that they had not failed to receive the expiation notice, sent to the same addresses. Council has agreed to waive expiation of the $160 fine if the properties complied with the notice as of 15 February – and to make refunds if the expiation had been paid.</p>

<p>Accident. A semi-trailer loaded with 93 bales of wool rolled over on the notorious S bends just north of Mt Bryan on 27 February. The accident occurred at 1 p.m. and the clean-up took until 7.45 p.m. This bend at a long gone railway crossing was the site for a rear-end crash in 200, two roll-overs in 2005 and a single vehicle accident in 2006. The cost of removing this unnecessary series of bends could be up to $1 million.</p>

<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery have plans to see a regional palaeontology centre developed in the Burra Railway Station. Before this can happen though, the station needs to be restored and converted. The Railway Station Group is headed by Roger Cross and Peter Harvey and is seeking funds for a Building Survey and Works Project Report. This would enable them to apply for grants. The SA Museum is keen to participate in this project, which would see the site as an educational venue for schools and adult groups and would provide palaeontologists from the SA Museum and Flinders University a base and research area to continue their work at Redbanks. The initial survey is estimated to cost $3,500.</p>

<p>Andrew Bence recalls his time as a National Serviceman in 1969-70, when he spent twelve months in Vietnam. After recruit training at Puckapunyal there was artillery school at Northlead, Sydney and jungle training in Canungra, Queensland before going to Nui Dat in Vietnam in Number 105 field battery first field regiment. He said that in the time spent there you got to see a lot of different things that weren’t pretty, but you had to wipe it out of your mind as far as possible. You felt it when you came home. The sudden transition from the field to home came with no after-care and it was difficult to be accepted by the society they returned to. He said Anzac Day meant a lot to him. The Burra Dawn Service will be at 6.30 a.m. in Market Square.</p>

<p>Porter’s Lagoon was dry earlier this year. Bill Piggott and Tony Sumner decided to walk across it. They designed special shoes (i.e. some roughly shaped tin plates) to provide stability [having the effect of snow shoes]. Half way out they found fence posts, suggesting that the lagoon had been fenced in half at some time. The trek took about 11⁄2 hours. In 1876 the founder of Spalding, William Lunn and a friend drowned in the lagoon while duck shooting.</p>
<p>In 1926 a syndicate placed a 16 ft clinker-built boat on the lagoon and hired it out for 2/6 an hour or 6d on Sundays and public holidays. In 1927 it was christened The Swan by Mrs Atkins and a single plank jetty was erected. A second boat was called The Gull. A regatta was held for some years around Australia Day with such events as bobbing for corks, four oar swim, tub race, 100 yard swim, slippery pole, riding the barrel and a 440 yard swim. Laurel Neill recalled thousands attending. But the water level fell and by 1937 salt scraped from the surface was being sold. The lake filled again in the 1950s and water skiing became popular. Peter Caddy brought a team from Barmera and the Australian Water Ski Championships* were held on Porter’s Lagoon in the mid 1950s. Water skiing was also popular in the 1970s with Burra families like the Websters, Shipards, Stockmans, Burges, Baums and the Kellys.</p>
<p>Heavy rains in 1993 filled the lake and water even crossed the Barrier Highway in 1994. Laurel recalled it was once believed it was last completely dry in 1914.</p>

<p>Maggie Beer visited Burra last week to research the Cornish pasty. She visited Polly’s Tea Rooms and had lunch there with Maureen Wright. Nicki Bernhardt of Polly’s said the distinguishing feature of a Cornish pasty was the crimped top used as a disposable handle. It was filled with potato, swede, turnip and other vegetables and if meat was available it could be added – usually left over scraps. Maggie and Maureen also visited Morphett’s Enginehouse.

<p>Gaslight has new owners. Bob Perry has moved back to Burra with his wife Jill to run Gaslight Old Books and Collectables. Bob’s family was here in the 1950s when his father was District Clerk. Bob moved to Adelaide 12 or 13 years later to finish school while his parents stayed till the 1970s. Jill and Bob rediscovered Burra about eight years ago, looked around, and bought a cottage. Using the cottage as a weekender, they have seen Gaslight evolve into the popular hive of ‘cuppa society’ it is today. Jill worked for the Commonwealth Department for Employment and Workplace Relations and Bob in training and apprenticeships and was a partner in a printing business before semi-retiring. Jill &amp; Bob said they did not plan to make any major changes to the operation of the business.</p>

<p>Princess Royal Feedlot</p>
<p>Early in 2005 Goyder Council approved a proposal by Simon Rowe for a feedlot on Princess Royal.</p>
<p>Mr Whetstone and Mr Lindner lodged an objection and subsequently appealed to the ERDC.</p>
<p>The ERDC overturned the Council’s approval on the grounds that the feedlot could threaten water resources from pollution or excessive use.</p>
<p>Mr Rowe held that these findings were inconsistent and had no solid foundation or evidence. It focused on the risk the development might have on the water course as a resource. The decision relied, he said, on anecdotal evidence of ground water levels and creek flow and not on evidence from observation wells. The ERDC said the site itself was an appropriate land use and a feedlot would not cause a nuisance by reason of dust, noise and appearance and arrangements for run-off and disposal of waste were satisfactory and were unlikely to pollute ground or surface water.</p>
<p>Mr Whetstone cited the feedlot in Clare, where more than 5,000 cattle resulted in creek pollution and smell. He was not against a feedlot; the issue was its location.</p>
<p>It is understood that prior to an application being lodges, a feedlot was up and running and according to Goyder Council planner, Mr John Brak, it was a case of processing the application as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The latest judgement in the case, in response to Mr Rowe’s second appeal has again rejected the application on the grounds that water use from the Burra Creek is unsustainable.</p>

<p>Country Hospitals are due for change following a recent Government announcement. The new arrangements aim at a three tier system to allow country patients treatment closer to home while improving safety and quality of treatment. Four new general hospitals are to be developed at Pt Lincoln, Whyalla, Berri and Mt Gambier – none of them very close to Mid North Patients. The second level is called Local Integrated Health Services, providing low level acute, primary and residential aged care services. The third level is Small Communities Health Services, providing primary health care and basic emergency care. As yet the impact on Mid North hospitals is unclear, but residents in Burra, Eudunda and Kapunda fear services in their hospitals will be downgraded. Small town hospitals are going to be staffed mainly by nurses and have only aged, minor trauma and overnight observation beds. They are expected to lose surgery facilities, anaesthetics, obstetrics and emergency services. Kapunda Doctor Max van Dissel said he would leave country practice if obstetrics and surgery were stripped from the hospital. Both Kapunda and Eudunda would be without a GP if he were forced to leave.</p>

<p>Burra Creek is infested with Pepper trees and Aleppo pines. Seeds are spreading downstream and causing blockages of the waterway. Pepper trees are commonly planted in homestead gardens and stockyards in dry areas of NSW, Victoria and SA and are spreading in riparian vegetation. Odd trees around homesteads are not a concern, but trees delivering seeds to creeks will see the creeks smothered. Aleppo pines also spread readily and cause concern, as they replace native vegetation.</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>Burra Community Development Program has been granted $10,000 for Burra Ward Capital Project Fund to assist in refurbishment of the Burra Town Hall toilets. The grant will enable a new disabled toilet area to be established and the other toilets to be upgraded. Roy Taplin, a retired painter, has volunteered his time to renovations of the Town Hall and is now turning to the old kitchen behind the stage. ‘Roy is going to save most of it and just modernise it so it can be used again.’ Ms Satchell said.*</p>
<p>Over the years usage of the hall has declined and it is hoped that people will be encouraged to look at the beautiful hall and that new pamphlets will encourage its use for weddings and special occasions. The Town Hall offers excellent kitchen facilities and a large entertainment area. It is open daily, showing a display of historical photographs of Burra.</p>
<p>[*This is nonsense. The old kitchen is off to one side of the stage and there was never any intention to restore it for use. It is a museum display.

Woodgate has the wagon all his life and as his son, I Ashley, knew the wagon well. It was kept in a store [sic: perhaps stone?] walled straw shed except when out working. Many times I helped load the wagon with straw and bagged grain. To cart wheat to Andrews we would put on 80-100 bags and used 8-10 horses to pull it the 121⁄2 miles from our farm at Booborowie. It was an all day trip. Dad took the farm in 1910 and that’s where the wagon was kept.</p>

<p>The Cullens have finally farewelled the Eastern Mail Run after three generations. Grandfather Lance Cullen handed the run to his son Henry and for the last ten years every Friday morning his son Rod and brother Peter have undertaken the run. The lease comes up for renewal every five years and after 47 years the run from 1 July will be taken by Andrew and Penny Shepley. The run starts at the Burra Post Office and then collects items from Burra shops before heading east. It takes from 8 a.m. to about 5 p.m. You have to know where you are going and in wet conditions could easily get lost if unfamiliar with the route. There are two routes and the Cullens went one way one week and the other the following week, so that a person would get deliveries early in the day one week and late the alternate week. Rod and Peter will continue delivery work, running trucks and will wait till the lease again comes up in five years’ time.</p>

<p>Health Bill. The draft Health Care Bill will see country hospital boards disappear, to be replaced by local health advisory councils, a move Country Health SA believes will ensure country community assets are retained locally. Only one hospital board is still standing. [This statement appears to be contradicted in the next paragraph.]</p>
<p>Once country hospital boards are dissolved Health Advisory Councils will be established as incorporated bodies. As well as advising, advocating and fundraising for their local communities HACs will hold the local assets currently managed by incorporated hospitals. A second model creates the Country Health Community Asset Authority (CHCAA), which would be the single asset holding body for all country hospitals, but the HACs would retain their other functions.</p>

<p>Health Care</p>
<p>At the Mid North Health Board meeting on Tuesday Chairperson Ruth Robinson said two issues were currently facing the hospital system:</p>
<p>The new Health Care Plan for four general hospitals across country SA.</p>
<p>The legislation to be introduced in September that will abolish hospital boards.</p>
<p>The minister wants to have one streamlined line of responsibility from nurses to him and the boards are seen as an impediment. Ms Robinson said the board disagreed and thought high standards could be met under the existing structure. If the legislation were passed the boards would remain until 30 June 2008, after which Health Advisory Councils would be formed. Their role would only be advisory. The Board would be seeking further clarification about the role of hospital auxiliaries within the new structure and also on the status of the independent ambulance services at Peterborough, Jamestown and Booleroo.</p>

<p>Andrew Glen writes questioning the manner of reporting in the article ‘Burra Online’ in which it seemed to be implied that this was a new thing. He says Burra has been available online for some time:</p>
<p>Dick Cleland developed a private site some years ago: <a href="https://www.weblogic.com">www.weblogic.com</a></p>
<p>Regional Council of Goyder has <a href="https://www.goyder.sa.gov.au">www.goyder.sa.gov.au</a></p>
<p>Burra Visitor centre four years ago had <a href="https://www.visitburra.com">www.visitburra.com</a></p>
<p>Burra History Group has <a href="https://www.burrahistory.info">www.burrahistory.info</a>, which is a comprehensive guide to the town for history buffs.</p>
<p>The information on these last two sites far exceeds the Burra Burra Heritage site.</p>
<p>[Andrew then goes on at some length to elaborate on www.visitburra.com.]</p>
<p>‘No doubt your reporter took the lead from a certain National Trust Executive member, who has eyes only for the activities of the National Trust Burra Branch, however, that is no excuse for not doing your homework.’</p>
<p>The site itself has more space taken up by disclaimers than by the history of the town. While it asks quite rightly for permission and acknowledgement to be given to the Burra National Trust if a person downloads material for commercial purposes, several pictures on it are taken from the Burra Visitor Centre with no acknowledgement.’</p>

<p>Pigmy Bluetongues</p>
<p>The year 1959 saw the lizards spread as far as Marion and now this critically endangered species has been found at only 22 sites in native grasslands with a population estimated at anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000. The recovery team was founded in 1993 when Pigmy Bluetongues were first rediscovered near Burra. The team lapsed due to lack of funding, but was restarted in 2004. Threatened Fauna Ecologist Julie Schofield said the lizards had some fascinating features:</p>
<p>They eat insects</p>
<p>They are very territorial</p>
<p>Females are longer that males and can carry two babies at a time</p>
<p>The mother cares for the young for some time – unusual for lizards</p>
<p>The recovery team is monitoring several populations to learn more and is attempting to get a certain number of populations under a heritage-conservation agreement, which involves liaising with landowners and making them aware of the lizard’s requirements. BCS has a population on its property. Mapping populations is another aim. Their fragmented population makes them critically endangered.</p>

<p>BCS. Goyder House, the boarding house for school students at Burra, has become increasingly successful. Rooms are booked through to 2013 and 2008 sees rooms filled to a maximum with 14 students already enrolled and five on the waiting list. BCS staff are seeking interested community members to think about taking boarders. The boarding house opened in 1993 to provide a place for children who have to travel long distances for their education. The two storey facility caters for 14 students with nine rooms available. Girls are accommodated upstairs and boys downstairs. Most students come from isolated pastoral areas. A live-in supervisor is responsible for day to day running of the hostel and the care of students. BCS principal Jim Low puts much of the success of the venture down to Michelle Cooper, who has been the supervisor or ‘House mum’ for four years. There are no plans to expand the size of the operation.</p>
<p>Rosemary Ros, Burra History Website designer from Raleigh, NC, USA, writes also expressing concern over the false impression created by the article about Burra’s online presence. She is an Australian living in North Carolina and she says that in July 2004 she began researching her husband’s family history. From the US she found the Burra Visitor Information Centre’s website and a very helpful information office (Rowena Wilson), who put her in touch with Meredith Satchell, who provided a great deal of information and assistance. In thanks Rosemary says she established a website for Meredith’s B &amp; B operation (<a href="https://www.birhccottageburra.com">www.birhccottageburra.com</a>). Some information on Burra was added and by October 2004 the site was attracting interest. In the first year it averaged 2,000 hits per month and in the last four months the figure was 8,500 per month. This led to the establishment of a website for Burra history (<a href="https://www.burrahistory.info">www.burrahistory.info</a>), which was available in January 2005 and moved to its present domain in March 2005. This site has expanded beyond local history to become an avenue for people pursuing their own family history. In January 2006 a section was added to give the Burra Town Hall online visibility. This site now averages over 44,000 hits per month, with an average 50,780 per month in the last four months, compared with over 19,000 per month in 2005.</p>
<p>This might serve to educate on the true history of Burra’s online presence, which had most assuredly commenced long before the introduction of the Burra Burra Heritage website of 19 July 2007.</p>

<p>[*The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time. The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought. (The event returned in 1915.) Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II. The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event. The 2007 show was the 115th.]</p>

<p>The Burra History Group has been collecting information for some years now about the district’s WWI servicemen and nurses. The work began by collecting references to them from the Burra Record. To make this information more useful to family history researchers we have been adding their proper name, date of birth and death where known and their parents’ names. This has not proved to be straightforward. Photographs of those who volunteered have also been sought. Nice collections of photographs exist at the Booborowie and Mt Bryan Halls and when we visited the latter we found serious deterioration due to insect and water damage. We undertook to restore the collection, but to restore the set of 35 photos we need new copies or different photos of Sister A.S.S. Hatherly, G. Prior, M.J. Griffen, A.A. Burton and F.F.W. Richards. We also need to identify two of the soldiers whose images have lost their labels. [Photographs printed.] We, of course, would appreciate photos of any other WWI servicemen and women. Photos are copied and promptly returned.</p>

<p>Tony &amp; Sandra Snook decided to sell the Mobil Roadhouse after five hard working years. The handover to the new owners will be on 14 September. The roadhouse is open from 7.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Prior to the roadhouse being there the site had a mixed history. Prior to 1966 it was two separate blocks.</p>
<p>Block A was owned by James Waters 1875 to 1883.</p>
<p>Block B was owned by James Williams White 1877 to 1906.</p>
<p>The blocks were merged in 1966. From 1966 to 1972 Lionel Hedgland Packer took ownership from Frank Ernest and from 1975 Raymond &amp; Lola Jennison were owners till Tony and Sandra Snook bought the roadhouse from them. Resident Mavis Spackman said some 60 years ago it was a fish and chip shop and before that a gramophone shop and when she was about 10 it became the fish and chip shop.</p>

<p>Waste Management will be a major cost as Goyder Council improves its processes. The closure of landfill sites and extra travel distances for dumping could see rates double. While landfill in low rainfall and isolated areas is very cost effective, the Council has been forced to close all landfill sites and meet the cost of capping them. Waste will have to be transported to a site outside of the region at considerable cost. The Solid Waste Levy will also increase. Expressions of interest from private operators have now been sought. The current annual cost to operate the regional waste collection scheme is in excess of $113,000 and this has meant the Council could minimise its costs to a recovery rate of $80 per household. But with the need for higher capital expenditure of $210,000 in 2007-08 and a similar sum in 2008-09 along with changed management processes, a far greater contribution from ratepayers will be required. Council is supported by Zero Waste and the EPA, but the funds available from Zero Waster to help Councils with infrastructure costs are inadequate. Council thinks more of the Solid Waste Levy should go to Zero Waste for the next 3-5 years than to the EPA.</p>

<p>Steve Boyes writes to complain about the numbers of council jobs around the town that produce star droppers and flagging or plastic cones that then remain for weeks or months. It is time jobs were finished in a more timely manner. The line of star droppers (now, through the passage of time, without flags) from the Kingston Street Bridge to the Bowling Green along the cycle path is a prime example.</p>

<p>Vandals have smashed a window and damaged a donation box at the Redruth Gaol. Damage is estimated at $500. Bill Martin said vandalism was an increasing problem in the area. Not long ago another window was broken at a cost of $100 to repair and the Brewery Cellars gate was pulled off. Hampton’s fence has also been damaged and public toilets near the sites have also been damaged.</p>

<p>Bill Stockman of Burra believes pig producers are being forced out of the business by rising costs. He farms 1,200 pigs, but is struggling with high feed grain prices, pig meat imports, low returns and previous labour shortages. Grain prices have almost doubled recently, but costs cannot be passed on. About 70% of the cost for some piggeries is in feed and any movement in feed prices therefore can greatly add to costs. Since they are now only getting about $2 a kilo for their pigs they are hardly making anything on them. Another problem is his reliance on bore water and its relatively high salinity, which reduces the conception rate in pigs. Salt content of ground water has nearly doubled in the past ten years. The biggest competitors are Holland and Canada which export frozen pig meat. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Men’s Shed took another step closer to reality after a successful meeting in the Bowling Club on Wednesday 29 August with men from Mt Bryan and Booborowie also present. Sixteen men attended. Verna Saunders and John Monten from Lower North Health conducted the meeting and asked those present what they would use the shed for and what equipment they would need. A working group will keep things moving until a lease can be signed off on by the Department of Environment and Heritage. They will seek to source members and equipment, etc.</p>

<p>Numbers are presently down to 14 and Jack Webster is calling for boys aged 6 to 13 to consider joining. Meetings are once a week on Wednesday for just over an hour. The cost is $180, but is well worth the investment as it involves crafts, camping, games, first aid and badge work in which boys acquire a range of skills. It improves a child’s ability to interact with others. Mr Webster said it is also a way to be involved in the community and build self esteem.</p>

He says that acting as Director of the Gallery has been very rewarding, but he is looking forward to moving to Tasmania. He has seen the gallery persevere with presenting art of all sorts, including sculpture, art jewellery, glass sculptures, metal works, etc. He said it all depended on a great group of people. Forty-one volunteers allow it to be open every day except Christmas Day. It is team work that makes it such a success. The hanging team of about six is also very important. There has also been a close association with the Burra Art Group. Mr &amp; Mrs Harvey leave in October to reside in Tasmania on 68 acres, 70% of which is native vegetation. Mr Harvey said the tenth anniversary of the gallery in 2006 had been a highlight. He was made an Honorary Life Member of the Gallery on 30 August. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Evan B. Hawker [sic: for Hawke] writes to express concern over the move to sell the Guide Hall at Burra North.</p>
<p>Because the Regional Art Group has lost a home and its replacement could be outside Burra.</p>
<p>Because the Guides and Brownies have gone to sleep because the leader wanted a rest after 13 years.</p>
<p>Because the head office managers in Adelaide have decided to cash in on the ‘hot’ property market and dispose of the building.</p>
<p>He says he was under the impression that the now defunct Burra Lions Club had donated the building to the local children. (It was previously the Roche Bros Hall and before that the Oddfellows&rsquo; Lodge Hall.)</p>
<p>The Burra Guides and their Hall</p>
<p>The Board of Guides SA has decided to sell the Burra Guides Hall and has informed the local District Leader and Leader in Charge Sharon O’Connor that the decision was made because there were no active Guides in Burra and expenses were ongoing. When guides began 13 years ago* there were 30 or more. Over the years numbers dropped and Sharon said she and Deb Spackman decided to close for 2007 and relaunch in 2008 to get numbers back up. Sharon would like to hear from anyone in the community with ideas on how to reverse the situation and keep the hall open. For the last 13 years the Guides in Burra have been totally self-funding except for an annual insurance bill met by the Board. Burra Guides have funded rates, electricity, water, fire protection etc. [*That is to say in their most recent incarnation. Guides operated in Burra from 1937 to 1943 and were reformed in 1947 and are mentioned in the paper until at least 1953.]</p>

<p>Casey Cooper &amp; Melissa Miller returned earlier this month from 12 months in Canada. The pair worked on a small cattle ranch. They spent the first two months working at a gas plant in Edson before moving to Calgary, Alberta, where they lived in a log cabin on a ranch and used horses to round up cows. They had to deal with pulling calves and bedding expectant cows in a barn while the outside temperature was -45°. They managed to combine their work with visits to the Rockies and other parts of British Columbia. They have returned expecting a baby and Casey has started work again at Clare Crane Hire.

And they were accidentally carried on the Broken Hill and had to be sent back to Peterborough for the sale. The steel yards and loading ramps have recently been sold by tender.</p>

The audience was most appreciative and combined to raise $600 for them. The event also made more than $4,000 profit, which will be divided among Burra charities. The club had booked out Paxton Square and other accommodation. The club was formed in 1983 for people over 50 with a common interest in motorcycles.</p>

<p>Burra Girl Guides have a doubtful future with the possible closure of the Guide Hall in Burra. Guide Leader Sharon O’Connor said she has yet to hear any news from the Board of Guides SA about such a decision. What news she has had seems contradictory. The Board has said its decision to close the hall was based on the cost the Board incurs for maintenance, but in fact maintenance finance has come from local fundraising. Mrs O’Connor would like to know if anyone is interested in saving the hall because if no one cares she won’t bother fighting for it. Burra Girl Guides went into recess for a year due to low numbers, but if the hall is closed Mrs O’Connor says she will not resume in 2008. After 14 years as District Leader she needed a break. If any parents would like their children to participate in Girl Guides they should contact Sharon O’Connor. [Photo.]</p>

The locum tenens during that period was Fr Roy Todd of Watervale. The Hilliers spent eleven years in Whyalla and have just had some months of long service leave. They will live at the Rectory. Fr Michael will work in the parish on a half time basis, combining that with developing a new diocesan Ministry in Spirituality. Fr Michael’s first official service will be on 4 November at 10 a.m. when the choir of Brougham Place Uniting Church will lead the singing and at 2 p.m. they will present a concert of musical items to suit all tastes. Their conductor and leader is Rosemary Nairn OAM (sister of Robert Reed of Burra).</p>

<p>Barbara Wallis &amp; Burra’s Ghosts</p>
<p>Ms Wallis believes at least 30% of Burra’s houses are haunted. She cites:</p>
<p>A wailing ghost at the Bon Accord Cottage.</p>
<p>Noises and dodgy electrical circuits in the room above the Kooringa Hotel Bar.</p>
<p>The ghost of a nun in the Kooringa Hotel, ‘who was possibly here when the hotel was a boys’ school’.*</p>
<p>Visitors report ghostly encounters in Paxton Square Cottages.</p>
<p>A little girl died in a well c. 1850 and still spends time on the bike track.</p>
<p>Ms Wallis conducts historical tours of the Burra Cemetery – but not ghost tours.</p>
<p>[*The nun’s ghost would be somewhat unexpected here, since the former Grammar School on the site was not a Catholic institution and was conducted in a building that was demolished before the hotel was built.]</p>

<p>Goyder’s Line. Research by CSIRO &amp; SARDI says that modelling suggests that with global climatic change, by 2030 Goyder’s Line could move 20 km south and by 2070 some 50 km south. While the warming trend can be projected with some confidence, the effect on rainfall is far less certain and technological developments may make the effects of climate change less damaging.</p>

<p>Letter. Julian Ratcliffe responds to the article on Burra’s ghosts. He takes issue with heading such stories as history – ‘rich stories’ they may be, but not history. Halloween is an American phenomenon that we could well do without.</p>
<p>‘How can one possibly estimate the percentage of haunted houses in Burra? Well I can. My estimate is far more accurate, scientific, reliable and credible. None.’</p>
<p>He then tells the history of the Kooringa Hotel site.</p>
<p>The early building on the site was a Congregational Church and later a Welsh Chapel. It became a Church of England Grammar School in 1864 – conducted on principles similar to the Collegiate College of St Peter in Adelaide. It closed in 1873. It was demolished in 1884 and the stone stored at the Unicorn Brewery, whose owners then built the Kooringa Hotel on the site. In 1912 the stone was used in the new residence for the Primary School Headmaster.</p>
<p>‘The Kooringa Hotel [is] a grand hotel that doesn’t need a ghost to promote it.’</p>

<p>Public Forum on Paxton Square at Burra Town Hall last Thursday.</p>
<p>The hall was packed with concerned locals in a meeting that lasted almost three hours. Nemerous people directed questions and voiced concerns to the panel made up of Mayor Peter Mattey, CEO Steve Kerrigan and Finance Manager, Bill Mader.</p>
<p>There was great concern over the future of the square and demands for clarification of Council’s ‘Futures Report’. The cottages are currently leased to Maswood Pty Ltd and this lease expires on 31 August 2008. Council’s figures show that maintenance costs have outstripped income and the cottages are in desperate need of renovation. The Council is considering:</p>
<p>A management arrangement.</p>
<p>A long term lease.</p>
<p>Complete sale of the Heritage Listed site.</p>
<p>The Council wished to get an idea of what should happen from a community point of view. Would the community for instance be prepared to pay a levy on Council rates to assist in the renovation? The upgrade was expected to cost at least $800,000 over five years.</p>
<p>Several of the speakers expressed disapproval of the Council’s maintenance of the cottages. Helen Stockman said that many grants had been received to assist the cottages, which are important to Burra. Paul Wilson put forward a motion that was carried, to form a committee to investigate the operation and running of the cottages. Salt damp is a major maintenance problem. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Wind Farm. The recently announced wind farm at Hallett Hill will create c. 150 new jobs during the construction phase. 34 turbines will generate 71 megawatts.</p>
<p>[The figure 34 does not accord with the 71 mentioned in the announcement in the previous issue. There seems to be a confusion between turbines and megawatts. The following extract from Wikipedia clarifies the position:</p>
<p>‘Hallett Hill Wind Farm, also known as Hallett 2 Wind Farm, was completed in late 2009. It consists of 34 Suzlon turbines each 2.1 MW, giving and installed capacity of 71.4 MW. Up to March 2011 it was averaging a capacity factor of 39%.’]</p>

<p>Letter. Paul Wilson comments on the recent Paxton Square meeting:</p>
<p>He had the impression that Council had made a decision and did not put forward some realistic options.</p>
<p>A true assessment of the potential of business cannot be made on the figures supplied by Council.</p>
<p>Maswood Pty Ltd are the only people who would know the true operation of the cottages at this time.</p>
<p>Several ideas have since come forward:</p>
<p>Include the caravan park book [sic: for booking office?] in the centre.</p>
<p>Move the Tourist Information Centre to the building.</p>
<p>Lease out the area in blocks.</p>
<p>Baker [sic: presumably for Barker] Homes might take over a row.</p>
<p>Council could use it for expansion – e.g. Planing [sic: Planning Office?]</p>
<p>Make Paxton Square a community owned business.</p>

<p>Skate Park. Ashley Williams (Year 11 BCS) has produced a short film with cinematographer Bud Norris, titled Skateboarding, as part of the ‘Eat My Shorts’ film festival, in which youth from five schools across the Mid North were involved in creating films screened on 8 November. Skateboarding was judged Film of the Festival. Ashley (17) is a motocross enthusiast, but sees skateboarding as an issue that needs to be addressed and he hopes the Goyder Council will take note of the message. With no skate park, Burra youth are taking their skateboards and their tricks to the street, which is dangerous. Lower North Youth Health worker, Danielle Bradford supports the idea of a skate park and Heidi Thompson from the Goyder Council is also interested in the idea.</p>

<p>A grant of $1,500 has enabled Roy Taplin to restore the old kitchen [1920s] at the Town Hall, to give visitors a glimpse of history. The kitchen has been set up to reflect its appearance when in use. Roy has also constructed a wall with a viewing window [showing the rock wall across the back of the Town Hall]. New lighting has been installed. Heritage Advisor, Douglas Alexander applauded the work done and especially Roy’s input, when he signed off on the renovations and handed over the grant.

Could the labour component of a successful tenderer be met with a cash rebate from rates? [Further details of her idea are printed.]</p>
<p>Letter. Helen Edwards of Burra comments that rates in Burra are twice as much as those in Jamestown and as expensive as those in Adelaide, without the amenities of the city. She also queries the situation of Paxton Square Cottages, when it seems 80% of the revenue was spent on salaries and wages, leaving little for maintenance.</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>‘Burra is holding its celebration of 150 years of the site of the Town Hall this Saturday evening from 8 p.m. until 11.30 p.m.’ Sister Jean Johnson, conductor, is bringing the Peterborough Choir, a branch of Sing Australia, to Burra for the occasion.</p>
<p>[Further details about the choir are included and a photo of Sister Jean Johnson.</p>
<p>The 150 years of the site is a somewhat obscure way of saying what was being remembered. In 1857 the original Burra Burra Miners’ &amp; Mechanics’ Institute was built on the site. This was greatly enlarged in 1874 to create the general appearance of the building that is now the Burra Town Hall. As far as can be determined, it would seem that the original building survives in at least part of the walls of the present foyer.]</p>

<p>Phoenix Copper announced a public float last Thursday, aiming to raise $10 million to see SA’s copper heritage burgeon again. The boom in copper prices has initiated renewed interest in exploration. The company will seek copper-gold deposits and says the present prices would give the opportunity to mine otherwise sub-marginal deposits profitably. The company will use advanced techniques in geology and geophysics. The former ‘Monster Mine’ is one of their prime targets, given that the possible sulphide source of the ‘Monster Mine’ has never been discovered. Goyder Council’s acting CEO, Bill Mader anticipates proposed plans might be quite interesting for the town. The company will also be interested in areas around Spalding, Mongolata and Minlaton.</p>

<p>Clare Valley Aerodrome</p>
<p>Farrell Flat Management Committee is making a final attempt to raise interest and support for an aerodrome in the Clare Valley. A meeting will be held at Farrell Flat on 13 December. The idea is to cater for aircraft up to 5,700 kg. This will be a final attempt after six years. Last year the Clare &amp; Gilbert Valley Council withdrew their support ‘for more pressing schemes’. A major problem is finding the land – a flat site at Hanson has been identified, but the owner is reluctant to sell. Funding is the other obvious hurdle.</p>

<p>Girl Guides Hall</p>
<p>The Girl Guides Hall was advertised for sale by auction on 28 November 2007, but was sold two weeks earlier to an unknown buyer. Burra District Guides Leader, Sharyn O’Connor said this marked the end of Guides in Burra; there were no more options. Girl Guides SA see it differently. Business Manager Tanya Sexton said every effort was made to revitalise the Burra Group before deciding to sell the hall. The hall was in a dilapidated state and a large amount of money would have had to be spent on it to rectify the problems. She said Guides still could be re-opened in Burra. A similar thing happened to the Scouts, but they continued. Mrs O’Connor said that she had looked forward to resuming local Guides in 2008, but with the sale of the hall, they would not be re-instated in Burra. [Photo.]</p>

<p>BCS students saw a demonstration of shearing by the Bioclip method on Friday, by Farrell Flat farming and livestock contractor, Adrian Cook. This method sees the injection of a naturally occurring protein between the hind legs, which encourages a break in the wool follicles. The sheep are covered with a body-hugging nylon net to contain the wool. After 28 days the net is pulled off, along with the fleece, to reveal a perfectly shorn sheep. The lambs are a lot less stressed and no special treatment is needed afterwards. The method is both cost and labour efficient. If grower and buyer have settled on clip parameters and price, the wool can be baled while still in the nets and sent to the processor.

<p>Burra Ambulance Volunteers Tony Eldredge &amp; Annette Spackman have been selected to pursue paramedic careers in regional areas. They will work full-time at a new station while completing the paramedic degree. Mr Eldredge will move to Waikerie and Mrs Spackman to Whyalla for the five year program. The program is an initiative aimed at rural people because it has always proved difficult to get qualified university graduates to move to the country.</p>
<p>The move means there is a call for more volunteers now in Burra. Rosemary Opperman recently received a long service medal after volunteering for the ambulance for almost 27 years.</p>

<p>Proposed Caroona Creek Conservation Park</p>
<p>A biological survey of the area by the Department for the Environment &amp; Heritage and the SA Museum and local volunteers in late October revealed three previously unrecorded lizard species and Bolam’s Mouse, a native, but sparsely distributed species – listed as endangered in NSW and presumed extinct in Victoria.</p>
<p>Lizard species were:</p>
<p>The Pink Blotched Gecko</p>
<p>Broad-banded Sandswimmer</p>
<p>Western Bluetongue</p>
<p>The park lies c. 50 km north of Burra on the western edge of the Olary Plain and contains the Tooralie Gorge. The discovery of the lizards is a range extension for their species.</p>

<p>Burra Citizen of the Year is Meredith Satchell.</p>
<p>Since returning to her home town seven years ago, Meredith Satchell has worked tirelessly to promote the town by uncovering the pieces of its history. She is part of The Burra History Group and one of the Burra Town Hall Committee. Many people have ancestors who spent time in Burra and much of her work is concerned with helping those researching their family history. The History Group has established a display of historic photographs in the Town Hall and keeping it open every day acts as great publicity both for the town and the hall as a community facility available for hire. Ms Satchell’s paternal great-grandfather settled in the farming district here in the 1870s. Ms Satchell said the honour of Burra Citizen of the Year was very humbling given the number of people who volunteer their time in so many ways and she saw it more as a way of promoting Burra’s history. She will continue to help people researching their families and also will continue to add to the town’s collection of historic photographs. [Photo]</p>
<p>Burra Young Citizen of the Year is Chelsea Evans.</p>
<p>Chelsea gained the award in recognition of her involvement with the Burra Community School and the Auburn Players. She was also a state finalist in the Rostrum Voice of Youth Public Speaking Competition 2005. She came to live in Burra at the start of her teenage years. Having recently completed Year 12, she intends to work in Adelaide for a year before going to performing arts school. She recommends that young people get involved in the local community, not just because it looks good on their résumé, but because it broadens experience and allows you to see more of what is around.</p>

<p>BCS students have organised a petition to the Goyder Council to open the Burra Pool in the holidays regardless of the weather. Michael Fretwell of the Goyder Council admits the arrangements can be a bit confusing. The pool is open in the day when the forecast temperature for Clare is 28°C or more and at night when the figure is 32°C or more. The boys concerned think it is always hotter in Burra than in Clare. The Council in December decided to be guided by the Burra Swimming Pool Management Committee, which so far has not met on the matter. The pool costs $40 to $40 an hour to run, so getting people through the gate is necessary.</p>

The club began in the early 1980s as a social club for people with an interest in motorcycles and they try to donate money to charities and local organisations as often as possible. The club annually donates about $100,000 to their own Ulysses Club Arthritis Research Fund and they voted on which Burra groups should benefit.</p>

<p>Paxton Square</p>
<p>The committee considering the square’s future is making slow progress following the public meeting in November, which attracted much interest. The plans for the future of the cottages have been evoked by the expiration of the Heritage Facility Agreement held by Maswood Pty Ltd, which occurs on 31 August 2008. Council says the income raised is continually in deficit of the costs of desperately needed renovations and upkeep. The Mayor says occupancy rates are sliding and revenues are not increasing. The committee reports that it needs access to current accurate information on operating costs, but privacy of the business dealing of the current managers’ operations makes this impossible.</p>
<p>The Council rent is minimal, but would require around 10% minimal occupancy.</p>
<p>Several possibilities are being considered, including a long term lease.</p>
<p>The committee has raised several concerns regarding the need for accurate information, especially the need to gain access to actual operating costs of maintaining the cottages. But the manager of properties and facilities Mike Fretwell suggested an educated guess would have to suffice as access to all costs were part of the private business dealings of the current manager’s operations.</p>
<p>Another option was to let four or five of the cottages on a permanent basis to the Burra based diving school as regular accommodation for their students. Occupancy of the cottages has been minimal even in months deemed popular by tourists.</p>
<p>The committee has been granted an extension of time to the end of April to make its recommendations. The delay has been due to the need to examine the primarily confidential Heritage Facility Agreement. This was undertaken last Thursday. They will next meet on 19 February and may then need to meet fortnightly to meet the deadline.</p>

The current copper and gold prices are attractive for mining operations and Phoenix Copper considers its tenement holdings contain a number of promising targets.</p>

<p>Burra Creek catchment waters have been monitored over the last 18 months to identify salinity levels. The project relies on local volunteers and began in July 2006 with three volunteers, but has expanded to include four other groups, who collect samples on a quarterly basis. Tests monitor salinity, temperature, pH levels, nitrates, phosphorates and turbidity. Early trends suggest that surface water salinity is three to seven times that considered suitable for human consumption and pH levels are slightly alkaline, but still healthy for a fresh water system.</p>

<p>Burra’s Heritage Sites on the Passport Trail are suffering from a lack of maintenance following the end of a contract between the Council and the National Trust some 18 months ago. Maintenance of Council owned sites is below expectations according to Council Acting CEO Bill Mader. Negotiations between the National Trust and the Council have been drawn out and the Trust has refused to disclose site work and expenditure on all sites since the contract is no longer valid. The National Trust in about October 2006 reduced the commission given to the Burra Visitor Centre for the sale of the Passport from 30% to 17.5% because the Trust was incurring increased costs of maintenance. Following the last Council meeting the Council’s share of the Passport income will now go directly to the Council, which will maintain its own sites. The future of the Passport remains under discussion.</p>

The project team led by Mr Stuart Heseltine has been in Burra canvassing residents. The report will consider the creek’s future and its quality and ability to retain water in a suitable way. The Council is concerned to gauge reactions to a decrease in the amount of water retained in the creek. The Asset Manager said the present level is costing a fortune to maintain and it is not sustainable. There have been a number of suggestions to enhance the creek area including the provision of an amphitheatre and a bike trail. The plans would have enhancement of the area’s appeal for tourists as a major focus.</p>

<p>BCS. The Mexican Fiesta &amp; Continental was a great success. About 650 people attended last Friday at the oval. What was gratifying was the number of people present who were not related to the school.</p>
<p>Adrian Gill responds to Terry Bull’s letter of 27 February about the National Trust meeting. He denies that his late arrival showed contempt for the meeting and was due to work commitments. He also feels that the National Trust’s decision to launch a ‘rejuvenated’ Passport on 1 April flies in the face of the overwhelming majority of speakers at the meeting.</p>
<p>Jailhouse Rock at the Town Hall was a success and it seems that this will be enough to ensure the continuation of the event. The Town Hall is a more economical venue than the old Gaol and makes it easier to turn a profit.</p>

<p>The SA Museum will run tours to the normally inaccessible palaeontology sites at Redbanks Conservation Park during Palaeontology Week. Fossilised remains were first discovered there in the early 1900s*, but in 2000 an almost complete skeleton was discovered as well as remains of a Thylacine and of a Thylacoleo (a marsupial lion). The discoveries near Burra are important because they are fairly close to the surface and more intact than elsewhere. Fossil Tourism is growing in Australia. [Article of 1⁄3 page.]</p>
<p>[*This is incorrect. The first discoveries were near the town in 1868. There was a further discovery at Bundey in 1889 and a major one at Redbanks in 1890.]</p>

<p>RAAF’s Hot Air Balloon visited Burra last Thursday. There was a balloon demonstration at BCS on 6 March. It is all part of the RAAF’s program to make people aware of the possibility of jobs in the service and it is an economical ad effective promotional device according to Squadron Leader Bob Cook. Wind conditions prevented any attempt to fully inflate the balloon, though the burners were demonstrated to students. The group visited Clare on Friday and Saturday.

<p>Burra Railway Station</p>
<p>The future of this heritage building is critical as lack of funding is threatening planned restoration. In 2006 the Burra Regional Art Gallery secured a lease on the building in the hopes of transforming it into a mega-fauna inspired Palaeontology Museum, but at present without funding this is not feasible. A structural assessment of the building is needed, because although the stonework is sound, the woodwork is not. The Director of the SA Museum is supportive. The station was erected in 1883 to replace a wooden structure of 1870. Rail services were discontinued in 1985 and the line was closed in 1988 and the station has since deteriorated. Its situation has now become critical.</p>
<p>[Note that the above dates for the end of services are incorrect. Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986. The last grain trains ran for the 1998-99 harvest in January 1999. The last passenger train was an ARHS special steam train on 19 September 1992. The line does not seem to have been officially closed. ARG ran the last movement on the line when it sent a light engine to Burra 12 March 2004. The line beyond Burra was taken up 1992-93.]</p>

If Burra were to close the next service would have to come from Clare, Kapunda or Eudunda and if they were busy the next ambulance is at Gawler. The time for attendance would increase from 10-15 minutes to at least 40 minutes. A meeting for those interested is called for Monday 7 April at Burra Ambulance Station.</p>

<p>Burra National Trust held another general meeting on Tuesday night at the Burra Town Hall. Over 50 (mainly members) attended. Chris Reed was elected chairman for the night. He explained that a meeting had been called due to the reluctance of the Burra Branch Committee to convene a general meeting. The purpose was to discuss National Trust Burra affairs and the Passport. He insisted the meeting be conducted in an open and transparent manner and that the outcome should indicate a clear path forward.</p>
<p>He reviewed the meeting of 21 February at the Court House, which had an unsatisfactory outcome. He established that the committee had not taken notice of the concerns of the rank and file members and long term residents concerning the proposed changes to the Burra Passport made by the committee. The Regional Council of Goyder has received a draft Memorandum of Understanding from National Trust SA to promote and develop the Burra Passport in its present form. The Council is ready to sign, pending the outcome of this meeting.</p>
<p>National Trust SA Council Members also attended and they took minutes and recommendations back to the SA National Trust Council meeting held last Thursday.</p>
<p>That meeting passed the following recommendations:</p>
<p>Maintenance reports in respect of Goyder Council properties leased to the National Trust be provided to the State Office by the Burra Branch and then forwarded to Goyder Council.</p>
<p>Glenys Carse, Chairman of the Regions’ &amp; Branches’ Committee become a member of the Burra Branch sub-committee and a member of the Burra Branch who is not a member of the Burra Branch Committee join the sub-committee, having been chosen by votes of branch members.</p>
<p>Burra Branch Sub-Committee report to National Trust SA Council by 17 May 2008 on recommendations for contractual arrangements for the Burra Passport.</p>
<p>Arrangements based on the most recent leases and sales agency agreements remain in place until new arrangements are endorsed, except that the National Trust be released from maintenance obligations for Council owned sites for the period for which the Goyder Council has retained its share of the Passport income.</p>
<p>Chris Reed has recommended that a further general meeting be called as soon as possible to elect a member to the sub-committee.</p>

(80 other young men of Burra district lost their lives on service during WWI.)</p>

<p>Anzac Day prompted a short article by Michelle Osborn on the Burra Cheer-up Society and on Pte George Albert Williams. The Cheer-up Society was made up principally of young women who provided farewell socials for departing volunteers and rousing patriotic welcomes on their return. It also raised money to aid soldiers and for the Adelaide Cheer-up Hut as well as providing woollen comforts, Christmas boxes etc. for the troops. When the town’s Coronation Band ceased to function due to its members largely volunteering for war service, the women formed the Cheer-up Ladies’ Band to provide patriotic music in Burra and elsewhere in SA for fund-raising events and at the station to welcome returning men.</p>
<p>George Albert Williams was born at Ironmine 18 March 1891 and departed for the front after a farewell at Leighton 22 November 1916. He was seriously wounded on 17 October 1917 and died 20 November 1917. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Pygmy Bluetongue lizards feature in a documentary to be shown on Channel 9 on 28 April. It was made by Sir David Attenborough as an episode Dragons of the Dry in the series Life in Cold Blood. Sir David visited Burra in 2006. Life in Cold Blood is the first documentary to show footage of the pigmy bluetongue lizards in their burrows, including mothers and their young. The level of parental care shown by them is unusual in reptiles. The lizard is a small brown skink about 10 cm long and was thought to be extinct for decades until one was discovered in the stomach of a brown snake in 1992. A search subsequently found several small colonies across the Mid North and so far 24 colonies have been found from Auburn to Peterborough. Each of the known colonies is on private property so co-operation and goodwill of landowners is vital. [Two photos.]</p>
<p>Barry Eberhard’s clearing sale recently marked the end of an era as he sold his last property within the Burra area. The family has owned property in the Burra area since Murray Eberhard (Barry’s father) bought over 4,000 acres of Mullaby in 1954. Over the years Barry and his brother also acquired properties at World’s End – ‘Baldina Downs’. Most of Mullaby was sold a couple of years ago to T. &amp; R. Pastoral Co., leaving just 166 acres on Wandillah Road, which was home to Barry’s mother for many years. Barry &amp; Judy have retired to Burra, but their son Simon has a sheep and cattle property near Angaston.</p>

<p>Obituary. Jessie May Rooke 30 September 1906 to 8 April 2008</p>
<p>‘Jessie May Rooke was born on September 30, 1906 to Elizabeth and Samuel Finch of World&rsquo;s End. She grew up on the land and attended World&rsquo;s End School and Methodist Church. She left school finishing her Primary education and gaining her QC at 14. She worked on her parents&rsquo; property and her life on the land was Jessie&rsquo;s greatest love, riding her horse (often bareback) over the hills mustering sheep, fencing etc. As long as Jessie was outdoors she was happy. She played tennis, joined the district&rsquo;s social activities; there were many social gatherings at the Burra Creek. Jessie also loved dancing and would ride her horse to a friend&rsquo;s place, get in the dray and go to dances in the district. On her return she would mount her horse and head for home. In November of 1932 Jessie married Edmund Rooke in the Kooringa Methodist Church, Burra and honeymooned at Broken Hill. On their return they settled on a property at Baldina east of Burra. There she worked with her husband milking cows, farming and sheep work. Ted died in 1962 and Jessie continued to live and work on her property with help when she needed it. She was a very hard working determined woman, who would not let anything or anyone beat her. Jessie&rsquo;s parents, Sam and Liz Finch returned to Burra. With failing health, Jessie brought her parents to her home and cared for them. Liz died in June 1961 aged 82. With the help of friends, she cared for her father until he was hospitalised. He died in 1963 aged 90. With help Jessie continued working hard, loading bales of hay on her ute, feeding her sheep, checking her dams, windmills and fences almost daily. Driving her ute around her paddocks was her great love. Jessie would skin and cut up kangaroos to feed her dogs and cats, make a dog cake every week and feed her cats bread and milk. She was always there to help out her neighbours. The kettle was always on the boil and a meal on the table for all who called. Jessie Rooke was a true, hard-working, honest and trusting woman of the land she loved so passionately.’</p>

<p>Jazz in the Monster Mine is one of the Mid North’s most popular events. It had its origins in 1997 when John &amp; Suzy Tilley offered the use of ‘Petherton’ to raise funds for the restoration of Sir Hubert Wilkins&rsquo; homestead. Over the next five years the natural amphitheatre of the old orchard at ‘Petherton’ was the setting for ever growing audiences. The profits exceeded $20,000. When the restoration was completed the venue moved to the open cut at the Burra Mine with the permission of the National Trust who lease the site, the Goyder Council sho own it and Adchem who own the access to the Mine Pool. It has since been a bi-annual event, but organisers now feel that with 50% of patrons being first time visitors, it could become annual. Profits could go towards reconstruction of the buddle pits near the resited Peacock’s Chimney. Another possible project would be the rebuilding of the boiler house adjacent to Morphett’s Engine House, as an interpretive centre. AGL are keen to commit to sponsorship and the event is planned to run again next February.</p>
<p>Phoenix Copper hosted a dinner and presentation at the Burra Hotel last week to update residents of the company’s plans. Most of the thirty locals invited were landholders, Councillors and business people. Managing Director Paul Dowd gave a brief overview before handing over to Chief Geologist Mark Manly to explain the geological work to begin within a few weeks. He explained that by using the Niton handheld XRF analyser the footprint on the land will be minimal. While the main focus will be on the Burra district, operations will also be carried out at Spalding, Mongolata and Minlaton. Even if all went well it could be several years before any unearthing and processing of copper or gold would be seen.</p>

<p>Koomooloo Life</p>
<p>Michelle Osborn writes an article on the life of Henry &amp; Jacqui Dunn at Koomooloo, 75 km east of Burra, with three young children: Jock (4), Posie (3) and Hugo (13 months). [Two photos.]</p>
<p>The family moved there three years ago. They get into Burra once a week or once a fortnight. Jock and Posie make use of Kindy of the Air (via computer), which is accessed through RICE (Remote Isolated Children’s Exercise) Pt Augusta and they attend Burra Pre-School Kindergarten when possible.</p>
<p>The recent employment of governess Ashlea Kuzmich from Redcliffe Station has made life easier. Outback childcare also provides a childcare worker to come to stay for a minimum of two weeks at a time, which is particularly handy at busy times like crutching and shearing. There is also a toy Library service. There are neighbours with young children. Both Jacqui and Henry sat Koomooloo is a wonderful environment for children. The problems of medical care, however, were made apparent when Posie last Tuesday fell off the back of a ute and needed urgent medical attention. The Burra ambulance arrived half an hour before the helicopter rescue team. Posie was flown to Adelaide and has fully recovered from the concussion she sustained. Henry was amazed at the quick response of the Burra ambulance.</p>

<p>The Closing of Country Hospitals</p>
<p>Can the report in the Northern Argus of 7 May 2008 possibly be true? Are 25 country hospitals to be axed? If so, who is the faceless architect of this scheme? A properly informed rethink of this plan is urgently needed before it is set in concrete. The country hospital is a vital part of the fabric of a town. They have been so through good years and bad. In an outbreak of disease or an epidemic the local level is best at handling it. The presence of a hospital does much to influence decisions to relocate to a country town. The city hospital system is overloaded, so why increase pressure on it by bringing in country people who could be treated locally? Why destroy a system that works? The proposal would increase reliance on the very expensive helicopter retrieval service. The Burra Hospital is on the list of proposed closures. It serves a town with an enormous amount of heavy traffic passing through and accidents are not unusual. There is an increase in wind farm activity and mining, with attendant possible accidents. It lies west of a vast area of sparsely populated pastoral land where people are exposed to hazardous situations and have often been saved by the presence of a local hospital. The Government wastes its money on dumb non-essential staff. Essentials must come first and country hospitals are essential. They and their allied services must be retained.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>Shadow Minister for Health, Vicki Chapman, says she has been informed that the Rann Labor Government wants to close 25 country hospitals following the abolition of Country Hospital Boards, effective 10 April 2008. The plan would convert the closed hospitals to aged care facilities and see the development of four regional hospitals at Mt Gambier, Berri, Whyalla and Pt Lincoln. Local residents are concerned at this threatened loss. So far no one from the Government has responded to enquiries from the Mid North Broadcaster on this situation. Health care in the country is already a concern with many obstetrician services closed and any plans to close acute and emergency care services must be made public said Ms Chapman.</p>
<p>Such closures would also increase the burden on city hospitals that are already overloaded. It would also impose huge transport and accommodation costs to travel to the city or major regional centres. The RFDS is also stretched to the limit and volunteer ambulance drivers are no longer available in some regions.</p>

<p>Redbanks. Recent discoveries have confirmed earlier hints that marsupial lions roamed the area in the last ice age. Small fossil remnants had suggested this about six years ago. Now a pelvis and arm bone of the Thylacoleo have been found near Diprotodon fossils. It is believed to have been about the size of a large wolf or leopard and was Australia’s largest marsupial predator. Thylacoleo carnifex had huge meat-slicing cheek teeth and retractable clawed opposable thumbs. The Redbanks site is important as finds are near the surface and more intact than at other sites.</p>
<p>Department of Environment &amp; Heritage District Ranger Ian Falkenberg said it was hoped to establish commercial tourism at the site with properly trained community members involved in guiding and tourism. Accredited training would have to be undertaken. It is also hoped to improve the current fossil display in the Council Foyer and to find a large home for it.</p>

The first branch manager, Mr R.G. Prole was paid a huge £300 p.a. The bank was founded in Victoria and SA was the first of the other colonies for expansion. Burra’s branch was established before the bank had offices in Sydney, Melbourne or Perth.</p>

<p>ROB Fest was held on Saturday 12 April in Balaklava. Approximately 450 people attended and 13 young bands competed with three headline and supporting acts. The profit is still being collated, but is likely to be just over $3,000, which will go towards to running costs of Rob Fest 09.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>Mining Companies Phoenix Copper and Ellemby Resources have written to the Health Minister John Hill expressing their concern at the Burra Hospital to a GP Plus.</p>
<p>Ellemby is currently doing feasibility studies on the Mongolata Goldfield involving millions of dollars in drilling and trial mining. It is reasonably confident of starting a gold mine that would employ 30-50. Phoenix intends to have an ongoing economic presence in the area. Archer Exploration Ltd is also interested in the region with an exploration licence at the Fairview phosphate mine and the Robertstown Copper Mine. Both Ellemby and Phoenix regard a local hospital offering acute and emergency care as important and possibly the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>Paul J. Dowd, Managing Director of Phoenix Copper Ltd writes with a copy of the letter sent to the State health Minister, and develops the points in the page 1 article.</p>
<p>Barry Wright writes commending the initiative of the girls who have constructed makeshift hurdles in the creek area and who have been jumping their horses there, but condemning the mindless perpetrators of graffiti on the road by Peacock’s Chimney and of malicious damage to posts along the main road.</p>

<p>Shane O’Bryan of Burra has been involved in the shearing industry for more than 30 years, having started as a young teenager. He made a career of shearing sheep by travelling all over the state, but said the season had now dropped to eight months from eleven. Expenses in living away from home range from $20 to $35 a day so no one is keen to work away in contract sheds. Fewer young people are taking up the job. Roustabouts are even harder to find. It is hard physical work and not well paid. There is no holiday or sick pay or a guaranteed weekly income. The money is very appealing for young workers, but when they get older they can earn better wages. To keep men on the job you need to find them jobs when work is short. Mr O’ Bryan started at 16 and became a gun shearer, going from 40 wethers a day to 200 or more. His best was 333.</p>
<p>The Arrival of the Talbot Car in July has prompted the Burra History Group to gather some information on the journey and those involved. Mr Aunger (1878-1953) has a Burra connection. As early as June 1900 he visited Burra and won a 2 mile cycle race and by 1907 he was famous as a champion cyclist. In 1910 Murray Aunger Ltd of Adelaide established a branch garage in Burra that operated until he left the company in 1917. In this period (c. 1913) he built the body of a Newton Bennett car for Dr J.I. Sangster [Jnr] of Burra. The doctor died soon after taking delivery of it and Mr C.B. Warnes purchased it and used it for pulling scrub at Woolgangi. Les Warnes and his brother Charley are nephews of C.B. Warnes and recall using the vehicle for rabbit shooting expeditions. The car passed to Les in 1936 when he was 14. It was then used as a farm working vehicle, though in 1940 he drove it to Adelaide for a veteran car rally. The car was restored by Ian Tilbrook of Adelaide in 1970. The foot brake operates on the tail shaft, which means braking is minimal.</p>

<p>Adelaide to Darwin in 1924</p>
<p>Photographs of Essington Lewis on a journey to Darwin by car in 1924 have emerged recently from the Booborowie rubbish dump. The photos and some other documents were handed to Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group. Meredith then set about finding out what she could of the journey. Essington Lewis had two directors of BHP as companions; Harold Darling and Walter Duncan and a friend Robert Meares, who was later a director. Even though the journey had been done before, it was still rare to see cars in Central Australia and supplies of petrol had to be sent on ahead. For the journey two six cylinder Dort cars were prepared and modified to cope with rough roads and sandy patches. The Burra History Group has organised a display in the Burra Town Hall of the photographs of the cars along with pictures of some of the homesteads on the route and of the terrain.</p>

<p>Mayor Peter Mattey has written to the Health Minister John Hill highlighting residents’ concerns over the downgrading of the Eudunda and Burra Hospitals to GP Plus Emergency facilities. The letter points out the additional costs to patients and families should they need to travel to a Hub Hospital at Clare or Pt Pirie, the social cost, the additional time it will take to get medical aid and the additional burden placed on Eudunda and Burra Ambulance services. The letter says it seems inevitable that Burra and Eudunda Hospitals will lose their ability to offer hospital based acute care. The threat to the towns’ ability to attract and retain GPs was also listed.</p>

<p>The Burra Cemetery</p>
<p>The headstone of the man who gave his name to Robertstown is to be repaired more than 100 years after his death. The project is part of other works at the cemetery, which is eligible for assistance from the Council’s Heritage Fund and from the State heritage Fund.</p>
<p>John Roberts was a storekeeper who traded from a wagon and then in 1874 opened a village post office. The mail was stamped ‘Roberts Town’ and this evolved into Robertstown.</p>
<p>[The article contains mention of Emu Flats, Apoinga and Emuville and seems to imply they were the same town, when they were quite separate entities. Oddly the accompanying photograph shows the headstone already repaired.</p>

<p>Mr John Roberts, a very old Burra resident died last Saturday. He came to Burra in 1850 and carried on a grocery business for several years. He moved to Robertstown about 26 years ago and set up a store there. That town is named after him. He died from mortification setting in following cutting his toenails. The funeral was largely attended in the Kooringa Wesleyan Church with Rev. R.S. Casely officiating.</p>

Originally aimed at low cost accommodation by families, the cottages attracted a more affluent clientele.

<p>Leo Robinson: An interesting life.</p>
<p>At 16 Leo moved from Adelaide to Lilydale Station near Broken Hill, but after two years with sheep decided he would like to try his hand at cattle.</p>
<p>In 1952 on a visit to Adelaide, he approached Sir Sidney Kidman’s office and was offered a job on Glengyle Station, north of Birdsville, to be part of a four man team driving 900 head of cattle from Durrie Station near Birdsville to Marree. The team utilised 30-40 horses to ride and to carry supplies as packhorses. The five week trip in November and December averaged about 10 miles [16 km] a day. Each man had a bedroll and each undertook night shifts of 21⁄2 to 3 hours watching the cattle to prevent them from straying. Artesian water from bores was relied upon en route for all needs. These bores were thirty miles [48 km] apart, meaning the cattle would go two days without water and making them hard to handle when they eventually smelt the next supply. Firewood was very scarce and its lack gave the cook an excuse to feed them on salted meat and damper – yabbies from dams were an occasional treat. Mulka Store halfway down the track was the only shop and it provided luxuries like tobacco and Kraft cheese. From Marree the cattle were railed to Adelaide. Leo undertook many trips down the Birdsville Track in the 1950s. He also worked on stations when anything up to 30 men would be employed, where now the property is run by only two. After his first trip Leo returned to Adelaide for Christmas and returned north by hitching a ride with legendary mailman Tom Kruse. [2 photos.]</p>

<p>Article on Mulesing Sheep</p>
<p>Mulesing is the removal of strips of wrinkly wool-bearing skin from around the backside (breech) and tail of sheep. It has been a common practice as a way to reduce the incidence of fly-strike on Merino sheep.</p>
<p>A US-based animal rights organisation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has campaigned against it as cruel and inhumane.</p>
<p>The campaign threatened the livelihood of wool producers and the entire wool industry in Australia.</p>
<p>The Australian Wool &amp; Sheep Industry Task Force has decided to phase out the practice by 2010.</p>
<p>Information sessions in the area have been well attended.</p>
<p>One alternative being used is fly-strike chips. These are attached to the skin normally removed by mulesing and restrict the blood flow. This causes the skin to wither. It and the biodegradable chips then fall off in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>[The process is named after J.H.W. Mules an Australian farmer who died in 1946. A report in the Burra Record on its performance in 1943 at Mt Bryan rather suggests it was relatively new at that time. Another in 1970 suggests its popularity grew rapidly in the late 1960s.]</p>

<p>Goyder Council</p>
<p>Two Burra Ward Councillors have spoken out against the Council’s handling of Burra’s future; especially the destruction of Burra’s tourism assets by selling off items to private enterprise. The proposed sale of Burra Caravan Park and the handling of the Paxton Square Cottages question has angered Cr Adrian Gill who says the fate of the town is being decided by Councillors representing wards outside of Burra. He is contemplating resigning from Council. Cr Peter Reilly echoed Cr Gill’s sentiments. The sale of the Burra Caravan Park was supported by Crs Mattey, Mosey, Partington, Pfitzner and Bradley and opposed by Crs Peter Reilly and Adrian Gill.</p>
<p>The Caravan Park operates at a profit, but there is pressure to upgrade facilities and services. CEO John Brak said Council had taken the responsible decision to review its business operation and determine its value and market position prior to making any long term decisions. This had included calling for expressions of interest in the transfer from the Council of the business assets (or part thereof), though not the ownership of the land.</p>

<p>Goyder Mayor, Peter Mattey responds to letters critical of the Council’s actions on Paxton Square and the Burra Caravan Park. He stresses that no decision had been made on the future of the Burra Caravan Park. While the park is presently financially sustainable, there is increasing pressure to upgrade the facilities. It is therefore responsible to review its operations. The seeking of expressions of interest in transferring the business and assets from the Council is part of that review. (The sale of the land is not included.) Council had adopted a recommendation from the Paxton Square Cottages Community Committee to move to short term rental to maximise income once existing arrangements had expired on 31 August 2008. This resulted in the employment of an on-site manager to operate the cottages for short term rental on the Council’s behalf from 1 September 2008 to 30 June 2009. The Council will be in abetter position to assess the sustainability of the cottages early in 2009 and will consult with the Community prior to making any decision.</p>

<p>Letter. Helen Szuty for the Ratepayers’ Action Group writes concerning the public meeting for ratepayers at the Burra Town Hall on 4 September. So far only Crs Gill and Reilly have accepted the invitation to attend. The meeting is called to consider a range of topics including:</p>
<p>Recent rate increases.</p>
<p>The direction of Paxton Square Cottages.</p>
<p>The future of the Burra caravan and camping Park.</p>
<p>The prospects for Burra Community Swimming Pool.</p>
<p>Letter. Steve Boyes writes opposing the proposal to spend $8 million on a sports centre at Eudunda. It would, he believes, be more beneficial to invest in promoting tourism, in upgrading Paxton Square and urges people to think about something big that would attract tourists to the whole region and SA generally.</p>
<p>Letter. Marj. Edmonds writes calling for ideas on how to promote tourism. She begins with suggesting a large pictorial sign near the start of the bypass, to direct people into the town. She calls for a concerted community effort to produce ideas and for volunteers to keep the current attractions open for longer.</p>

<p>Public Meeting of Ratepayers at Burra Town Hall last Thursday – chaired by Mark Parnell MLC (Greens).</p>
<p>The Council was represented by Mayor Peter Mattey and Crs Bradley, Gill, Mosey and Reilly.</p>
<p>Many speakers stressed their concern over the future of the town’s assets and the effect of changes on tourism. Concern was greatest about Paxton Square Cottages and it became clear that there had been a lack of communication between the Council and the community on that issue. The transparency of the way the Council was handling the Burra Caravan Park issues was also questioned by a number of people. Mr Mattey was quick to answer many of the questions. There was popular support for ongoing public consultation.</p>
<p>Helen Szuty considered it had been a constructive and productive night, though she was not confident that the community had really been heard. The Mayor expressed disappointment that more of the younger members of the community had not attended.</p>

<p>Burra Cycling Race</p>
<p>Held every year since 1907 except for gaps during WWI, WWII and the early 1950s. The first race from Burra to Adelaide of 110 miles ended at the City Baths (Adelaide Festival Theatre site). In the early years Burra to Adelaide races alternated with Adelaide to Burra races. With the advent of traffic lights in the city the race could no longer terminate there and other courses were devised, finishing at Uley Road, Elizabeth, but again traffic conditions forced further change and since 1985 loops starting and finishing in Burra have been devised. The 100 km 2008 Megafert Burra Classic was won by Reuben Menaud-Young.</p>
<p>[This article is a mixture of incorrect and misleading statements. I have not done the research needed for a definitive description of the history of the event, but a few points from reports in the Burra Record will indicate some of the problems in accepting the above.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In 1947 the Burra Mayor is reported as saying that he hoped that some day the race would be run from Adelaide to Burra – perhaps in the following year. He would hardly be saying that if the race had been alternating its direction from ‘the early years’. There was a period from 1948 when a roughly alternating pattern emerged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were gaps during WWI &amp; WWI – though not for all of the war years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a significant gap between 1925 and 1933 when the race was replaced by routes that did not include Burra, as listed (with winners) below:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>1925 C. Hutton (96 miles: Kapunda-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)</p>
<p>1926 H. Opperman (96 miles: Kapunda-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)</p>
<p>1927 F. Arthur (108 miles: Kapunda-Waterloo-Auburn-Tarlee-Adelaide)</p>
<p>1928 A. Smith (130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)</p>
<p>1929 H. Opperman (130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)</p>
<p>1930 F. Kennewell (130 miles: Adelaide-Mt Pleasant-Kapunda-Tarlee-Adelaide)</p>
<p>1931 A. James</p>
<p>1932 K. Synnett (155 miles: Adelaide-Kadina-Pt Pirie)</p>
<p>1933 J. Ryan (60 miles: Adelaide-Templers-Adelaide)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>In the 1950s the picture is more complex. The race was held 1950-52 and in 1953 the Burra-Adelaide race was stage three of the three-day ‘Advertiser Tour’. In 1954 &amp; 1955 The ‘Advertiser Tour’ passed through Burra, but the local paper’s report suggests it was not a Burra-Adelaide race. The Adelaide-Burra event was revived in 1956 by the Goodwood Cycling Club. The Norwood Club’s involvement came rather later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The finishing point in or near Adelaide did not just move to Elizabeth when traffic lights appeared in the city centre. Work is needed on this, but it had a number of finishing points – one Burra Record report has an end point at the Windmill Hotel at Enfield and another ended at Modbury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bit of research could probably establish the routes and winners and very likely the times and distances too, but until this is done we will just have to beware of accepting unchecked reports.]</p>

<p>Burra History Group</p>
<p>Meredith Satchell lived in Burra to the age of 13 and it was not until she returned to the town in 2001 that her obsession with the town’s history grew. Her chance meeting with Eric Fuss resulted in endless hours of joint effort on town and family history. Meredith started a small website, which soon attracted questions from people with family connections to Burra and the district. One such enquiry came from Rosemary Ros, now living in North Carolina. She wanted some information on the Pearce Family of Pearce’s Building in Commercial Street. She was so grateful for the help received that she offered to set up a new website for The Burra History Group. This now provides information on a broad range of topics and is an invaluable research tool, especially for those living interstate or overseas. Eric Fuss has been summarising every copy of the Burra Record from 1876 to 1976 [actually 1977]. So far the years 1876-1956 have been noted [except for a few years for which the hard copy is missing] and the years 1876-1940 have been published on a CD – equivalent to some 5,000 A4 pages. The Burra History Group appreciates any photo or document from the past so that it can be preserved digitally. Meredith is currently collecting photographs on Burra’s servicemen and women. Since 2005 the Burra History Group has maintained an extensive display of historical photographs in the refurbished Burra Town Hall and this is open free to the public. In 2007 with a grant from the Goyder Council they purchased a computer to aid family history research and to store all relevant records/documents and photographs they could find. The group strives to preserve Burra’s history for generations to come. [Photos of Meredith.]</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station</p>
<p>This once proud building is under threat from decay unless financial assistance can be found to save it. It is currently leased to Burra Regional Art Gallery and it is hoped that with community support it can be restored as a museum and resource centre.</p>
<p>A sub-committee headed by Roger Cross has been formed to help champion the cause. He said the station would have been restored long ago had it been located in the heart of the town. The SA Museum is keen to establish a museum for the display of mega fauna and with so much of that being discovered at Redbanks near Burra, the town is a superb location for a museum and working research centre.</p>
<p>Roger suggested the first step is a grant of up to $1,000 to free the building of pigeons and secure it from their entry. Further grants for a building and costing survey would then be needed. Volunteers will help, but professional tradespersons will be needed and early estimates put the cost of work at $150,000 to $200,000. It is estimated that the town gets 120,000 to 150,000 visitors a year and the restoration of the station would help to link the northern and southern parts of the town. The original Burra Station was a low cost wooden structure erected in 1870. That was replaced with the existing building in 1883 and this originally included a large arched roof over the tracks, which was removed in 1935. [Photos.]</p>

<p>Public Meeting last Wednesday [Eudunda?] was attended by Mayor Peter Mattey, Representatives of the Mid North Regional Development Board, Tony Stacey Consultants and the [Eudunda] Oval Working Party. About 85 members of the public attended. Plans for the $8.15 million centre were outlined and questions followed.</p>
<p>[Financial sources are listed.]</p>
<p>The Ratepayers’ Action Group has expressed concern over the proposed $8 million plan. Spokesperson Helen Szuty says no public consultation has occurred with the communities at Burra, Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie – more than 50% of both the area and population of the Regional Council. Mayor Mattey said the Council had neither discussed nor committed loan funds and a decision to support the concept did not imply that the Council would fund the concept in any form. Detailed economic research would be needed to be submitted to the community for consideration.</p>

<p>Letter. Anne Royal writes suggesting that Eudunda Sports Complex is an attempt to prevent the centre from becoming a ghost town. While not wishing to see any town in Goyder become a ghost town, she thinks this may not be a very good premise on which to build so expensive a complex. Perhaps other issues such as employment need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Letter. Barry Wright writes from his experience of managing a row of six B &amp; B cottages in Burra, expressing some ideas about Paxton Square. The advisory group could learn from the operation of community hotels at Renmark and Loxton. Burra Golf Club got the community to guarantee a loan to upgrade their greens. Paxton Square could do likewise. Alternatively a resort company could be approached to lease the cottages. They would have the expertise and the money to lift the profile of the cottages. The Council has been unsuccessful for about 25 years.</p>

<p>Burra World Heritage</p>
<p>Supporters of World Heritage Listing for the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape have approached the SA Heritage Council, which is now preparing a nomination to have the Sa Cornish Mining Site – incorporating Burra &amp; Moonta Mines – on the National Heritage Listing with the view of then proceeding to the World Heritage Tentative List. The Cornwall &amp; West Devon Site was World Heritage Listed in 2006.</p>
<p>Abandoned Mines Project senior geologist Greg Drew said such recognition would bring tangible socio-economic benefits to the region. It would draw conservation funding and international tourism. The ultimate aim is to have a Transnational World Heritage Listing including Cornwall-West Devon, South Australia, Mexico, Spain and South Africa; all of which have Cornish mining sites. National listing is a necessary first step. After that national government support would be necessary. A Mining Heritage Working Party has been set up. Heritage officials will visit Burra and Moonta Mines 3-4 November and community meetings will be included. Keynote speakers will be two English experts on Cornish mining heritage:</p>

<p>Last year the appeal to raise funds for the purchase of the Burra Record printing equipment and other relics saw about $4,200 raised – a shortfall of $1,800. Recently the Advertiser Newspaper Limited donated $1,800, which has been received on behalf of the town by the National Trust Chairperson Maureen Wright to complete this important historical purchase and secure the collection for Burra. The donation followed a suggestion from Burra resident David Bunney that the Advertiser be approached. It is hoped some time in the future to set it up and have it working again. It is certainly a valuable collection.]</p>

<p>Burra’s Unicorn Brewery has been revived after a 106 year absence and will soon be quenching the thirst of Burra, Adelaide and SA drinkers generally. The original brewery was established as the Unicorn Brewery in 1873 by William Banks and closed in 1902 under the ownership of the Walkerville Brewery, when strict licensing laws spelt the end of many of SA’s independent breweries. The new company will produce a Classic Pale Ale (5% alcohol) and a Miners’ XXX Stour (6.2% alcohol), with three other varieties to be added soon. The beer will be available in bottles and on tap at Burra hotels and elsewhere across the state. The company occupies offices in part of the original buildings and will use the bluestone cellars for functions and events. The beer is currently being made in Sydney and Adelaide, but the management is assessing sites for building its own brewery. In its heyday the old brewery supplied beer to a wide area of SA, transporting it by rail throughout the Mid North and to Broken Hill.</p>
<p>Celebrations to mark the re-establishment will be held on Sunday 16 November and will include a street parade starting at 11.15 a.m. and ending at the old brewery cellars, where the official opening ceremony will take place. A highlight will be the Unicorn Brewery’s team of Clydesdale horses. The SA Pipes and Drums will lead the parade with Highland Dancers, followed by floats and other groups and a district band. The SA Pipes and Drums will hold a concert in the Town Hall on Friday at 7.40 p.m. After the opening, fine ales and stout will be available, along with wines and soft drinks. Food will also be available in the Burra Creek picnic area.</p>
<p>The Season. The outlook is grim after a promising start. Six weeks ago it grew dry and now there is no subsoil moisture. Canola has also been adversely affected by high winds. Many crops are being cut for hay, although it is really too early, but there is no chance now of further improvement. In addition fertilizer costs have at least trebled.</p>

<p>Saltbush Clothing celebrates its 20th birthday. Twenty years ago Elspeth Radford established the business, inspired by a lack of smart durable clothes. She and Graham Radford set up Saltbush Clothing Co. in a farmhouse outside Burra to fill a need for hard-wearing casual clothes that were well designed and attractive. Before long the business had grown to a shop in Burra and now the company sells more than 40,000 garments annually in more than 120 retail outlets across Australia.

<p>The Burra Community Development Program (The Town Hall Committee) held its AGM last Thursday in the superbly restored Burra Town Hall. Between March and June the Civic Room was restored by the wonderful efforts of Roy Taplin, assisted by Brenda Taplin. A Goyder Heritage grant of $1,000 paid for paint, but the results come from the thousands of dollars of in-kind volunteer labour. The Burra History Group members have organised the remounting and framing of photographs of ten of the town’s former mayors, which now add historic interest to the room. The remaining mayors’ photographs will be added in due course. The old lodge room has seen the addition of a display of lodge regalia and an early town streetlamp, donated by Bob Perry of ‘Gaslight’, for which Roy Taplin made a replica lamp post. Chairperson Meredith Satchell said that there had been 7,686 visitors for the year and they had donated $3,311. Many of them were interstate visitors. The refurbishment has created a vibrant, active community venue.</p>

<p>Unicorn Brewery</p>
<p>The streets were lined with more than 500 locals and visitors on Sunday morning for the Unicorn Brewery Parade, heralding the re-establishment of the historic Burra Brewery. [Though the company actually had no brewery either in Burra or anywhere else!] The parade was led by the SA Pipes &amp; Drums, followed by the pair of Unicorn Brewery Clydesdales hauling a trolley. Brewery Director Jason Watters then led a majestic white ‘unicorn’. [Photo.]</p>
<p>At the Brewery Rev. Michael Hillier blessed the unicorn, the people and the brewery. Rowan Ramsey Federal MP for Grey then declared the Unicorn Brewery open and the crowd then enjoyed the beer, food and the rest of the day’s activities. There was a barbecue and pancakes in the adjacent picnic area.</p>
<p>According to Mr Watters the low carb ‘Horny Blonde’ was popular with all, but especially the ladies. Men were somewhat more drawn to the Miners XXX Stout. Unicorn Pale Ale, he said, was more of a favourite with drinkers from the urban area. Sales exceeded expectations and the firm donated a carton of beer to be auctioned to raise funds for the McGuiness/McDermott Foundation for Children with Cancer. Purchasers of the carton returned it several times and ultimately $5,000 was raised.</p>

<p>Letter. An anonymous writer urges that something be done to reduce or stop hoon driving in Burra at night.</p>
<p>Letter. Pip Edson, as chairperson of the Burra Regional Art Gallery writes urging support for the spending of a recently allocated $100,000 from the federal government’s Regional &amp; Local Community Infrastructure Program, on upgrading the exteriors of the Burra Town Hall and Regional Art Gallery, to enhance what are already two magnificent historically significant buildings. A 1978 plan contemplated landscaped and planted areas and access roads. Consultants in 2003 proposed a plan for loading and disabled access. Neither plan has been implemented, and the completion of these ideas would fall well within the guidelines of the Infrastructure Program. Roy Taplin’s work in painting and renovation amounts to $65,440 of in-kind input, so the $100,000 of federal funding seems a fair return for the preservation of the buildings and grounds for the enjoyment of future generations.</p>

<p>Rural Youth is being wound up as an organisation after more than fifty years. The Burra Branch was very active in the movement’s heyday. The club organised many social events, including balls, weekend rallies and camps. Clubs competed against each other in both skilled and fun events. Skills learned included meeting procedures, debating, public speaking, stock judging, dressmaking and cooking. Training was offered for competitions in shearing, photography and public speaking among other things.</p>
<p>The wind-up followed an enquiry from the office of the Minister of Agriculture concerning its status and the Supreme Court appointed a liquidator on 18 November 2008. A meeting on 18 December will hear submissions on the distribution of the organisation’s $60,000 of assets.</p>

<p>Eudunda’s Goyder Sports &amp; Community Centre</p>
<p>The Council voted last week to allow the $8.8 million centre to proceed to the next stage. Funding would come from the sale of the current bowling club and community land, open space funding, AFL funding, loans, community fundraising and state and federal grants. A federal grant of $2.5 million will be sought.</p>
<p>Mayor Mattey warned that a shortfall in funding could see Eudunda rates rise by up to 25%. The progress of the project would now depend on the procuring of grants. Cr Pfitzner said every sporting club supported the move. Council has approved the erection of the project on Council owned land. Council loans of up to $2.5 million are part of the project. [Plans are printed.]</p>
<p>The Goyder Ratepayers’ Action Group is opposed – seeing a huge increase in the cost of servicing Council debts – Eudunda Ward alone could face $224,000 p.a. The group wants a public meeting to consider the matter.</p>

<p>Two letters to the editor discuss the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre to be built at Eudunda at an estimated cost of $8.8 million. Amanda Lloyd of Eudunda is sceptical and seeks much more information about the scheme and its financial implications. She wonders whether it would be better to upgrade existing facilities and urges all concerned people to ask questions and seek answers before deciding on the path ahead. Paul Schiller ECBaT Chairman and Nick Hambour Vice-Chairman of the Eudunda Oval Facilities Working Party write jointly to urge support for the scheme, seeing positive spin-offs for the whole region and expressing confidence of the area’s ability to obtain the necessary finance based on the funding obtained in recent years for other projects. What is needed is a vision for the future.</p>

<p>Burra History Group President Meredith Satchell said the group is planning to publish a new pictorial history of Burra because Ian Auhl’s Burra, A Pictorial Memoir is now out of print. The aim was to compile a book using photographs not used in Auhl’s publication, to bring the book up to date from his 1975 book and to include some colour photographs. An appeal is made for photographs, especially of the period after 1975. They would be kept only briefly for scanning and then returned. Not only is the book seen as a way to preserve the history of the town, but as a method of promoting its image to our visitors.</p>

<p>Weather. A severe weather warning was issued for Wednesday last. An alert for the Burra, Hanson, Farrell Flat, Koonoona and Gum Creek area predicted wild wind and lightning. Hanson farmer Dennis Short was out attending to one of four fires caused by lightning strikes in the Gum Creek area when a wild wind gust tore through his property, destroying an implement shed. The gust was a mini tornado. Torrential rain fell in a confined area near Hanson, while Farrell Flat area was dry with fires. Most tornados in SA occur in the winter months and generally closer to the coast.</p>

<p>Steven Reeves of Eudunda writes criticising the Ratepayers Action Group (RAG). He sees the usefulness of the properly instituted Community Management Committees, but says the RAG, while complaining of the lack of accountability and transparency by the Council, is itself lacking in transparency. It seems to have no terms of reference, no minutes, constitution or aims that are readily discoverable. Surely the group should have the necessary incorporation credentials and indemnity insurance.</p>
<p>Margaret Doecke of Eudunda writes expressing her fears concerning the implications of the business plan for the Goyder Sports and Community Centre. She draws attention to the amendment of the motion by which the Council granted permission for the project to continue. This amendment stipulated that the majority of Eudunda Ward electors at a council constituted public meeting had to approve, that there be Council approval of a loan or loans of up to $2,500,000 and that there be a reimbursement to council by way of a levy on the future Eudunda Ward rates of any financial shortfall in the construction and operation of the proposed centre.</p>

<p>Advt. Casey Cooper &amp; partner Melissa (Mel) Miller have taken over McPhee’s butcher shop in Burra. Casey began his apprenticeship with McPhhee’s in 2001. After completing his apprenticeship and working at the shop for more than five years he and Mel went to Canada where his love and expert ability in handling horses saw him spend time on a working cattle ranch outside Calgary. Missing the warmer weather and with Mel pregnant with their son, Cash, the couple returned to Burra. Casey became an accredited crane driver and was working for Clare Crane Hire when he heard that Gary McPhee had sold his Clare store. He approached Gary about the possibility of buying the Burra store. The couple are determined to maintain the long tradition of a high quality meat store that has been an institution in the mid-north for more than 22 years. As well as acquiring the business Casey has taken on the training of third year apprentice Cameron Daniels and first year apprentice Rory Muir. Gary &amp; his wife Joanne have eased the new owners into the job over the last few months and the official transfer took place from 12 January. Joanne &amp; Gary McPhee are now looking forward to ‘a good long break’. [Photo of Mel &amp; Casey.]</p>

<p>Market Square Museum and Lolly Shop has been given a facelift. It is expected to be reopened by the end of the month. The building is being repainted and sections of the walls are being repaired and re-pointed. The interior is being rearranged. There is a great need for volunteers to work in the various National Trust buildings said Branch Chairman Paul Marsson. The Trust would like to have a register of volunteers with a variety of skills, who could be called on when heritage buildings needed maintenance.</p>

<p>Two local fire fighters, Terry Daniels (48) of Burra and Trevor Huddleston (51) of Terowie, have returned from helping at the Victorian bushfires. They went to Churchill and operated mainly around the Redhill Road area. The devastation was heartbreaking. Their experience will be valuable in training local crews. [Photo of Terry Daniels.]</p>

<p>Steve Reeves writes to thank RAG for answering some of his queries put in a recent letter. RAG has no affiliation or association with the Council, has no chairperson, secretary or treasurer, and Ms Helen Szuty is their spokesperson. They meet monthly on Thursday s prior to Council meetings, but could not supply minutes, do not have a constitution and are attempting to become incorporated. They are not happy with all the decisions of Council, especially as Burra [Ward] rates continue to be the highest in the state. They oppose the sale of assets and the Goyder Sports and Community Centre Project.</p>
<p>Ruth Norris of Burra writes to thank organisers of the fundraiser at Burra Town Hall on Sunday for the victims of the Victorian bushfires and for allowing her to attend as a representative for the animal victims and for allowing an item to be auctioned on behalf of the animals.</p>

<p>Burra Rock ’n’ Roll Weekend has been cancelled for 2009 due to poor ticket sales. Event organiser Sue Ryan said a major part of the problem was string competition on that weekend from other events. The Day on the Green in Clare will feature Jimmy Barnes and is expecting a crowd of 6,000. Other events are the Marrabel Bull Ride and the Adelaide Plains Cup. The Burra hotel has traditionally hosted a rock ’n’ roll dance on the Friday before the main event on Saturday. Publican Bill Overell says they still intend to have a live band that night and they hope locals will support the event. The hotel has for some time had a live band every Friday, but rising costs for bands and lack of patronage have seen this now cut to a fortnightly show and if things don’t improve the whole issue of live music will have to be reconsidered. Organisers will consider rescheduling the event later in the year.</p>

<p>Victorian Bushfire Appeal</p>
<p>Members of the Sing Australia Burra Choir together with local businesses raised $4,000 in the Victorian Bushfire Relief Appeal Community Singalong at the Burra town Hall on Sunday afternoon. Around 80 members of the public joined in the singalong and donations of goods and services were auctioned to raise $2,367. Donations increased the total to $4,000. Event co-ordinator and choir leader John Fuss was amazed by the generosity of the public. The event was organised very quickly from an idea that came to John on Tuesday. A separate sum of $470 was raised for disaster-struck animals. As well as thanking all donors and the public, Mr Fuss gave special mentions to Darryl Venning for gathering all the lots from businessmen and to auctioneer Andrew Butler. Afternoon tea followed the singalong. [Donors are listed.]</p>
<p>Peter Opperman from the Burra IGA store is one of 1,270 independent retailers who will help provide food vouchers to fire stricken Victoria via the IGA’s Community Chest program.

<p>Notice. A full page notice carrying the logo of the Regional Council of Goyder and carrying the Council’s name boldly across the bottom lists the seven proposed resolutions from the Ratepayers Action Group for the forthcoming ‘Meeting of Electors’</p>
<p>Issue 1 related to rates. It was concerned about the high level of rates generally and the disparity across the different towns, and called for a general review of rates, especially for Hallett in the light of the wind farm development. Generally wanted more transparency and objected to the proposal to seek heavier fines for late payment of rates.</p>
<p>Issue 2 related to Paxton Square and contained a complex list of clauses aimed generally at keeping the cottages in public ownership, securing their preservation and development as a community asset in the tourist industry.</p>
<p>Issue 3 concerned Burra Caravan Park. The general desire here was to preserve and maintain the existing park with its ideal location and that any proposal to develop another park should be in addition. Overflow could be accommodated at the Burra Showgrounds. It also lists desirable upgrading at the caravan site.</p>
<p>Issue 4 was the Burra Swimming Pool. The resolution asks that Council acknowledge it is a valuable community asset that must be maintained and improved.</p>
<p>Issue 5 related to Council transparency and accountability. This sought to see the Mayor and Deputy Mayor abandon this title on the grounds that it incorrectly implies that the office is elected by ratepayers generally. There is a general call for better communication, more active engagement with ratepayers, better and more timely availability of papers, minutes etc. The call in general applies as much to Council staff as to Councillors. [Much more detail of course in the lengthy motion.]</p>
<p>Issue 6 about Goyder Sports &amp; Community Centre. The general thrust was against this going ahead, but if it were to proceed then only after very clear and valid approval from Eudunda Ward ratepayers and with careful provisos to ensure that any subsequent liabilities fall on the Eudunda Ward – even if subsequently ward structures aru changed or abolished.</p>
<p>Issue 7 concerned Representation Review. The request here was that the 2005 Representation Review and background documents be made publicly available and the SA Electoral Commission audit the Council Roll to ensure it is up-to-date and accurate.</p>
<p>[The resolutions are very detailed and take up most of the page in fine print.]</p>
<p>[The apparent attribution of this notice to the Regional Council of Goyder was a gross error on the part of the paper. They attempted to undo the damage by a letter drop to homes almost immediately and, of course, by an apology in the next issue. The responsibility for the notice should have been attributed to the Regional Council of Goyder Ratepayers Action Group.]</p>

<p>Burra Community School. The Liberal member for Stuart visited the school last Friday to investigate the lack of air conditioning in the heritage Kooringa Building. This follows a flood of letters etc. after the recent heatwave. The building houses the primary classes and the heat resulted in some health problems for students. It is unfortunate that the Commonwealth Government’s Building the Education Revolution stimulus package can only be spent on buildings and refurbishment and does not cover air conditioning.

<p>Burra Men’s Shed was officially opened last Wednesday. Darryl Venning had the idea for a men’s shed after learning about other sheds at Snowtown, Moonta and Pt Broughton. In December 2007 he found a shed that was previously used by the old Highways Department and after nine months of red tape and supporting phone calls district ranger to the new owners, the Department of Environment and Heritage, a five year lease was arranged. Donations and a grant from the Community Benefits SA Program, Regional Council of Goyder and a Seniors Grant enabled the shed to open for business. Assistance with paper work was given by leisure activities co-ordinator Verna Saunders and by John Monten, both of Lower North Health. John assisted with securing the grants and in supplying occupational health and safety equipment. Some of the activities to be carried out will be woodwork, metal work, painting and restoration of furniture and some electrical and computing help. There are currently 23 members. So far the shed has made toilet surrounds for Jazz in the Monster Mine, two plinths for the Burra Art Gallery and some large-scale wooden toys. [Photos pages 10 &amp; 17.]</p>

<p>The Regional Council of Goyder has held three of four scheduled Ward Meetings with Electors. More than 40 attended at Hallett, 47 at Burra and about 40 at Robertstown. These figures were lower than expected, but it did not prevent the views of the wider community from being heard. Both Hallett &amp; Robertstown had a feeling of ‘Burra favour’, but local issues soon dominated the discussions. The Eudunda meeting is scheduled for April.</p>

<p>Burra fire fighter Ian Kleinig is making progress after suffering a major injury while fighting the Victorian bushfires last Wednesday. Ian was working on the containment of the Murrindindi fires near Alexandria, about 60 km northeast of Melbourne, when he was struck by a falling limb. He was taken to Melbourne for treatment and his wife Annie and father flew to Melbourne to be by his side. CFS chief officer Euan Ferguson said the incident was a reminder of the unpredictable hazards faced by fire fighters. At the weekend Ian’s two sons, Josh &amp; Ben were also flown to Melbourne with their grandmother. Fundraising efforts to assist the family have been organised and a book for supportive comments has been placed at the Burra Post Office.</p>

<p>D.R. Woolley writes to say he is not a member of RAG, but does endorse their actions.</p>
<p>Jacki Mattey of Terowie writes to contest the view that the Electors Meeting at Burra was well attended with just 45 out of a potential 1650 or so present. The other two meetings were conducted in a co-operative manner with good communication, unlike the confrontational manner adopted by a small, but vocal sector of the Burra contingent. ‘Coming along with a lot of motions, the meaning of which either support the Local Government Act, or state the obvious, is basically a waste of time.’</p>
<p>‘Simple requests to the council are often just as effective as formal motions.’</p>
<p>Helen Szuty of RAG writes re the inappropriate badging of the ‘Proposed Resolutions’ from RAG. She considers that both the letter to residents and the apology in the paper failed to make it sufficiently clear that the error was the paper’s and not RAG’s. She is also disappointed not to have received a letter of apology to RAG from the paper and looks forward to its arrival.</p>

<p>Recycled Water for Burra. As part of the Federal Government’s fiscal funding program the Regional Council of Goyder has $100,000 for its Infrastructure Program. At its February meeting it discussed where to spend this. In view of the extensive work it has done at Eudunda in the recycling and re-use of treated waste water from the sewage treatment plant onto the oval, gardens and in the future onto the golf course, it was agreed to the introduction of a similar project for Burra. Council asset manager Trevor Wood says Burra has about 15 megalitres available annually from its treatment system. Designs are being prepared for a filter and chlorination system so the water can then be pumped through a pipeline to irrigate the oval, caravan park gardens, Market Square lawns and gardens and other areas as they become available. As an interim measure bore water will be piped to Market Square next week to enable lawns to be better watered and better managed. This will be replaced with recycled water when it becomes available.</p>

<p>Helen Szuty writes in response to Jacki Mattey saying she believes Jacki only attended one of the three meetings she wrote about. Ms Szuty says she believes the meetings were representative and successful in that the matters of concern to Burra ratepayers have been addresses and in the outcome the threats to the Burra Caravan Park, the Burra Swimming Pool and to Paxton Square have been removed. The resolutions passed at the meeting of ratepayers will be considered by Council as required by the Local Government Act. RAG believes without its actions there would not have been meetings at Hallett &amp; Robertstown.</p>
<p>Aly Fricker of Robertstown also attacks Jacki Mattey, accusing her of not understanding the dynamics of the democratic process. It is just because a vocal minority can dominate proceedings that a formal motion and voting on the resolution is important when it comes to determining the wishes of the meeting. She suggests that it is an error to regard the whole process of a legitimate meeting as a slur against the Council.</p>

<p>Norfolk Island Hibiscus trees in Morehead St will be removed after drought and severe frost severely damaged them. Nine of the historic trees will be taken out, having been assessed as unable to recover. The decision has not been taken lightly and time was given to see if they would regrow. Some people are allergic to the fine hairs in their seeds, so the continued planting of this species has not been recommended by the Landscape architects commissioned in 2005 to oversee the Council’s street tree program. The existing trees in Morehead St have been there for about 60 years. It is proposed to replace the nine trees with Kurrajongs. Pruning of other dead branches will also be done and further removals may be necessary where recovery is unsuccessful. [Photo included.]</p>

<p>Obituary. Up to 800 people attended a memorial service for Barry Stringer, a renowned North Eastern and SANFL footballer at Spalding Town Hall last Wednesday. He had died following a heart attack the previous week aged 57. He had played junior football at Redhill and then played for North Adelaide. In the SANFL he played 220 games and took part in North’s premierships in 1971 &amp; 1972. He was then captain for two seasons and won the best &amp; fairest awards in 1974 &amp; 1977. Throughout his SANFL career Barry travelled each week from the family property at Koolunga for training and the matches. After retiring from North Adelaide in 1981 he played briefly for the Proprietary Football Club Pt Pirie before becoming playing coach of Brinkworth/Yacka in its final year 1984. He was the playing mentor for Brinkworth/Yacka/Spalding for the two years it existed. When the Brinkworth/Spalding/Redhill club was formed in 1987 he became its coach, retiring in 1994 after seeing them to four premierships. He changed the style of play in the North Eastern competition said BSR club spokesman, Peter Meyer. [Two photos.]</p>

Analogue TV reception is more apt to be affected than digital and satellite feeds are unaffected. AGL had undertaken to overcome any problems for TV reception.</p>
<p>Fire. SES, CFS &amp; MFS and local police attended a truck fire about 5 km south of Burra on Saturday at about 3 a.m. A small area of grass was also burnt. The origin of the fire is believed to have been a mechanical problem.</p>

<p>Palaeontology Bus Tours</p>
<p>Burra hosted busloads of curious visitors to Red Banks Conservation Park as part of the SA Museum’s Palaeontology Week. There were guided tours on both Saturday and Sunday, starting in the foyer of the Goyder Council office, which houses an exhibition of fossilised bones from the Diprotodon supplied by the SA Museum. National Parks &amp; Wildlife Ranger, Kate Burton, gave a brief explanation of what they could expect to see before participants joined the bus. At Red Banks Adelaide palaeontologist Aaron Camens explained the importance of the Red Banks site and what work had been carried out to date. At the dig site visitors could see amateur and professional archaeologists working to find the remaining bones needed to complete the skeletal remains of a Diprotodon. The diprotodon was Australia’s largest marsupial, living in the Burra area a mere 10,000 years ago. They weighed in at one to two tonnes and stood two metres tall and three metres long. They are so named because they had two distinctive tusk-like incisors: di (two), proto (front) and don (tooth). They were well adapted to grinding up coarse tough foliage. They are believed to have eaten 100 to 150 kg of vegetation a day. They died out about 60,000 years ago. [2 photos.]</p>

The winning entries from the school will go on display in the gallery from 4 April.</p>
<p>Helen Szuty writes concerning Morehead St trees.</p>
<p>As the spokesperson for the Ratepayers Action Group I expect local residents to be consulted concerning the removal and ongoing maintenance of historic street trees in Morehead St. We have lived with these trees for 60 years and owe it to ourselves and the amenity of our community to make the most appropriate decisions under the circumstances. My own street survey identified only two trees that have actually died. All the rest have signs of regrowth. I call on the Regional Council to consult with residents. There are places in the street where trees have already died and not been replaced. Additional mature trees could be planted to fill these gaps. Street trees improve amenity, contribute to higher property values and provide habitat for birds and native animals such as possums. It is commendable that the council’s heritage advisor was consulted. All that remains is for the local affected residents to be consulted.</p>

Northern Sound System sponsored the event. Eight bands took part, including three from Burra: Toby’s Avenger, The Sore Foot Effect and Alibi. It was an alcohol free event and the crowd was enthusiastic. This was BOBfest’s third year and a final festival is planned for Clare in 2010. Over 400 tickets were sold. As well as the competing bands the audience heard last year’s winners The Secret Game and the Adelaide band Granny Flat.

<p>Burra Creek</p>
<p>The Goyder Council has approached the Community Management Committee to help manage feedback on the Burra Creek Planning Study. The task will be undertaken by a sub-committee led by Bruce Stockman. The initial phase will deal with the area from the Bowling Club Footbridge to the Caravan Park Footbridge. The aim is to enhance the amenities for recreation and enjoyment of the local environment. It is also intended to reduce the cost of the present arrangements.</p>
<p>[Photo of Bruce Stockman at the creek opposite the Town Hall and cross-sectional plan of the proposed changes.]</p>
<p>At present the operation of two bores costs $50,000 annually. Of this about $10,000 is spent on servicing the pumps due to poor water quality. 368 million litres of water is provided, but it appears that the creek lies on a gravel bed and a fault line, which causes a high loss of this water back into the aquifer. The present withdrawal rate is unsustainable. The west bank in particular needs further development to render it usable by visitors and the community. Ideas being considered include:</p>
<p>The lining of the creek with clay or an environmental liner to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>Combined walking/cycling paths for both sides of the creek.</p>
<p>A new recreation area on the west bank below the Town Hall car park.</p>
<p>Management of the weed/reed growth to provide bird habitat, but without choking the creek.</p>
<p>Planting with appropriate native trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>A prohibition of vehicular access to the banks to prevent compaction of soil and so extend the area of useful park.</p>
<p>A reduction in the area of the current water feature to reduce the cost of maintenance.</p>

<p>Burra Community Service will receive a boost. [In a flood of acronyms] it was announced by Country Health SA (CHSA) and Yorke and Lower North Health Service (YLNHS) that the town had become a multi-purpose service (MPS). This means that it will receive direct federal funding with greater flexibility on how it can be spent. After consultation with the community this could mean money spent on in-home respite, increased hours for the Leisure Activity Group, programs for young people and better access to early childhood services. There will be no change to the provision of acute services provided at Burra.</p>

It was stated that a more profession presentation could have been prepared if ECBaT still had access to the services of the consultant, who the Council let go recently.</p>

<p>Peter Brodie of Burra also writes on the above issue. He considers that the upgraded Clare sports complex and a plan to upgrade the complex in the Barossa Valley this year would both have an impact on the viability of the Eudunda complex. He is also concerned that the sale of assets like the Burra Swimming Pool, the Caravan Park and Paxton Square Cottages still seems to be on the agenda of some in Council, when he had thought these proposals had been put to bed.</p>

He was also surprised that it was ECBat’s own recommendation that the liability be Eudunda Ward’s alone: so it is not possible to blame either the Council or other wards for that.</p>
<p>Peter Brodie of Burra writes again on the Eudunda Sports Complex and again urges Eudunda ratepayers to be cautious. They need to note that any levy for a shortfall would be particularly hard on landowners with more than one property.</p>

<p>Cr Judy Partington of Eudunda writes enthusiastically supporting the Sports Complex proposal, urging its financial viability and imploring people to think positively and to look to the future.</p>
<p>Don Pfitzner of Eudunda Oval Facilities Working Party writes to take issue with E.B. Hawke who had questioned the health of democracy. He says Mr Hawke’s figures are incorrect and his remarks both sarcastic and offensive. He defends the planning and consultation processes that have led up to this stage of the proposal.</p>
<p>Peter Schiller of Eudunda also writes in support of the Sports Complex proposal. He thinks it would be a valuable and viable asset for which government funding is available. In any case, given that the Eudunda Ward ratepayers would be accepting liability for the costs, Mr Woolley and other opponents from Burra should mind their own business.</p>

<p>Burra Antique Fair was opened by ABC radio personality Peter Goers. It was the third time he has performed this task, though in fact at the last minute he handed the microphone to one of his regular callers, Peter McCullum of Booleroo, with instructions to declare the fair open. Peter duly found the words to do so, though he claimed that the only thing he had been asked to open recently was a cereal packet. About 1,400 people visited the fair.</p>

<p>The Goyder Sports &amp; Community Centre proposed for Eudunda at a cost of $8.3 million has been stopped as a consequence of being rejected in a vote taken by the Eudunda community. The elected members of the Goyder Council will now have to decide what form of any community centre will be constructed. The planning for the $8.3 million dollar centre has cost many thousands of dollars. The rejection occurred at a meeting chaired by Mayor Peter Mattey at which two questions were put to the Eudunda residents:</p>
<p>Do the Eudunda Ward electors approve of a Council loan or loans up to $2.5 million to assist in the cost of the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre and</p>
<p>Do the Eudunda Ward electors approve the reimbursement to Council by way of a levy on the future Eudunda Ward rates, of any financial shortfall, if any, in the construction and operation of the proposed Goyder Sports and Community Centre?</p>
<p>Mr Mattey acknowledged the hard work put in by the Eudunda Community Business &amp; Tourism Committee (EC-BaT) and gave a balanced approach to the issue. Then several people voiced their opinions for or against. After an amendment requesting a secret ballot was passed it took more than an hour to conduct the proceedings. A total of 292 voted with the results:</p>
<p>Question 1: 140 yes, 151 no and 1 informal.</p>
<p>Question2: 103 yes, 186 no and 3 informal.</p>
<p>[Photo of meeting and of Ratepayers Action Group (RAG) spokesperson, Helen Szuty]</p>
<p>RAG spokesperson, Helen Szuty, said the group was happy with the democratic process as the meeting. She could not respond to questions about RAG at the meeting because she was not a Eudunda Ward elector, but stressed that Rag was in the process of becoming incorporated and welcomed members from all over the Goyder Council area. She hoped that ECBaT would not be discouraged by the result, but would work to achieve more modest upgrades to community facilities.</p>
<p>Ian Kleinig, CFS volunteer, who has spent two months undergoing rehabilitation in Adelaide after being struck on the back of the head by a falling tree limb while working on the containment of the Murrindindi complex of fires near Alexandra about 60 miles from Melbourne, has finally returned to Burra. Damage to his brain resulted in blurry vision and a very slight speech delay, but he is expected to make a full recovery after a further 12 months of rehabilitation. Many members of the Burra Brigade, along with crew members who were on deployment at the time of the accident, were present at the Burra CFS Station to welcome Mr Kleinig home, together with CFS chief Officer Euan Ferguson and CFS Volunteers Assoc. CEO, Wendy Shirley. A scheduled media conference drew a contingent of cameras, recorders and journalists from various networks. Mr Kleinig said the actual events were more of an ordeal for his family, as he could not remember anything from about two hours before the accident. Fellow members Ross Haustorfer from Terowie and Geoff Millard from Georgetown said the burnt-out tree that struck Mr Kleinig was about eight inches around, but stood up to eight feet off the ground. Mr Kleinig thanked all those who had rescued him on the day and the medical professionals who had since provided care as well as all the well-wishers who had sent cards etc. Mr Kleinig had been bed-ridden for quite a while and is still recovering strength and fitness. He looks forward to gradually taking his place in the brigade as is health allows. He was part of the last wave of SA CFS volunteers deployed in Victoria. [Two photos.]</p>

<p>History Week in Burra</p>
<p>Two of Burra’s major historic buildings are turning 150 this year and the event will be celebrated in History Week. The National Bank on Market Street and the Bon Accord Mine Buildings are 150 years old this year. The Burra History Group will mark the occasion with a photographic display in the Town Hall from 22 to 31 May, open daily. On Saturday the Burra Branch of the National Trust will stage a free family day at the Bon Accord Mine Buildings. The first bank in Burra was a temporary branch of the National Bank which opened in 1859. Before then payment at the Mine was by money orders. The bank still trades in Burra from its premises erected in 1862 to a Georgian design, possibly by Edmund Wright. It reflects the prosperity of the mining town at the time and cost the then substantial sum of $3,000.</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Mine site contains buildings from two different eras representing very different functions: coper mining and the town water supply. The Bon Accord Mine site was acquired in 1846 by speculators from Aberdeen, Scotland. Despite hopes that the Burra Mine’s rich lodes would persist to the north, no ore was discovered and by 1849 mining had been abandoned. Another attempt was made in 1858 and in 1859 mine offices, a blacksmith’s forge, a carpenter’s shop and a manager’s residence were erected. These buildings survive. This mining venture also failed and work was stopped in 1862. Between 1884 and 1905 the town’s water supply was obtained from one of the Bon Accord Mine’s shafts. From 1905 the pumping of water moved to the mine’s main shaft and buildings in wood and corrugated iron were erected there. This remained the town’s water supply till 1966 when Burra was connected to the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline at Hanson and was supplied with River Murray water. Since 1977 the Bon Accord Mine Site has been owned by the National Trust and now houses a mining display and the manager’s residence is available as visitor accommodation.</p>

<p>The paper also reports the Burra Record’s article from 4 November 1958 on the Centenary of the National Bank and the 99th anniversary of its establishment in Burra. The Advertiser of 6 May 1859 page 3 reported that the opening of the National Bank in Burra had been a great success and had improved the circulation of money in Burra. Cash had replaced the money orders from the mine and the smelting works. It was reported that nearly all the principal tradespersons had transferred their accounts and savings to the bank. The affability of the manager has also tended to the success of the ‘Little Bank’.</p>

<p>Launch of a Photographic History of Burra</p>
<p>After eight years of research the Burra History Group is ready to release their book entitled Burra: A Photographic Journey. It will officially be launched by Professor David Walker of Deakin University at the Burra Town Hall on 8 June. Professor Walker says the fascinating history of Burra is beautifully told in the text and photographs assembled by Eric Fuss and Meredith Satchell. While the book does the old town proud their history tells a larger story of settlement, adaptation to hard climate and historical change. Prof. Walker described it as a visual treat and a pleasure to read. Meredith Satchell, President of the Burra History Group, said that Ian Auhl’s popular Burra &amp; District, a Pictorial Memoir, first published 34 years ago, is now out of print and this is the first book of the type to be printed since then. If it were not for the generosity of the District Council of Goyder, the Burra Visitor Centre, The Burra branch of the National Trust, the Burra Community Library and two individual donors the History Group would not have been able to fund the first print run of 200. The 246 page book with 64 in colour is in A$ format and sells for $50 [sic: error for $55.]</p>

<p>AGL’s Stage 3 Wind Farm at Hallett has been approved by the Regional Council of Goyder’s Development Assessment Panel despite strong community opposition. Hallett 3 Wind Farm will comprise 38 turbines. It will be the fourth AGL wind farm in the area after Hallett 1 at Brown Hill, Hallett 2 at Mt Bryan and the 63 turbines planned for Stage 4 at North Brown Hill. There was a public meeting on the issue at Hallett Town Hall on Thursday and 71 written submissions were also received. Of the submissions 23 were in favour and 45 against, with 3 being neutral. The company QED was asked by Council to prepare an independent planning assessment. It reported that while the development satisfied many planning provisions it did not warrant favourable consideration by the DAP because of significant visual impact. Other negative impacts would be the lowering of property values, constantly flashing red lights at night and the construction of new overhead power lines. Many also gave strong support to the concept. Landowners involved, Tony &amp; Kathi Sumner and David &amp; Jo Gebhardt, were supporters of the development. The final decision of the committee was made behind closed doors, a decision questioned by Mayor and Hallett Ward Councillor Peter Mattey, who also reminded the panel that its decision would have to be defended by sitting members of Council.

<p>Local History Book Burra: a Photographic Journey Launched</p>
<p>The Professor of Australian Studies at Deakin University, David Walker, was the guest speaker at the Burra History Group’s launch of its new book Burra: a Photographic Journey at the Burra Town Hall on Monday afternoon. President Meredith Satchell welcomed the crowd of about 45 people [actually closer to 70] and introduced Professor Walker. Professor Walker has strong family connections with the town dating back to the 1870s. He warmly praised the compilers of the book, Meredith Satchell and Eric Fuss, for their wonderful historic record. Mayor Peter Mattey was also on the stage and was asked to cut the ribbon to officially open the newly restored Civic Room at the Town Hall with its display of the photographs of past mayors. Guests were treated to wine and finger food while wandering from room to room taking in the many displays on Burra’s history. [Photos.]</p>

<p>Local members of the SA Country Women’s Assoc. will celebrate the organisation’s 80th birthday on Tuesday. ‘The association was founded in 1929 with the first SA branch formed in 1926 in Burra by Mary Warnes from Koomooloo.’</p>
<p>[This doesn’t seem to make sense. The Burra branch was formed in 1926 and a Spalding one followed in 1928. It spread to Adelaide in 1929 and it seems to be this growth into a connected web of branches that was being celebrated.]</p>
<p>By 1988 there were 270 branches with 7,500 members. The peak of its activities was reached in 1956 with 277 branches and 14,000 members. Past and present members are invited to the Burra Town Hall on Tuesday for a handicraft display and to wander through the Mary Warnes Room. The ‘SACWA Calendar of Cakes’ will be on sale along with other recipe books.</p>

<p>Hallett 2 nears completion. AGL’s new wind farm near Mt Bryan is nearing completion. The 600 tonne crane used in the construction is due to be demolished by the end of the month. There are 34 wind turbines in this stage. The construction team, which peaked at around 120 persons has contributed to the local economy which will continue with the design for Hallett 4 progressing. Site mobilisation is planned for late 2009. AGL has also completed a test television transmission from a potential site on Gumbowie Hill as part of its investigation into poor reception experienced by residents in Hallett and surrounding townships. A proposal on this will be presented soon to the Goyder Council. [Photo of Stage 2 in low cloud.]</p>

<p>David Winderlich, Democrat MLC has proposed a network of Heritage Highways throughout the state. A Copper highway could follow the old copper road from Burra to Pt Wakefield. A South East Gold Trail could follow the route of Tolmer’s Gold Escorts of the 1850s. A Goyder Ghost Town and Station Trail could thread through the unsuccessful farming areas of the Mid North and Flinders Ranges, passing through towns like Hammond, Johnburgh and Dawson.</p>

<p>Marlene Wooton has been recognised for thirty years tireless service to the district’s senior citizens. She was given a lunch by about 60 members of the Burra Leisure Activity Group. The LAG was her brainchild 30 years ago while she spent three months in hospital recovering from a back injury. It operated initially from a spare room at the Burra Hospital. For five years she worked as a volunteer before the Yorke and Lower North Health Service acknowledged the value of her effort by placing her on the payroll. They and the Council then helped in securing the old Aberdeen Football Club rooms at Burra North. YLNHS and LAG members were enthusiastic about acknowledging Marlene’s work over all the years. Marlene said the whole group of members and volunteers had become like an extended family. Marlene acknowledged the support of her husband, Gordon, and her children. She has won many awards over the years for her efforts. A presentation was made of a gold bracelet.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital Early Days</p>
<p>This historical account of the hospital was told by Alice Peak and Gertrude Williams, daughters of the late Catherine Watson who was the first trained nurse appointed to the hospital staff. She arrived from England in 1876 on the Oaklands where she served as a nurse for passengers. Instead of returning to England as planned, she agreed to go to Burra where a trained nurse was required. She arrived to very primitive conditions with the hospital was a converted hotel. Her first meal was served on the end of the kitchen table from a tin plate and pannikin, while the cook washed up on the other end of the table. An early achievement was the use of china for staff and patients. Domestic arrangements were crude, with waste materials thrown into a disused shaft on the hospital grounds. When she first arrived she was disturbed by the constant noise of the stamps (ore crushers) but this did not last long, as the mine closed soon after her arrival. Little surgical equipment was available and when an emergency arose and a saw was needed the kitchen meat saw was used to amputate a man’s leg. Operations took place on the old bar counter. When a typhoid epidemic broke out during the building of the railway to Terowie patients were so numerous that beds were made up on the floor of the old bar. Gradually the situation improved. The bar became the women’s ward and the long room became the men’s ward. Smaller rooms were used for domestic purposes. After two years Nurse Watson decided not to return to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in England, where she had been trained, but instead to marry C.C. Williams of Burra. A short time after her marriage the Burra Hospital purchased its first surgical instruments and Dr Brummitt came and took her to see them.</p>

<p>Local Heritage Boost</p>
<p>Five heritage sites in Burra will receive $400,000 federal funding for crucial conservation and restoration work through the Government’s Jobs Fund. The Redruth Gaol, the old Courthouse, Police Station and Lock-up, the Bon Accord Mine and the Market Square Museum will all benefit. The Minister for the environment and Heritage, Peter Garrett, said work would include conserving stonework, salt damp treatment and repairs to joinery, flooring, roofing and drainage. Water collection facilities would be improved, electrical services upgraded and painting of interiors and exteriors would be carried out. Senator Annette Hurley said the projects would result in jobs for local people. The sites are on the local Passport trail and their impact would boost tourism and the local economy. National Trust Burra President, Paul Marsson said it was fantastic news.</p>

<p>CFS &amp; SES joined forces recently in a joint Road Crash Rescue Course. Both services and the MFS deliver the same service in these situations. The course began with theory on Friday night and on Saturday and Sunday cars were skilfully demolished by hydraulic cutters and spreaders. Due to wet weather the practical components of the course were moved inside to Andy McBride’s truck yards main shed at Burra North. Each trainee was introduced to the various tools required in rescue before the group was divided into teams for a series of rescue scenarios. Everyone had to handle the heavy hydraulic equipment regardless of size, height or age and by the end their brisk steps had become a lethargic shuffle and lifting even a water bottle was a struggle. CFS officers Any Thomas and Tom Quin kept up the food supplies. Sunday’s activities focussed on the use of reciprocating saws capable of cutting through both glass and metal. The last road crash scenario had each team having to extract a casualty from a crash safely in 45 minutes. By the end each trainee was deemed competent. The two agencies worked well together. The course was headed by CFS state training officer Corey-jay ‘CJ’ Frazer. [Photo]</p>

<p>Australia Post is celebrating its bicentenary. To celebrate this event Burra History Group has set up a display of historic photos and information on the postal services in the district over the years. A postal service to Burra began in 1846 with the office then being the accountant’s office at the Burra Mine. The town got a fine post office building in 1861, now the Burra Regional Art Gallery. The present Burra Post Office was built in 1960. The local staff joined in the spirit of the bicentenary by dressing up in period costume for a day.

<p>Goyder Ratepayers’ Action Group (RAG) is seeking a meeting with the Minister for State and Local Government Relations (Gail Gago) over the Goyder Council’s Draft Annual Business Plan. Group spokesperson, Helen Szuty said they were seeking discussion concerning the council’s consultation process on the document. Many issues were discussed at Meetings of Electors and fifty resolutions were carried at the Burra Ward Meeting of Electors, she said. At last Tuesday’s meeting Councillors spent 40 minutes discussing issues contained in a budget summary and then resolved not to conduct a rate review and to develop a Burra Caravan and Camping Park Plan.</p>
<p>Such a plan already exists as part of a wider plan adopted in 2004. Council fulfilled the minimum public consultation requirements of the Local Government Act and its own Public Consultation Policy, hearing a presentation on the business plan by herself and Des Woolley. Ms Szuty said she raised a number of matters which required further explanation for adequate comprehension and recommended that Councillors defer adoption of the Annual Business Plan until issues raised at Meetings of Electors could be included. There had been no discussion in Council of the matters raised. Minutes say the presentations were ‘heard’. The Local Government Act 1999 requires they be ‘considered’. The RAG remains dissatisfied at the Council’s response.</p>
<p>Council CEO said that the Council had exceeded its own Public Consultation Policy by advertising in four papers and on the Council website with respect to matter. Copies of the draft Annual Business Plan were available at the Burra &amp; Eudunda offices for 25 days prior to the meeting, rather than the minimum 7 days. Interested people were invited to attend the council meeting to ask questions and make submissions relating to the plan or to make written submissions relating to it. No written submissions were received and only two verbal submissions were received at the meeting and those were considered prior to the adoption of the plan.</p>

<p>Collinsville Stud has been named Elders Supreme Clip of the year Award Winner at a presentation ceremony in Burra. The Elders Awards were established 19 years ago. Elders portfolio wool manager, Craig Eckert, said the state’s wool producers have set an exceptional standard in the preparation of their wool clips over the years, with the Collinsville group continuing a strong tradition. The Collinsville Station clip, JC in a triangle/ Collinsville, sold in M45A, was exceptionally well prepared and presented to the market place. It was classed by Dee Irwin. Collinsville general manager, Peter Whittlesea, said the award was a deserved honour for the people involved in the stud over the past five years. To be classed number one out of 3,000 across the state was a bonus. Several other local producers had been monthly clip of the sale winners, including J. &amp; F.

<p>Dulcie (Tiny) Hill nee Bourman is approaching her 95th birthday [on 11 July] and will celebrate the occasion with a small gathering of family and friends. She credits good living, hard work and a positive attitude for her longevity. Mrs Hill was born in Ayers St, Burra in a house built by her father. She was one in a family of five sisters. She left school aged 13 in order to earn a wage, going to work for Mr &amp; Mrs Marsden at the Burra Record as proof reader and office girl. She stayed there until the great depression when staff had to be cut. Tiny was lucky to get a job with Arthur Bence of Bence’s Limited, [drapers and clothiers.] She said entertainment at the time was sport, choir and local dances. It was through the Methodist choir that she met her future husband, Johnny Hill. She was married in 1937 at the Methodist Church and had a daughter, Mary [in 1951.] The family’s joy was tragically cut short when Mary was killed in a traffic accident in Market Square when just seven years old. Mr Hill’s tailor shop achieved a high reputation around the state and the couple worked hard both at their business and in community service. Mrs Hill also recalls the social occasions around the piano in the home of friends around the town. Bridge was another popular pastime. Johnny used to play weekly with the butcher, the barber, the publican and the Catholic priest, Mrs Hill recalled. Mr Hill died some 30 years ago, [actually in 1982] since when Mrs Hill has continued to help others. A three month overseas trip when she was 70 is a highlight of her life and the holiday of a lifetime. She relocated to the Chapel Street cottages five years ago and says she has never been happier, with very caring neighbours. [Actually she moved into the cottage occupied by Sylvia Pearce who died in March 2005.] [Photo.]</p>

He left the scene and when later stopped by a police officer, Sgt Jeff Allen of Mannahill, he stabbed him in the shoulder. He then stole the police car. Sgt Allen was taken to Peterborough Hospital and then by helicopter to Adelaide for further treatment. At about 7.30 a.m. Robinson attempted to run down Shad Mortimer of Robertstown, near the Spring Dam Station woolshed. Mr Mortimer escaped serious injury, but was taken to Peterborough Hospital.

<p>Burra Mine</p>
<p>The Burra Mine area has been officially short-listed for national and world heritage listing. Federal Minister for the Environment, Heritage &amp; the Arts, Peter Garrett, last week announced the Australian Cornish Mining Heritage Site (ACMHS), comprising the Burra &amp; Moonta Mines State Heritage Areas, has been included in the 2009 Finalised Priority Assessment List. State Environment and Conservation Minister, Jay Weatherill, welcomed the move. The assessment follows an approach from proponents of the world heritage listing of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape and the South Australian Heritage Council last October, who processed and prepared the nomination for the ACMHS. The ACMHS contains two areas declared under the SA Heritage Legislation: the Moonta Mines State Heritage Area declared in 1984 and the Burra State Heritage Area declared in 1994. Both sites have been managed as heritage places under state planning legislation and have active management regimes established by local branches of the National Trust and their local councils. The ACMHS was formed by extensive 19th century and early 20th century mining operations and contains five distinctively Cornish engine houses, one of the largest concentrations anywhere outside Cornwall. The site also features a number of other buildings, some in ruins and others intact. The two adjacent towns contain further elements of Cornish settlement in house forms and institutions such as Methodist Churches and lodge buildings. Their rich history already forms an important part of their tourism appeal. National and International listing would add to that tourism potential. The department for the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts will now prepare an assessment on the ACMHS for consideration by the Heritage Council. It is expected to be completed by June 2011.

<p>Burra Memories of the Moon</p>
<p>Pauline Venning (Burra):</p>
<p>‘I remember it very well as it snowed heavily all day. I was also nearly due to have my son Christopher and I remember my dad giving me a commemorative medal from ‘The Advertiser.’ We were sitting in the lounge room watching it on TV and it just blew us away to think that man was actually walking on the surface of the moon. It was really exciting.’</p>
<p>Ken Broad (Burra):</p>
<p>‘I remember the landing vividly as I was working at pruning roses and had to listen to the whole thing unfold on the radio, because my boss was too miserable to let me inside to watch it on TV. I thought the whole event was fantastically exciting.’</p>
<p>Chris Queissner (Burra):</p>
<p>‘I was shearing sheep on Rex Stockman’s property and it was snowing and we had to contend with wet sheep all day, so I never got to see the actual landing until I got home and saw it on the TV news. I still believe it was a waste of money that could have been better spent on our own planet.’</p>
<p>Jacqui Oates (Poonunda Station):</p>
<p>I was in primary school at the time and it snowed in Hallett, so we thought it was just a special day for us as we got to play in the snow all day.’</p>
<p>Elaine Ogden (Burra):</p>
<p>‘I found the whole day very exciting. I was in primary school in England and out teacher brought in a small TV. We all crowded into the class room and scrambled for the best position to see the screen – it was just fantastic.’</p>
<p>Kerry Spicer (Burra):</p>
<p>I was in primary school in Bute at the time and don’t remember all that much about it, only that it was a very important day in history.’</p>
<p>Danny O’Brien (Burra):</p>
<p>‘I remember sitting outside on the verandah and it was snowing. We had the television on and my mum was so frightened she thought the world was going to end. Mum always told me as a kid that the moon was made of cheese and I remember saying, ‘Hey mum I wonder if they’ll bring back any cheese’ and dad said, ‘Yeah, they’re clever, but I bet they won’t land on the sun.’</p>

<p>Robbery. Thieves broke into Monic Haddow’s Booborowie store last Wednesday night, stealing cigarettes, chewing gum and soft drinks. There was a break-in the same night, possibly by the same persons, at the Booborowie Bowling Club. Here they scored a small amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>Burra’s Annual Rock ’n’ Roll Weekend has been scrapped for 2009 because of poor ticket sales. Traditionally it has been held in February, but this year was moved to August due to several larger events being scheduled. The change of dates and probably the economic circumstances seem to have combined to make the event uneconomic. The Burra Hotel will still put on its popular Friday night rock ’n’ roll dance, featuring Paul O’Bryan’s Band.</p>

<p>New Burra Hospital Services</p>
<p>Burra Hospital has begun a program to give local residents access to services for which they had previously to travel. Country Health SA and Lower North Health services director Gary Stewart said the trial program for people with cardiac or respiratory problems has been successful and will continue. The program focuses on physical activity to assist with rehabilitation. Previously this had involved travel to Clare or Adelaide. Funding had been by CHSA, but now Burra has access to Multi-Purpose Service funding. This decision will involve a reduction of one bed in hospital capacity, but this could be reactivated if required. There is also the opportunity to upgrade the accommodation for some of the nursing home patients, to give better access to bathrooms and toilet facilities. These improvements will not compromise the number of beds available and are a great outcome. Darryl Venning, who is a member of the Local Health Advisory Council, has convened the first of a series of local meetings to discuss the present and future health service needs of the Burra Community. He said many people did not realise Burra Hospital has access to many allied health services, such as mental health, podiatry, occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Speech therapists and opticians come to Burra and work out of the hospital, so it is important that we use what services we have so they can be retained.

<p>Burra Community School children from years three to five gathered at the Burra Railway Station to mark the beginning of this year’s SALA Festival. The station was wrapped with yellow ribbon and bows as part of this year’s ‘sun and wind’ theme. This follows the decorative theme elsewhere in the town, with its yellow Balinese flags and yellow coolie hats. The children arranged themselves in front of the station to spell out SALA. The festival will be launched in Burra in Market Square on Sunday between 2 and 4 p.m. Local artists will sketch along the street. The Sing Australia Choir will perform with student band ‘The Sore Foot Effect’, the African drumming band ‘Tumbarum’ from Clare and the Burra dancers ‘The Burra Bootscooters.’ SA’s entry ‘Kelly’ in this year’s Solar Challenge Race from Darwin to Adelaide will also appear. There will be food stalls and a parade of children in hand made hats. The art gallery will have an exhibition called ‘Throwing Light’ and will host a SOLSA Salsa party featuring a demonstration of Latin dancing.</p>

<p>Patrick Le Vagueresse writes reporting a vandal attack on the Burra Baseball Club premises at the Aberdeen Oval. About $150 worth of soft drinks were stolen with some collectable baseball caps, first aid gear and a $300 fire extinguisher. In all damage costs amounted to about $750, which used up all the club’s funds, so that it is now unable to enter the Country Baseball Tournament for 2009. This is just on of a number of destructive acts around the town lately. Tourist sites have been another target. Surely someone knows something and is honest enough to come forward with information to help end these senseless acts.</p>

<p>Burra Tourism Precinct</p>
<p>Goyder Council has voted to support the proposed Burra Tourism Precinct as presented at the last Council meeting. The plan was presented by Chris Reed and developed by a group of Burra residents. It aims to develop the Council-owned tourism assets and bring them under the umbrella of a community-based board. The current situation shows no strategic direction for such assets as Paxton Square, the Burra Caravan Park, Morphett’s Engine House and the Brewery Cellars. The assets also suffer from a fragmented approach to long term maintenance. This has not been helped by Council amalgamation, which has tended to disengage the local community. The proposal would see the management of the above assets and the Burra Visitor Centre centralised to the old Bible Christian Chapel and controlled by a ‘Burra Foundation’. This body would then seek investment across government, private and corporate sectors. Long term lease arrangements for the properties would be established and an appointment process for the board would be set up. A more sustainable management program for the town’s tourism assets would be developed. A public meeting of ratepayers would ensure members of the community were able to express their views and to be informed. There is a need to solve the problem of the outstanding $200,000 debt on Paxton Square Cottages, as the Burra Community Group would not accept responsibility for its repayment.</p>
<p>RAG has welcomed the tourism plan and is pleased that the Council has supported the presentation.</p>

<p>SA Living Artists Festival (SALA) was launched in Burra at Market Square on Sunday when about 130 people congregated to hear former Senator Chris Schacht open the festival and to hear the Clare band ‘Tumbadrum’ and Burra band ‘The Sore Foot Effect.’ The SA entry ‘Kelly’ in the 2009 Solar Challenge aroused interest. A sausage sizzle and home made cakes provided sustenance and the Sing Australia Choir directed by John Fuss added their contribution, as did the three remaining Burra Bootscooters: Colleen Spackman, Shirley Broad and Pat Kakoschke. The festivities continued at the Regional Art Gallery where the ‘Throwing Light’ display was exhibited by several artists along with a Latin dance demonstration.</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station. The future of this historic building depends on the success of applications for Federal Government funding and volunteer labour by the local community according to Pip Edson, the spokesperson for the Friends of the Burra Railway Station. She has been somewhat heartened by a meeting with Dr Claire Smith of the Archaeology Dept. of Flinders University. Pip has also held discussions with representatives of the indigenous custodians of the land, Vincent Copley and Vincent Branson of the Ngadjuri people, with a view to its becoming an interpretive centre for the history of Burra prior to the arrival of white people. This would see the site combine a palaeontology display with indigenous people displays and perhaps a bush tucker restaurant. The Premier, Mike Rann, recently visited the station and expressed an interest in moves to conserve the station. The building has long been neglected and but for the efforts of Peter Harvey and Roger Cross in securing the lease through the Burra Regional Art Gallery, little would have been done to conserve one of Burra’s more important buildings. It would never have been allowed to decay as it has, if it had been located in the centre of the town. The Friends of the Burra Railway Station need volunteers at working bees to combat weeds, help tidy the site and prepare the building for painting.</p>

This will be their second attempt and this time they intend to follow the steps of Sir Cecil Madigan. He led the first scientifically base crossing in 1939 from Old Andado Homestead to Birdsville. They expect to take about 18 days covering 30 to 35 km a day with 4WD support vehicles. Their first crossing two years ago averaged 30 km per day amid dust storms and 46°C temperatures. Gill lost her son to cardiomyopathy when he was 15. She has previously cycled the Canning Stock Route and walked from Darwin to Adelaide.</p>

They lived in a couple of places before settling in Paxton Square and were the last residents to leave there before the cottages became heritage tourist accommodation. Mr Webb worked with the Highways Department for 25 years and for many years did odd jobs at the Commercial Hotel. After retiring nearly 20 years ago Mr Webb suffered heart problems and was grateful to be offered Meals on Wheels.</p>

<p>Bike for Bibles in Burra. Twenty-five members of Bike for Bibles had a rest day in Burra during their 4053 km hike across Australia with the aim of raising $100,000 to be used to support the Bible Society Australian Mission projects. They are riding from Perth to Sydney. The ladies of the church provided a pooled lunch and some of the local children made a large Bike for Bibles cake. This is the 25th anniversary of the movement, which began when three riders went from Sydney to Melbourne and raised $2,000 for the Bible Society.</p>

<p>Football. The BBH Rams are looking to make history this Saturday in the premiership match at Riverton. BBH have never been premiers since their formation 1986 with the union of Burra, Booborowie and Hallett. They have not taken part in a premiership game since 1988 when they lost to BSR Tigers. In the minor round they won 16 of their 17 games.</p>

<p>St Joseph’s Church, Burra was the focus of much attention last Wednesday morning when work began on the installation of a new spire, which had been absent from the tower for almost four decades. With the help of a crane local tradesmen first removed the cross and the existing timber platform from inside the church tower. They then installed the first of three section fabricated at Ashmore Engineering, Farrell Flat. The first piece was a six metre tall base, which fits inside the tower. Some slight adjustments had to be made to the second stage, which is the transition section from tower to spire. This delayed operations, which were then completed on Thursday when the spire itself went on relatively easily. Finally the cross was fitted on top of the spire and secured thought the centre of the structure. The spire stands about 4.1 metres has been absent for about 40 years. The original spire was sheet iron on timber and is believed to have been in place for about 60 years.</p>
<p>[Actually St Joseph’s seems to have had a spire from its construction in 1874; at least the earliest photographs from the late 1870s show it with one, though whether this spire was the same one throughout is unknown.] Father Quin is glad to see the architectural integrity of the building restored and says the parishioners have been quite excited and pleased with its return. It also looks particularly good when floodlit at night. He praised the work of Adrian Smith and team at Ashmore engineering and thanked Paul Wilson and his crew for removing the existing material from the tower.</p>

<p>Ruth Norris, local RSPCA volunteer, has nursed back to health a small Gould’s Wattle Bat found in a distressed state on the footpath in the Burra shopping area. It seems to have been disturbed from its hibernation during renovations to the store next to the Visitor Centre. These small bats are insectivores who eat up to 500 insects an hour when active. After a week of care the bat was ready to be released into its natural environment.</p>

<p>CWA’s 80th Birthday</p>
<p>Mary Warnes was a young girl from the city when she married Isaac Warnes [in 1900] and went to live at Koomooloo Station. Her sister married Thomas William Warnes [at the end of 1900] and lived at Old Koomooloo, some 7 miles away. They were quite isolated in the days before telephones and with horse transport. Once a week the sisters rode bicycles to a point about halfway between the two homesteads and had a couple of hours chat over a cup of tea. This was Mrs Warnes’ only contact with another woman. Years later the family moved to their ‘inside’ property ‘Wahroonga’ some 12 miles from Burra and Mrs Warnes thought about making the life of the outback woman less isolated. At a National Council of Women’s meeting in 1926 Mrs Warnes learnt what had been done in other states by the opening up of women’s rest rooms and this became her goal – a ROOM IN Burra where country wives could rest and relax, tend the baby, make a cup of tea and meet and chat with others on their infrequent trips into town. In November 1926 Mrs Warnes formed the Burra Country Women’s Service Assoc. This first organisation at Burra became the first branch of what evolved into the SA Country Women’s Association. An Adelaide branch with a rest room above a city store followed in 1928. Other branches followed. Mrs Warnes served as the State President 1929-41. In WWII was very active in patriotic activities, notably in providing meals to troops trains in transit from the south to Darwin via Quorn and Alice Springs. It was also the official camouflage net supplier to the Australian Army. Other activities of the CWA have included setting up retirement homes at Clare and Quorn, the establishment of hostels and a holiday cottage service. From the 1960s a changing economy saw more country women taking up paid employment. SACWA membership fell from 14,500 to fewer than 4,000 in 2000. Increasing regulation also saw the organisation relinquish many of its accommodation services. It retains its central headquarters and a hostel and remains as an advocate for country women and their families. It continues in the 21st century to provide relief in times of recession and natural disasters. It supports local communities, the Royal Flying doctor Service, funds cancer research and lobbies for better support for the education of country students. The CWA Café at the Adelaide Royal Show made $48,000 profit last year and Lauke’s scone mix and recipe book are its main fund raisers. Locally, in 2007, along with many other small branches, the Burra branch in the SACWA Goyder Group closed. The Southern Goyder Group has since been forced to amalgamate with the former Mt Remarkable Group to form the Frome Group with only eight branches remaining – Orroroo, Morchard, Wilmington, Yunta, Yongala, Jamestown, Booleroo Centre and Murraytown. The Frome Group is holding a Show Day at Morchard on 19 October.</p>

<p>Weather. Burra SES personnel were called to a house in East Street at about 7.30 p.m. on Monday night after strong winds caused the front verandah to work loose and fold back onto the main house roof. The movement also compromised cables to the main power box and power had to be temporarily shut down. The large section of verandah was secured with ropes until contractor builders were able to safely remove the damaged roofing. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Football. At the NEFL Grand Final Peter Man was awarded the man of the match award, but it could have gone to strong marking half forward Jason Schuppan, or the courageous on-baller Andrew Purchase. Schuppan kicked four of the Rams six goals in the opening three quarters. Marcus Hall and Mark Phin were also among the best. Aaron Spicer also did well and 15-year-old talent Tom Whittlesea also impressed. [Pictured: BBH Captain Stephen Tohl &amp; Coach Peter Whittlesea with the shield.]</p>

<p>Illegal dumping in the Goyder Council area costs ratepayers thousands of dollars. Andy Nicholls, natural resources manager said there were still some landowners who believed they could flout the law. This follows the discovery of 250-300 20-litre agricultural metal and plastic pesticide drums dumped in a gully on Hills Rd off the Spalding to Burra Road. They pose a serious environmental risk and would cost thousands to remove. There was the risk of serious pollution to neighbouring land. Mr Nicholls said a free Drum Muster collection would soon be held in the Council’s area.</p>

<p>Andy &amp; Di Smith of Melbourne write a letter to the paper reviewing their experience of a visit to Burra &amp; the Clare Valley. The tone of the letter can be judged from the paragraph in which they ‘wanted to congratulate the South Australian Tourist Commission on the magnificent job they had done to keep the attractions of Burra and the Clare valley a closely guarded secret from the prying eyes of outsiders.’ Their advice includes:</p>
<p>Avoid attracting hordes of tourists from NSW or Victoria – they might increase rural employment and transform currently unoccupied buildings into viable, but pretentious boutique small businesses.</p>
<p>Avoid any mention of the region in the media or on the web.</p>
<p>Don’t mention the [Boer] War and the making of ‘Breaker Morant’ and the Burra/Redruth Gaol connection.</p>
<p>Avoid World Heritage listing.</p>
<p>Don’t let it be known that Burra is a living theme park in brick and mortar.</p>
<p>Don’t let publicity attract wine snobs to the world class boutique wines of the Clare Valley.</p>
<p>Hide the fact that this region is a fine jumping off place for the outback.</p>
<p>Under no circumstance allow money to be donated or sought for the restoration of the Burra Railway Station – it might attract voracious tourists with fat wallets.</p>
<p>Keep the Burra Bakery’s Cornish pasties a secret.</p>
<p>Also make sure not to mention or review the excellent Indonesian restaurant, the White Cedars Café, run in Burra by Francis Walling and Putu Suta.</p>

<p>Weather. Severe weather conditions around the district early last week brought heavy rain and destructive winds. Significant damage to homes and property was reported from Spalding, Gulnare and Burra. What seems likely to have been a low level tornado swept across the district on Monday 21 September. Bill stockman’s Glendale property about 10 km west of Burra was struck by it and large gum trees were ripped apart. The same storm was probably responsible for removing the roof from a house at Spalding. At Glendale the house, sheds and windmill were spared, but trees were reduced to splinters and others had upper limbs torn off. Adjacent crops were completely flattened. [Photo of Splintered trees at Gelndale.]</p>

<p>Burra Rangeland Action Group (BRAG) held its AGM last week. Twenty-six landowners and pastoralists attended. Mr John Oates was re-elected chairperson, a position he has held since the group’s formation in 2003. Mr Oates said the group was very proactive in controlling pest plants and feral animals. Some 22 properties are now involved from the Hundreds of Wonna, Mt Bryan East, Tomkinson, Rees, Mongolata and Baldina. They are particularly concerned with the control of African Boxthorn, feral goats, cats and foxes and of course rabbits. The group is now ready to move into the next phase of biodiversity and water management.</p>

<p>The Burra Show held last Saturday was a great success with gate takings almost equalling the 2008 record. Professor Michael Tyler from the University of Adelaide opened the show. This was also the occasion for the granting of life membership to Pat and Bob Greet for their many years of service as secretary and assistant secretary. Both have given countless hours to the maintenance of the showgrounds and to setting up for the show and cleaning up afterwards. President David Thamm was very pleased to present the life memberships. As well as the exhibits, the rides were particularly popular. The Ali Baba ride and the V8 simulator car proved especially attractive. About 20 cars were involved in the ute and car competition along with a static display exhibited by Les Warnes and Roger Cross. The AGL Min North Shearing Championship was a strong drawcard and reigning Open Champion Daryl Andriske from Blyth successfully defended his title. The sheep dog trials were enjoyed and the Horses in Action continued a fine tradition.</p>

<p>The Bush to Burra Cattle Drive is pleased to have again been able to raise a significant sum for a variety of health services in the Mid North. On Wednesday 30 September the drive started with a social gathering around the campfire at Gum Creek before the start the next morning. MC Geoff Schell outlined the next day’s activities. Day one started out fine, but soon turned into a very wet day and night. Each day they travelled about 12 km. The food provided by a variety of community groups along the way was a highlight of the event. Visiting musicians entertained the group each night around a campfire. By day five the weather had become ideal for the finish at Old Canowie.</p>

<p>Eric Fuss, Secretary of the Burra History Group, writes to correct the statement in the paper last week that the 2009 Burra Sow was the 132nd. Although the first Show was held in 1877, a number of years have been missed since then. There was a gap due to lack of interest from 1886 to 1893. A very bad season caused the cancellation of the 1897 Show and the same reason combine with the outbreak of WWI saw the cancellation of the Show of 1914. There were also no shows from 1940 to 1945. This makes the 2009 Show the 117th in Burra.</p>

<p>Children’s Week, 24 October to 1 November</p>
<p>Burra &amp; Booborowie students and youngsters from Burra Out of School Hours Care (OSHC) have work displayed at the Burra Bank SA Branch.</p>
<p>Lower North Health Growing Healthy Kids Team hosted a Teddy Bears’ Picnic at the Burra Oval last Wednesday. At the oval for the event were representatives from AutismSA, the Division of Rural Medicine, Disability SA, Child and youth health, members from Woolworths in Clare and the Burra Scouts.

<p>Terowie Rural School will close permanently at the end of the term. The enrolment has fallen from 16 at the start of the year to just 8 in the middle of the year and 11 now. Principal, Des Deuter, said the decline in numbers had left a large gap in the social development and interaction with children of the same age and abilities. The number is too low for students to benchmark themselves against students from the same age and educational level. Sickness through the winter had meant that on some days attendance was as low as three or four. The old schoolhouse was established in 1876 and at one time it was the heart of the community. Students will attend either Jamestown (36 km away) or Peterborough (20 km away.)</p>

<p>Thomas Pickett plaque restored.</p>
<p>After being missing for more than two years the plaque on Thomas Pickett’s Memorial Stone was replaced last Thursday. Members of the National Trust and the Regional Council of Goyder gathered for the occasion. [National Trust Chairman,] Paul Marsson arrived with the plaque and the material to make it adhere to the stone. The stone was first erected in 1977 by the National Trust and the site was chosen for its proximity to the place where Thomas Pickett’s shepherd’s hut stood on Diprose Creek, Basin Farm. Pickett’s discovery of copper ore led to the establishment of the Burra Mine in 1845. Little is known of him except that he was a shepherd and bullock driver and by 1842 was working for William Robinson of Gum Creek Station. He was barely rewarded for his discovery and it was only after an appeal from the licensee of the Miners’ Arms Hotel that the Mining Association agreed to fund his funeral expenses.

<p>The Film Breaker Morant will be shown at the Redruth Gaol this Saturday to celebrate its 30th anniversary. It was shot on location at Redruth Gaol and other sites around Burra. Those making an appearance included Jack Thompson, Bryan Brown, John Waters and Charles Tingwell. Many locals also made an appearance. The event will also pay tribute to Edward Woodward, who played the lead role of Harry Morant, and who died last week. The event has been organised by Paul Marsson and Neil Nicholson of the Burra National Trust together with BRTBA. The film was directed by Bruce Beresford and scooped 10 awards at the 1980 AFI awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. The audience will be treated to a dinner of spit roasted lamb with salad and dessert and Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group has prepared a slideshow presentation of images taken during the filming. Market Square featured in the film and the whole production helped to put Burra on the tourist map. Now 107 years after the Morant and Handcock were executed Jim Unkles, a lawyer with 30 years’ experience in military legal matters, has lodged petitions with the House of Representatives and the British Crown for a review of the convictions and sentences. Lieutenants Morant and Handcock were found guilty of murdering Boer prisoners of war and shot in Pretoria 27 February 1902. Unkles considers significant errors in the legal proceedings make the convictions and sentences unsafe. Justice demands a review of the trials, the convictions and the sentences.

<p>The 30th Anniversary Screening of Breaker Morant drew a capacity crowd of locals and visitors. The venue was changed from the Redruth gaol to the Burra Town Hall due to the poor weather conditions. A book of poetry written by Harry Morant and donated to BRTBA by Gaslight Collectables and Old Books was raffled for $730. Neil Nicholson welcomed visitors on behalf of the National Trust. Diners had place-mats featuring pictures taken during the filming and were able to take them home as souvenirs. Meredith Satchell of the Burra History Group prepared a slide show presentation of the whole collection of these pictures. And the military lawyer Commander Jim Unkles spoke of his moves to have the court martial and its verdict and sentences reviewed. He illustrated his case with a power point presentation. The overflow of people, who had had their dinner in the supper room, then adjourned to the upper gallery for the film. The appearance in the film of many locals drew cheers and giggles from the audience, who thoroughly enjoyed both the meal and the entertainment.</p>

<p>Burra Tourism</p>
<p>It has been an exceptional year for Burra tourism. The Burra Visitor Centre has been filled to capacity on most days in the tourist season. Burra Heritage Passport sales have increased and hits on <a href="https://www.visitburra.com">www.visitburra.com</a> have reached almost 10,000 per month. Since March 2009 accommodation sales have gone through the roof with more than double the bookings for March and July than for the same months the previous year. Burra businesses stand to benefit either directly of indirectly from the influx and Burra residents enjoy a wider range of goods and services than would otherwise be available. There is a clear need to upgrade the Burra Visitor Centre. A larger centre would make it possible for clients to browse the information on offer. The present site cannot provide for more space and has at times become uncomfortable overcrowded. More shelving would make local produce more readily available also. It is imperative to have space for visitors to browse the internet for local and regional tourist information. Parking for coaches and caravans is also a problem. The Goyder Council is considering the issue and a solution cannot reasonably be long delayed.</p>

<p>Adchem has announced a project to reduce its environmental footprint in 2010. The company has received a $550,000 Federal Government Grant and will put this towards a $2.45 million project to install a two stage reverse osmosis waste-water treatment plant. This will allow reduction of CO2 emissions by 10% from the recycling of waste process water with a 55% reduction in the use of mains water and improvements in the efficiency of steam generation. The higher quality water will allow improved efficiency in boiler operation and steam production. In 2008 a trial of a reverse osmosis plant was run for about $100,000 and the process was proved feasible. Once fully operational the plant will generate up to 500,000 litres of high quality water per day for use in boilers, cooling towers and general process needs. The amount of mine pool water used will also be reduced by about 70%. The project will see the construction of two 160 x 120 m lined evaporation ponds with a total area of 3.84 ha.</p>
<p>The Adchem plant was originally built in 1969 and was then designed to process copper ore from the Burra Mine. Since 1993 the business has been owned by Ausminco Pty Ltd. It currently employs 49 people and operates a hydro-metallurgical process to convert copper raw materials to high purity chemical products. Today it operates the world’s largest single production facility for cupric oxide and basic cupric carbonate; producing annually 6,000 to 9,000 tonnes of cupric oxide and 1,000 to 3,000 tonnes of basic copper carbonate. The project is not expected to see a change in employment or production levels.</p>

She also expresses disappointment at the poor facilities from which the centre operates and urges the Goyder Council to make a decision in the immediate future to upgrade them, whether by the construction of a purpose built centre or the provision of an alternative site. The matter is of the utmost urgency and has been on ongoing issue with the Council for many months.</p>

<p>Gus Wenzel, Burra Community School’s Deputy Principal was farewelled at the end of year presentation night. He has been a teacher at the school for the past 25 years. He has been SAPSASA co-ordinator and in recent years has had a solid commitment in the area of Work and Vocational Education. He has been held in high regard by a broad cross-section of students of varying abilities and talents who have received help and support in work choices and life after school and many of whom have been assisted into employment. Despite being a small school, Burra Community School has had a significant impact in sporting carnivals all over the state. Mr Wenzel has been District SAPSASA co-ordinator and had greatly influenced the school’s sporting achievements and encouraged all students to get the most out of sporting experiences. Principal Jim Low said many students count themselves very lucky to have had Mr Wenzel as a guide in their career choices and their sporting accomplishments. He will continue in his role as SAPSA co-ordinator.</p>

<p>Burra Christmas Fair drew a good crowd for the floats and displays that participated in the pageantry and colour. At the start it appeared that more people would participate that would observe, but as the event started more observers appeared. The Burra swimming Club provided a barbecue and further up the street hot cappuccinos and biscuits were available. A giant jumping castle and other entertainments were provided for the tiny tots. Matt Reilly did a great job as emcee. The Burra Leisure Activity Group had the best float, The Wiech family had the best Christmas Light Display and Tom Wiech had the best decorated bike.</p>

<p>The Anglican Church of St Edmund at Booborowie was officially closed with a special service on 7 February. Rev. Michael Hillier of Burra delivered the closure document to the final congregation. Rt Rev. Garry Weatherill, Bishop of Willochra, presided at the service. Mary Shattock, who had been the organist for many years, presided at the organ for the last time. The foundation stone of the church was laid by Mrs A. Affolter in 1923 and the church, built to seat 80, was dedicated 20 July 1924. Before that services had been held in private homes and Booborowie Hall. Additions to the chancel and vestry were dedicated in 1928 and the church was finally consecrated on 8 November 1929. [See Burra Record of 27 November 1929.] The church has not been used for a number of years, but it was thought appropriate that there be a final service of Evensong. After that a short ceremony of secularisation concluded with the Bishop extinguishing the altar candles and carrying the altar cross from the building. The furnishings have been removed and the building has been sold, to become a home. On 6 February 1960 George and Anne Williams of Booborowie were married there and so celebrated their golden wedding the day before the final service. They spent the last few weeks preparing the building for the service. After the service the congregation adjourned to the Booborowie Hall Supper Room for a shared tea.</p>

<p>Hallett 3 Wind Farm proposal continues to divide the community. About 95 people attended a ‘Save Mt Bryan Fighting Fund’ meeting at Hallett Hall on Friday night. It had been organised by Dawn Booth, Malcolm &amp; Lyn Kelly and Bill Quinn to inform the community of the progress of an appeal against the proposal with the hope of gaining support with the costs. The appellants had earlier met with Channel 7 reporter Chris Warren. The appellants are contending an alleged serous negative impact on the environment, such as erosion, as earth moving and road works are required. They also allege a significant impact on character and landscape quality, and potential to impact on natural heritage. They also fear excessive noise. Local farmer, Andy Thomas alleges he and his family have suffered various health issues including sleep deprivation since the erection of the turbines behind his property at Mt Bryan. The first hearing for the appeal is scheduled for the Environmental and Development Court of SA in May. [Photo of opponents of the wind farm.]</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station</p>
<p>Last Thursday the Government announced a $200,000 grant to begin conservation and restoration work at the station. The announcement was made by the Minister for Conservation and Environment, Jay Weatherill in front of a number of community members including members of the ‘Save Burra Railway Station Action Group’, Regional Council of Goyder CEO, John Brak and the Labor candidate for Stuart, Sean Holden. If re-elected the government would immediately transfer the funds to the Goyder Council to help the Action Group to conduct the restoration. Mr Weatherill visited the site last year. It is intended that the restored building will be redeveloped as a palaeontology and archaeology museum and would showcase remains of mega fauna discovered at the nearby Redbanks Conservation Park. A research and educational centre there would also promote local Ngadjuri culture. The Burra Railway Station is a State Heritage place on the SA Heritage Register, situated within the Burra State Heritage Area. It was built in 1883 to replace an earlier wooden structure. The railway line dates from 1870. The Burra services were discontinued in 1985 and the line was closed in 1988.</p>
<p>[Note that the above dates for the end of services are incorrect. Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986. The last grain trains ran for the 1998-99 harvest in January 1999. The last passenger train was an ARHS special steam train on 19 September 1992. The line does not seem to have been officially closed. ARG ran the last movement on the line when it sent a light engine to Burra 12 March 2004. The line beyond Burra was taken up 1992-93. In 2010 the rails were still in place, though not serviceable, as far as Burra Station.]</p>

<p>Gum Hill Stud. The Lines family of Gum Hill Stud was recognised at the SA Stud Merino Field Days last Monday for their milestone of 125 years of breeding quality Merinos. The on property display attracted about 80 local and interstate visitors. The Stud has bases in Mt Bryan with senior principal Glan Lines and at Keith with son Justin and brother Haydn. The stud was established at Yarcowie in 1885 by John Ayers Lines with son George Glanville Lines later transferring the stud to Mt Bryan in 1916. Rail transport was then booming and rams were easily distributed to many wool growing areas. In 1926 George acquired land near Booborowie, which had been part of the Old Canowie Station. In 1946 Lance Lines, an industrial chemist by profession, took over the running of Gum Hill where the interest in measuring wool and meat saw a new stud policy evolve – let the sheep stand up [to] the rigours of nature. Feed efficiency trials at Waite institute in the 1980s showed Gum Hill’s sheep out performed other SA sheep.</p>

<p>Cricket</p>
<p>Burra Cricket Club has managed to get through to its fourth successive grand final in the Belalie-Mokota Cricket Association. On Tuesday the Assoc. management had awarded the second semi-final to Belalie-Mannanarie after ruling that Burra had fielded one unqualified player in the second semi-final. A player needed to have played three games to qualify for inclusion. Burra had assumed that his inclusion in a game called off on account of heat would count as a game, in the same way that one that is washed out would count. The Assoc. ruled him ineligible. Burra then had to play in the preliminary final to win a place in the grand final and also forfeit the home ground advantage. On Saturday Burra 3 for 122 defeated Bundaleer 116 and now move on to the grand final, which will be played 27 March at Victoria Park, Jamestown.</p>

Many locals had no idea such waterholes existed. Professor Rod Wells and Dr Adam Yates addressed an audience in the Town Hall supper room the day before the excursions and spoke of the dinosaurs and megafauna that have been found in the park. Tour guide Neil Nicholson said Red Banks needs to be used more. It is not really recognised as being part of Burra’s attractions.</p>

<p>Emergency Service at Burra Hospital Closed</p>
<p>Country Health SA has closed the emergency service at the Burra Hospital effective immediately. Residents will have to travel to Clare or beyond for emergency treatment. The closure was confirmed on Monday by a visit to the Burra Medical Centre by A Country Health SA representative. The decision will stand irrespective of any changes that could be made to keep the services at the hospital. Dr Lakman Fernando said he was saddened by the decision. He said Country Health SA was not satisfied with the service provided by his wife (Dr Dharma Dissanayake) even though they had been here only once. He said they were not even allowed to help in an emergency. Dr Fernando said the Burra Medical Centre was in danger of being closed, but the two doctors said they own the practice and would continue to stay open for the community, ‘even though it is not a viable business.’</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall has become one of the favoured tourist destinations in the town. The historic photographs, beautifully restored interior and the family history research facilities cause many to stay longer than they had anticipated. The dressing up facilities provided for adults and children are also appreciated by many visitors. The continuing success of this attraction depends on volunteers to staff the hall. [An appeal is made for volunteers to help keep the place open every day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.]</p>

<p>Burra Blackout: Burra suffered a power failure on Tuesday night from 6.50 p.m. to 7.40 p.m. Some 1500 people were affected.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital Emergency Service. The closing of these services, as announced last issue, has caused widespread community disappointment. The two local doctors at the centre of the drama are determined to stay in the town. Country Health SA issued a statement saying: ‘There are no changes to services offered at the Burra Hospital.’ And ‘Members of the local community who require medical attention are encouraged to attend the Burra Hospital as they normally would. During a skills assessment it was determined that the role of one private contracted General Practitioner at Burra Hospital should be limited to long-stay patients in the residential aged care section.’</p>
<p>The two local doctors deny that any such assessment took place. Two directors came to Burra and had a chat over dinner at a local hotel, they said. Dr Lakman Fernando said his wife had full Australian qualifications and was fully certified to treat emergencies.</p>
<p>The situation at present is that GPs from Clare will provide emergency services when required. Nurses will remain at Burra Hospital to provide nurse-led triage. The health Minister, John Hill MP, has denied that there is any threat to close Burra Hospital. Local pharmacist, John Barton has described the two local doctors as ‘caring professionals’ who put a lot of effort and concern into daily practice. He offered them his moral support.</p>

<p>Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes deploring the loss of emergency services at Burra Hospital and fearing that without a local doctor’s presence many will bypass the facility and go somewhere else. And if few people use it the next step could be loss of the facility.</p>
<p>Evan Hawke also writes expressing concern at the downgrading of the service to be provided locally at the Burra Hospital.</p>
<p>Lisa Smedley also writes to express her outrage at the decision on the Burra Hospital emergency service. Clare doctors are already fully extended coping with local demand there. It can take days to get to see a doctor in Clare. There is also a domino effect. What doctor would want to practice in Burra without hospital privileges? How long will the town have a pharmacist if there is no local doctor and hospital? This decision could have a huge effect throughout the town and community, with the loss of many associated jobs and knock-on effects socially and economically. People have been comfortable moving to the town because it had a doctor, hospital and pharmacy. An extra half an hour in an emergency before you get a medical decision from someone could mean your life.</p>

<p>Burra Mine is edging closer to World Heritage listing. Last week Burra was visited by representatives of the Cornish Mining World Heritage administration: Co-ordinator Deborah Boden and Cornish Baird Terry Johnson. Both Burra &amp; Moonta sites are already State heritage listed and are being considered for short-listing for National Heritage listing. World Heritage status was granted to Cornwall and West Devon sites in 2006. A successful bid would have considerable economic benefits for the area.</p>

<p>Hallett Wind Farm Lights have been turned off. After Federal MP for Grey, Rowan Ramsey, called for a review, the red flashing lights on the wind farms in the Hallett area have been turned off. Advice to AGL, who own the cluster of wind farms in the Hallett area, was that since the towers are below the lowest permissible aviation height, they do not have to be lit. The intrusive lighting has now been turned off.</p>

<p>Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes concerning the closing of emergency services at Burra Hospital.</p>
<p>Despite Country Health SA’s assurance that nothing has changed, it is clear that the absence of an on site doctor is a definite change. Apart from the needs of local residents there are at least four other major concerns:</p>
<p>Thousands of tourists travel through the town and district. Does this make a litigation case possible if emergency services are not available?</p>
<p>Burra has the only hospital on the Barrier Highway between Riverton and Peterborough. It is a stretch notorious for the number of accidents it hosts.</p>
<p>The Burra Hospital is vital to the residents of the vast sparsely settled pastoral area to the east.</p>
<p>Increasing wind farm and mining activity in the district is exposing more people to potentially hazardous situations in the work place.</p>
<p>Country Health SA Hospital Inc released last week a draft copy of its 10 year Local Health Service Plan for the Lower North. Respondents to surveys clearly said they did not want to lose facilities they had and that an emergency service was identified by 65% or respondents as a basic and minimum service required locally. A delegation of concerned citizens met with the CEO of Goyder Council on Tuesday and it is hoped some answers and an understanding of the issues involved will follow.</p>
<p>Peter Brodie writes to query how the extra costs in getting Clare doctors to attend Burra emergencies will be met. Will they be a charge against Burra Hospital? And will that increased cost be a factor in determining the viability of maintaining the hospital?</p>
<p>Dr Peter Stanley of Canberra writes seeking help from German-Australian families called Schmidt with respect to the family experiences of the Great War 1914-18.</p>

<p>Mt Bryan Progress Association has managed the extraordinary feat of raising $30,000 in 6 months to enable the purchase of a community tractor and ride-on lawnmower. Fundraising efforts realised $5,600. The regional Council of Goyder provided $3,000 through the Capital Fund, $5,000 through the Sport &amp; Recreation Fund and $3,000 from Ward Funds. AGL gave a Community Fund Grant of $7,500. Donations from around the district raised the rest. The ride-on mower received funding from the Dept. of Families, Housing, Community Service and Indigenous Affairs with a grant of $2,990. The tractor will be ‘put to good use maintaining grasses and other potential hazards’. [Perhaps reducing other hazards?] The Progress Association has done much for the small town since 1992. The old railway yards have been beautified. Toilets have been erected. There is a new fire shed and the radio tower was transferred. A sheltered barbecue area was formed with a gazebo with seating, mini golf and the planting of hundreds of plants. Playground equipment from the former school was transferred to the roadside area after the school closed in 2001. The area is used by locals for community events as well as by passing travellers. There are plans for the development of the East Terrace ‘meeting house’, which was formerly the Mt Bryan Tennis Club. It was repaired late in 2009 and is used for association meetings. A shed has been erected to house equipment and it is intended to rehabilitate the tennis courts and mark them for multi-purpose use. It is intended to create a recreation area there away from the highway for local children to use. The small group of 11 people currently can be proud of its achievements.</p>

<p>Burra Quilters report by President Maureen Fuss.</p>
<p>The year began with much work towards the exhibition in May, finishing off quilts from workshops in 2008 and making blocks for the quilt to be raffled at the exhibition. A group visited three quilt exhibitions in the Barossa during the Vintage festival. The exhibition in May was a great success. The People’s Choice award went to Pauline Miller again and everyone was shocked and saddened by her unexpected death in February 2010. In May we received a cheque for $4,500 from the principal of the local school, who had applied for a community grant on our behalf, to further our involvement in supporting local charities. A retreat to Camp Willochra at Melrose was another enjoyable weekend at the end of May. A wonderful Christmas dinner at the home of Judy and David Miller concluded the year. Funds from the raffled quilt at the exhibition went to the Motor Neurone Disease Organisation.</p>
<p>The Burra Quilters Group is a very active organisation with members from Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Farrell Flat, Clare and Sturtvale Station. As well as making quilts for their own pleasure, they make quilts for charity. One recently completed for the Burra Hospital Auxiliary will be raffled at the 2010 Melbourne Cup Luncheon. Today they group is hosting the Biggest Quilting Bee with proceeds going to the Cancer Council in conjunction with the Biggest Morning Tea.</p>

<p>New Kerbside Collection System</p>
<p>The state governments move to reduce the number of landfill sites and encourage recycling will soon see the closure of local rubbish sites in the district. The Goyder Council will introduce an additional bin to allow for recyclable material to be collected fortnightly. The service charge for rubbish collection will increase from $90 to $158 p.a. This compares with $160 for Clare and $130 for the Wakefield Regional Council (which is closer to the landfill site). All seven landfill sites in the Council area will be closed and capped and transfer stations will be established at Burra, Eudunda and Hallett. The household waste will be collected weekly in the new red top 140-litre bin and the larger bin currently in use will become the recycle bin. The new bin will be delivered (without charge) in mid-June.</p>

<p>AGL’s Hallett 2 Wind Farm was opened on Saturday by the Premier Mike Rann with about 160 people attending on a very cold and windy occasion. Hallett 2 has been generating since last year. Mr Rann said more than $2 billion had now been invested in wind farms, which by the end of the year will contribute 1000 MW to the power grid. This places SA ahead of its target to have 20% of its electricity powered from renewable sources by 2014 and on target for 33% by 2020. He said wind farms were good for the environment and generated jobs and economic activity in regional communities. AGL managing director said community support was a key factor for successful wind farm development. He estimated that more than $2 million had been injected into the local economy and some 200 local people had worked on the project’s construction. All service technicians at Hallett 1 &amp; 2 are locals he said. Lasting benefits to the community would also come from the community funds established for each wind farm project.</p>

<p>Wind Farm Protestors also attended the opening of Hallett 2. Four opponents of further wind farms in the Mid North were on hand to make their opposition known: Dennis Dale &amp; Liz Traeger of Yacka, with Bob Lamb &amp; Ally Fricker of Brady Creek. They held large placards decrying the loss of visual amenity and claiming that wind farms ruin lives.</p>
<p>Burra Hospital. A group of local residents met the Premier Mike Rann at White cedars Café in Burra before the opening of Hallett 2 Wind Farm. They queried the implications of the recently announced Federal Government funding arrangements and whether they would mean that the abandoned Country health Plan would be returning. They also wanted the reinstatement of an attending Burra doctor for the assessment and or treatment of emergency cases at the Burra Hospital. They sought the Premier’s assistance in organising a public meeting at Burra Town Hall, Attended by the Health Minister, John Hill. Helen Szuty said the group got a good hearing in a meeting of more than half an hour. The Premier said the abandoned Country health Plan was definitely not back on the agenda.</p>
<p>Paxton Square Cottages</p>
<p>The Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee has recommended the new Council Committee to manage the cottages be known as the Lewis Board and Council has adopted this recommendation. In 1913 the Hon. John Lewis bought the cottages at auction from the South Australian Mining Assoc. and formed the Lewis Trust to administer the leasing of the cottages to indigent and deserving people. The trust was incorporated before his death in 1923. A Parliamentary Bill in 1980 enabled the cottages to be vested in the District Council of Burra Burra. The Lewis Trust then became the Lewis Board of Management with Cr Andrew Gebhardt as Chairman. Thirty years on the name will continue. Council is now calling for applications from residents for positions on the seven member board.</p>

<p>Last Tuesday Country Health SA Yorke &amp; Lower North Services Director Gary Stewart met with concerned residents over the issue of having a resident doctor in Burra to attend emergencies. Helen Szuty said they had heard that Dr Dharma Dissanayake’s appeal about the current arrangements had been heard, but the results had not been made known. Mr Stewart reassured the group that in the meantime critically ill patients will be attended to by ambulance officers and/or triage registered nurses available all the time and doctors based in Clare would immediately be called in. Ms Szuty said that while the ongoing processes seem to have been fair to the doctor concerned, the length of the process has meant that Burra and District have not had the benefit of the usual and expected level of emergency services.</p>

<p>Accident. Police and emergency services attended an accident last Sunday night at the intersection of the Barrier Highway and Copperhouse road southwest of Burra. It is alleged that a Holden sedan with two passengers failed to give way at the intersection and collided with a four-wheel drive with three occupants. The 4WD rolled several times and passengers in the Holden had to be cut from the vehicle and were taken to Clare by ambulance. A female passenger was seriously injured and was air lifted to Adelaide. A dog with seven pups was thrown from the Holden and two of the pups had to be destroyed due to their injuries.</p>
<p>Accident. A car seems to have run into the jinker shed in Market Street with some violence on Thursday. The structure housing the historic vehicle was extensively damaged and the jinker was moved out of position.</p>

<p>Phoenix Copper Exploration is causing some unease with their proposed exploration within the Burra Mine Reserve. The proposed exploration will include the Burra Mines Historic site and the Burra Smelter site1, which are the centre of the township. Concerns are centred around the removal or lifting of the Heritage status2, which was put in place to protect the site from mining. Another concern, which has been highlighted by local stakeholders is the hydrology of the region, with fears that the pit of the Monster Mine would be de-watered.3 Last week the managing director of Phoenix Copper, Paul Dowd, met with representative of various committees in Burra, including the Regional Council of Goyder, National Trust and heritage Advisor Douglas Alexander, in a discussion of the proposed exploration and the company’s aspirations. News of the exploration has been slowly trickling through to the community, with many residents unsure of exactly what is proposed. National Trust representative Paul Marsson circulated an open letter last week outlining concerns with the proposal, which echo the concerns of many Burra residents. Specifically the concerns are that the exploration is proposed for the Mine Reserve, which holds Heritage status and which lies in the centre of the town. Mr Dowd has responded to the open letter to the Mid North Broadcaster (see page 2) stating the company’s intentions and refuting Mr Marsson’s assertions. He says the company intends to work closely with stakeholders and leave little or no footprint. He believes the prospect of mining would enhance Burra’s tourism with the modern offering comparison with the untouched heritage mining sites adjacent. The Regional Council of Goyder has requested an open forum to be attended by Mr Dowd and the interested public and a meeting has been arranged in the Burra Town Hall 5 July at 7.30 p.m.</p>
<p>[1 Mr Dowd specifically ruled out any interest in the Smelts area, though a lifting of the reserve would presumably apply to that part of the reserve as well, unless it were specifically excluded from the changed status.</p>
<p>2 The lifting of the reserve under the Mining Act could permit exploration if the Minister so decided, but it would not in itself change the heritage status.</p>
<p>3 This was also specifically addressed by Mr Dowd. He assured the meeting of 16 June that dewatering the mine was not necessary for exploration and would be prohibitively expensive for that purpose. See also his letter on page 2 of this issue.]</p>

<p>Burra Doctors Missing</p>
<p>Dr Dharma Dissanayake &amp; her husband Dr Lakman Fernando went to Sri Lanka for a holiday three weeks ago and were due back on 21 June. They have not been heard from since they left their hotel en route for the airport to fly home more than two weeks ago. Family and colleagues’ concerns have been heightened by an unconfirmed report that Dr Fernando has been hospitalised in a medical centre on Colombo. The lack of communication is uncharacteristic, as business associate and friend Lorna Robb of Melbourne said she usually heard from them daily. The couple have been declared missing persons by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs. The other problem created by their disappearance is that any locum coming to the Burra practice would not have authorisation to access patient files. Ms Robb, as the couple’s emergency contact person and their accountant Bruno Batistella have been working on this problem as well as trying to establish the whereabouts and situation of the doctors. Because the Burra practice is privately owned Country health SA has no authorisation to step in.</p>

<p>Paul Dowd, Managing Director of Phoenix Copper Ltd, writes in response to the open letter circulated by Paul Marsson.</p>
<p>I had hoped that the meeting with stakeholders on 16 June would have clarified the company’s position and allayed some of the ungrounded fears. It was therefore unfortunate that the open letter was circulated on that very day, as it contains several factually incorrect statements.</p>
<p>It is asserted that the intention is remove the water from the mine pit. This would be expensive and unnecessary for exploration. Should exploration be successful and should future development require the removal of the water Phoenix Copper is aware that an appropriate water management plan would have to be developed.</p>
<p>It is asserted that it would necessitate the destruction of Heritage-listed mine buildings. This would be an act of delinquency beyond any reasonable person’s contemplation. In any case there are relevant authorities who would not stand by and allow such a heinous act to occur.</p>
<p>There are other incorrect statements, but I would rather engage in a constructive dialogue. Such a dialogue would further promote the wonderful Heritage of the Burra area. Phoenix Copper supports the World Heritage Listing. An Exploration Licence does not permit mining.</p>
<p>Other State and Federal regulations already in place regulate activities and standards within the area even if the ‘reserve’ was lifted.</p>
<p>[Mr Dowd goes on to recount his heritage credentials and to promote his view that modern mining could be done in such a way as to promote the heritage of the area and its tourism.]</p>
<p>Mr Matt Reilly writes in support of exploring for copper in the Burra Mine reserve.</p>
<p>At the peak of mining operations at the Burra Mine it gave SA such an economic boost that it was a major factor in saving SA from bankruptcy. And this was from a relatively shallow mine with a maximum depth of 600 ft compared with 3,000 ft at Wallaroo. In 1851 Burra was the largest inland centre in Australia with a population of about 5,000 people.</p>
<p>At one stage Burra had five hairdressers, four chemists, 17 hotels1, surgeons and a host of other flourishing businesses. Were it not for Norm Foster, who crossed the floor of Parliament, Roxby Downs may still be waiting for approval, denying SA billions of dollars in earnings. There is nothing to say Burra can’t be as successful. Without productive industry in Burra it will continue to decline, young people will leave for employment and businesses and services will be extinguished. As a third generation Burra resident, I am proud of our heritage, but it should be balanced with future opportunities.</p>
<p>[1 This is often asserted, or at least a similar figure is claimed. In fact there have been 17 hotels in the town, if Copperhouse is included, but they did not operate simultaneously. The greatest number at any one time would seem to have been between 1859 and 1866, when there were 10 and one of those was at Copperhouse. From 1854 to 1858 there were 8, though not the same 8 for all those years. There have been 5 since 1921.]</p>
<p>Steve Royal writes in response to the public meeting arranged by the Regional Council of Goyder for 5 July.</p>
<p>In the near future there will be many perceived benefits presented to the residents of Burra and the Mid-North. Please remember on thing. Phoenix Copper Ltd exists for the benefit of Phoenix Copper Ltd. It does not exist to benefit Burra, its heritage, residents, its water catchment, groundwater, the State of SA or the environment.</p>
<p>I urge anybody who is concerned about the Phoenix Copper proposal, which may lead to exploration (and subsequent mining) in a Heritage area and in the middle of a town, to come to this meeting.</p>
<p>It is essential to the future of Burra that Phoenix is not allowed to get their wish to remove the Reserve protection on the Monster Mine, and that exploration/mining in the Burra State Heritage area is also not allowed.</p>
<p>Jim Dunstan of the Mid North Wind Farm Group writes continuing the argument against wind farm development in populated area. He considers that regardless of their efficiency or their good or bad effect on the environment, it is an unnecessary gamble with out health and well-being. Once in place they will not be removed and yet we may find in a year’s time they are detrimental. Australia is a big place and their location in populated areas is the issue.</p>
<p>Mrs J. Button of Booborowie writes urging the Council to keep the local dump open. She fears the alternative will lead to increased dumping in creeks, waterways and along roads.</p>
<p>Ken Bruce of Booborowie travelled to North Tuppal Station between Deniliquin and Tocumwal for a blade shearing event in June. He took part in the event where 72 rams were blade shorn in a recreation of the Tom Roberts’ painting ‘The Shearing of the Rams’.</p>

<p>The Lewis Board</p>
<p>An information evening at the Burra Town Hall on Wednesday night brought out a good cross-section of the community to learn about the progress of Paxton Square management. The proposed Board will take over the role of the existing Paxton Square Cottages Operations Committee. About 35 people attended the meeting chaired by Mayor Peter Mattey and attended by John Brak (Goyder CEO) and Councillors Reilly, Bradley, Mosey and Gill. Council took over direct control of the cottages in September 2008 and employed Juanita Queissner as manager. The Operations Committee was also set up. Membership of the new board will comprise seven representatives and one elected member of the Regional Council of Goyder. While representatives from the Burra area are favoured anyone living within the Council area may apply. Another person may be recommended by the committee and approved by Council. Members would be appointed for three years and would manage, operate and maintain the cottages on behalf of the Council.</p>
<p>Goyder Council discussed the application by Phoenix Copper to have the Burra Mine Reserve lifted and reports on the proposal made by the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee, at their meeting on 22 June. The diversity of opinion from the elected members led to the decision to gauge public opinion before making a submission to PIRSA on the matter. This will be done at a meeting to be held on 5 July at the Burra Town Hall.</p>
<p>PIRSA has extended invitations to stakeholders to make submissions on the proposal by Phoenix Copper Ltd to lift the Burra Monster Mine Reserve. The area was reserved from the operative provisions of the Mining Act 1971 on 10 March 1988 to provide protection to the historic mining heritage and currently precludes any access for mineral exploration or mining within the reserve. Following this consultation a recommendation will be prepared for the Minister for Mineral Resources Development on whether the Reserve should be varied to allow the granting of an Exploration licence. The Phoenix Copper proposal can be downloaded from the web. Submissions must reach the Mining Registrar, Minerals and Energy Resources Division, PIRSA, GPO Box 1671, Adelaide or email junesse.martin@ sa.gov.au by 8 July, 2010.</p>

<p>Phoenix Exploration Proposal, Public Information Forum, Burra Town Hall, Monday night.</p>
<p>The meeting was held to discuss the proposal by Phoenix Copper Ltd to list the Reserve on the Monster Mine Reserve to enable mineral exploration in the area.</p>
<p>The Town Hall meeting drew about 200 people to hear about the proposal from Phoenix Copper Ltd Managing Director Paul Dowd and to gauge public opinion in Burra.</p>
<p>Among the audience were Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP and Mark Parnell MLC and Shadow Minister for Environment and Conservation Michelle Lensink.</p>
<p>Mayor Peter Mattey chaired the meeting, which was to gauge public opinion before Council made its submission to PIRSA on the matter.</p>
<p>Phoenix Copper’s Managing Director Paul Dowd and chief geologist Mark Manly presented a slide show of the company’s proposal, outlining where they hoped to explore and how they would go about it. Questions were repeatedly asked about what would happen if significant copper discoveries led to mining development. Some people were strongly opposed to the proposition and others were clearly excited by the development prospects it offered. Former PIRSA senior geologist and author spoke for the National Trust and expressed his belief that successful exploration would inevitably be followed by mining and that could not but damage Burra’s heritage, the chances of World Heritage listing and tourism. The Burra History Group also voiced its opposition in the cause of preserving the town’s authentic heritage. A local landowner expressed the concerns of a number of people about the effect of mining on the water table and the users of bores in the area. Mr Dowd said there was no intention to dewater the mine for exploration and before any mining a detailed water management plan would be implemented. He also again assured people that the preservation of mining heritage was paramount. The initial testing program would involve five test holes and take about three months. If the results were unsuccessful they would have to reconsider any further activity, but if the initial results were promising then testing 300 m beneath the mine would follow and that could take up to two years. Mark Parnell (Greens) MLC spoke for the Ratepayers Action Group and said only 5% of the state was closed to mineral exploration and mining and amendments to the Mining Act were being debated next week and they would consider special places to be off limits to mining. Maybe Burra needs to be on that list. Other people spoke up in the almost three hours of discussion and many expressed the need for progress, growth and economic development to keep the town alive and provide employment. A show of hands at the end of the night indicated a 60/40 split with 60% in favour of the exploration proposal.</p>

<p>Peter Edson writes as President of BRTBA</p>
<p>‘Bugger Heritage’ and some rather pessimistic views that Burra was declining and that tourism was of little benefit to the town were some of the more depressing comments from Monday’s community meeting. In the past 30 years many country towns have had is tough and suffered a declining population. Burra has held up very well and this is largely due to the citizens in the 60s and 70s who saw that Burra’s heritage could promote tourism. At the centre of this was its Cornish mining heritage and the Burra Mine Reserve established in 1988. Burra is now being considered for World Heritage listing, which has huge potential for the future. Over 25,000 visitors pass through the Visitor Centre and over 12,000 purchase the Passport Key to demonstrate its marketability. Visitors bring dollars into the town. Many local businesses would not survive without this influx. A publican has stated that 80% of meals are served to visitors. Antique stores, coffee shops, restaurants, service stations and banks would not be here but for visitors. It is part of the SA Government’s Strategic Plan to increase visitor numbers and lengthen their stay. Exploration and mining outside of Burra may indeed bring benefits to the town, but let us not sacrifice the long term prosperity of our town for what is likely to be short term gain. And let us not forget that Phoenix Copper’s main interests are its shareholders. Please let us not disparage the value of heritage and tourism in Burra.</p>

<p>Burra Sale Yards have been sold, marking the end of an era. Sheep numbers have decline form more than 200 million in the 1970s when the saleyards were built to about 70 million today. This has contributed to the drop in the number of smaller rural markets and the concentration on larger regional markets, such as at Jamestown in the Mid North. Clients of Elders have been going to Jamestown for the past five to eight years and there have been no sales in Burra since October 2007, and that was only a small affair in the morning before a Jamestown sale. At the peak Burra had monthly markets except in January and at times there were two a month. There was a time when the Burra market attracted buyers from all over the state and from Victoria. In the 1970s and 1980s everyone had lambs and sold them at the local market. Young and older ewes were sold in October and wethers and lambs in November. The largest number of sheep yarded at the Burra sale yards was for the Elders Centenary on Wednesday 25 November 1987, which was about 25,000. Dressed in period costume Tom Rogers, who was State Livestock Manager for Elders. He auctioned the first lot in pound shillings and pence.</p>

<p>[Note. This article is misleading in some of its statements. It is true that the saleyards in their latest configuration date from 1972, but Elders saleyards on this site were much older, as the reference to Elders Centenary Sale suggests. The story of sheep sales at Burra North is complicated by the variety of agents and companies involved, but the Elders’ story starts on the site with their new yards being used for the first time on 25 November 1887, when they had a yarding of 25,000 sheep and 300 cattle. The following year Elders Wool and Produce Co. was reorganised as Elder, Smith &amp; Co. and the first sale under this name was on 27 July 1888 with just 4,350 sheep and 15 cattle. In 1891 Sara &amp; Dunstan completely reconstructed the saleyards for Elders and the new yards were opened 15 October 1891 with a yarding of 25,174 sheep. In the late 1880s and early 1890s Elders were yarding over 200,000 sheep a year. Shakes &amp; Lewis were handling almost as many and others somewhat fewer, but an annual turnover in excess of half a million sheep was being recorded. A series of dry years from 1892 saw numbers plummet, but the peak sale in SA was recorded on 27 September 1895 when Elders at their Bon Accord sale yarded 44,000 sheep and sold 36,000 of them along with 750 head of cattle. In 1972 the old timber yards were replaced with the metal fencing that has just been sold.</p>

<p>The International Council on Monuments and Sites has entered the debate over the lifting of the Burra Mine Reserve. ICOMOS has made a submission to PIRSA saying that Burra is currently under consideration for nomination as a World heritage Site and in 1979 Burra was the location of the proclamation of the Australia ICOMOS Burra Charter, which provides guidance for the conservation and management of places of cultural significance. It says the proposal by Phoenix must be measured against its impact upon the State Heritage listed values of the site and its potential World Heritage values along with the preparation of a Conservation Management Plan.</p>
<p>Burra Red Cross reports on another successful year in which $4,988 was forwarded to headquarters. In the year two members received 10 year badges, and there were also awards of a 20 year, a 40 year a 60 year and a 70 year badge.</p>
<p>Shadow Minister for Tourism, Terry Stephens was in Burra with Dan van Holst Pellekaan on Tuesday as they followed up the question of Phoenix Copper’s application to lift the Mine Reserve. The local member’s view is ‘that rather than say “no”, the community should put the challenge to the company and state their conditions, which could potentially benefit both parties.</p>

<p>The Burra Mine Site</p>
<p>Goyder Council has sent a lengthy submission to PIRSA in response to Phoenix Copper’s application to lift the Burra Mine Reserve. Council considered the reports prepared by Golder Associates on behalf of Phoenix Copper, by the Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee and its own Heritage Advisor. It took into account opinions expressed by key community groups in the district and at the Public Information Meeting by both Phoenix and the public. Council’s discussion on 22 June 2010 proved to be inconclusive, with no resolution being reached. The public meeting saw widely divergent views expressed, but about 60% of those present supported allowing the exploration in the reserve. As a result the Council has adopted the view that exploration will determine the existence or otherwise of untapped mineral reserves, after which the potential for economic stimulus for the Burra community from mining can be determined.</p>
<p>However, in view of community concerns the Council has also asked that a series of strict criteria be met to protect heritage vales and structures:</p>
<p>The reserve be lifted only for the mine site [– not the smelts section of the reserve.]</p>
<p>That the lifting be for no more than two years and it then be reimposed.</p>
<p>That the Exploration Licence, once awarded not be transferable to any other party.</p>
<p>A Conservation Management Plan be prepared prior to exploration, by a suitable expert with recommendations for appropriate cartilage* [sic] to guide, inform and limit exploration and mining activities. The plan to be adopted only after appropriate community consultation by the Department of Environment and Heritage.</p>
<p>[* The Council used the obscure word ‘curtilage’ – a mediaeval term for an enclosed area around a house etc.]</p>
<p>An Archaeological Investigation of the area to be explored to form fart of the Conservation Management Plan.</p>
<p>A detailed Hydrological Impact Study be prepared and its impacts understood before exploration commencing.</p>
<p>Details of locations of drill holes be provided to Council and approved before exploration commences.</p>
<p>Details of [the impact of ] noise and vibrations on residents, the stability of the open cut, the town and historical structures be provided, understood and approved by Council prior to exploration.</p>
<p>A Visual Impact Statement be provided and approved by Council prior to exploration.</p>
<p>Council provided the submission on behalf of the Goyder community generally and the Burra community in particular as well as in its capacity as the owner of the greater part of the reserve.</p>

<p>The Burra Mine Site</p>
<p>Ratepayers’ Action Group has also lodged a submission with PIRSA on the Phoenix application to lift the Burra Mine Reserve.</p>
<p>The submission begins with an outline of RAG’s objectives and some of the issues it has addressed in the past. RAG is concerned that the minutes on the Council on 22 January 2008 show that Mr Dowd of Phoenix addressed Council on the intentions of the company for mining in the Burra region, but no other information is given, neither has there been any media coverage from then till a public notice in the Mid North Broadcaster in May 2010. Much space is then devoted to a critique of the public meeting [of 5 July 2010]. The conclusion is that despite contrary views in the community RAG is opposed to the lifting of the reserve and that many residents are largely ignorant of Burra’s history and heritage and its importance to the town. RAG blames the Council for doing little to emphasize the economic benefits of tourism to the community and the international importance of ‘The Burra Charter’. If an exploration licence is granted the company should expect ‘a watchful community during the exploration phase and a helluva fight should a mining licence be subsequently sought’.</p>

<p>The Underwater Training Centre SA (UTCSA) has sent a submission to PIRSA on the Phoenix Mining proposal to conduct mineral exploration in the Burra Mine Reserve.</p>
<p>UTCSA is a major stakeholder and is totally dependent on the enclosed body of water in the Mine Pool. Director Martin Phillips said they had been operating in Burra for the past ten years. Dewatering of the mine area would mean a complete closure of the facility. The school is on of only three commercial accredited occupational diver training organisations on the Australian mainland. They maintain an ongoing supply of certified divers for the State’s aquaculture sector. It arose when accident rates from recreationally trained divers caused WorkCover costs to rise. Port Lincoln was initially chosen as the site, but a variety of problems, including sharks, prompted the move to an inland body of water with a more predictable and controlled environment. There were two suitable sites in SA, but the other, Mt Gambier’s Blue Lake, was controlled by SA Water and was unavailable. Property in Port Lincoln was sold and the move to Burra was made at considerable expense. In recent times a process of infrastructure expansion has been undertaken, which would be largely complete within twelve months. If the reserve status of the area were to be lifted their expansion plans would immediately have to be stopped. They were poised to become an export industry with the potential to continue for many years. The provision of services to international students has begun and is likely to grow. The centre co-exists very well with the heritage aspects of the mine site. UTCSA has observed widely fluctuating water levels, especially in summer, which suggests the aquifer is under stress and this would have implications for surrounding water users in the event of the dewatering of the pool.</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station has received a $220,000 grant to begin the restoration and redevelopment of the site. The handover of the money was announced by the State Environment and Conservation Minister Paul Caica. The intention was to develop the building as a palaeontology and archaeology museum to showcase fossil remains of the mega fauna discovered at the Redbanks Conservation Park, east of Burra. A research and educational centre to promote local Ngadjuri culture would also be established at the site. The whole project would cost $1 million. Pip Edson, as spokesperson for the ‘Save the Railway Station Group’ said that although this was the tip of the iceberg in terms of the work needed to realise the project, it was exciting to finally be able to begin the restoration. Much work is to be done and it will involve volunteers as well as skilled tradespersons. The restoration will directly employ 12 skilled contractors and 4 trainees over some 9 months. Volunteer Roy Taplin will manage the project. He was at the station early on Friday to clear broken glass and other debris as a result of a vandal attack overnight. After visiting the station Mr Caica met other interested persons for morning tea at the Burra Regional Art Gallery. The heritage listed Station building was erected in 1883 and replaced a wood and iron structure built for the arrival of the line in 1870. The Burra services were discontinued in 1985 and the line closed in 1988.</p>

<p>Burra Classic Cycling Race will be held next Saturday. The event will be the 90th Megafert Burra Cycling Classic. It began as an annual event in 1907, but there was no racing during the war years and also for a brief period in the mid-1950s. The first race went from Burra to Adelaide, finishing in King William Street at the City Baths, where the Festival Theatre is now located. The starting point for races later alternated between Adelaide and Burra. As Adelaide grew the finishes were pushed further into the northern suburbs until the mid 1980s. More recently the courses have been a variety of country routes. This year the race is from Burra to Mt Bryan and then to Robertstown via Burra and back to Burra for a distance of 125 km.</p>

<p>Burra Creek beautification works have begun. A plan has been adopted and contractors are planting and trimming trees. The Kingston Street Bridge has been painted and repaired. The next stage will see work on the section south of the bridge. Dead reed beds will be removed by burning. The weir near the dugouts will be removed to allow better access for future maintenance and planting of trees and ground covers will follow. The area just north of the bridge will be upgraded in the next two years with landscaping, walkways and picnic areas. The water level in this section will be maintained at its present level but there will not be permanent water beyond the present control weir [at Ursula St.]</p>

<p>Burra’s Doctor Problems</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Action Group is calling for an independent inquiry into the removal of Dr Dharma Dissanayake’s attendance at emergencies at the Burra Hospital. They understand that after a number of complaints a hearing was held and the privileges were withdrawn. The matter was discussed with Premier Rann when he visited on 29 May. Dr Dharma has appealed the decision and an appeal hearing has been held, but the outcome is still not known. An extension of time until August 23 has been granted. In the meantime triage services are in place for people requiring medical assistance at Burra Hospital with arrangements for a transferral to Clare Hospital if necessary. The group is calling for an independent inquiry should no satisfactory resolution result from the meeting of 23 August.</p>

<p>BRTBA is facing a challenging year according to President Peter Edson. The possibility of holding major events is well worth considering. He said BRTBA’s most significant role was the management of the Burra Visitor Centre, which last year has 28,000 visitors through its doors and booked $260,000 worth of accommodation. The BVC’s facilities are clearly quite inadequate compared with those in other centres. A challenge for this year is therefore the updating or relocation of the Visitor Centre. In the event that Phoenix Copper was granted exploration rights in the Mine area BRTBA would have to work closely with it to ensure the community and tourism benefited from the activity. Road signage on roads leading to the town was another issue. He reminded people that it was not necessary to own a business to become involved with BRTBA, anyone with ideas, visions and energy were most welcome to attend the AGM, scheduled for Tuesday 31 August.</p>

<p>Burra Tennis Club faces an uncertain future due to dwindling numbers. The club has gone from fielding six senior teams to one. The club has been a strong contender in the Burra &amp; District Tennis Association, which includes Booborowie, Hallett, Spalding and Andrews Tennis Clubs. The declining interest saw the folding of the Farrell Flat Club this season. President Travis Thamm said the junior numbers are quite healthy, it is difficult to find senior player. This season it proved hard to get one senior team together. The fear is that the whole association would fold if Burra cannot get sufficient members.</p>
<p>Burra Community School Students and those from Robertstown School planted 152 trees at Worlds End section of the Burra Creek Gorge earlier this month. It was part of a project by the Native Vegetation Council to revegetate the south side of the creek adjacent to the camping ground. The Burra Creek is a biodiversity hot spot and the creek forms an important habitat corridor between two large sections of remnant vegetation in the Burra District. Among the many species living there is the diamond fire-tail finch, which is listed as vulnerable. The project is funded by an NVC grant of $100,000 and is managed by the Regional Council of Goyder and the SA MDB NRM Board.</p>

<p>Grassy Woodlands need to be recognised for their importance as a home to a host of threatened species. SA MDB NRM Board spokesperson Sarah Lance said their importance can often be overlooked as they blend in with surrounding pasture and crops. They contain unusual plants and a wide range of wildlife reliant on these threatened ecosystems. She was speaking on National Threatened Species Day yesterday. Two such threatened habitats are Iron-grass Temperate Grasslands and Peppermint Box Grassy Woodlands. Many species are found only in grassy ecosystems. Among endangered animal species are the pygmy blue-tongue lizard and the plains wanderer an endangered and elusive seed eating bird. Most of the areas of these ecosystems occur on private land and the SA MDB NRM Board is running a new Environmental Stewardship project to fund private land managers to protect and improve these ecosystems. People with these two ecosystems on their property are invited to participate in the project.</p>

<p>Burra Show was held last weekend in ideal weather. The attendance was good and the feedback from locals was positive. MP Dan van Holst Pellekaan and his wife attended, as did Rowan Ramsey later in the day. There were about 40 trade sites and the sideshows were popular as usual. Entries were generally pleasing, though down in the ute competition. There were 13 competitors in the shearing competition. Life Member Ron Shipard officially opened the event. President John Oates said it was very pleasing to see the turnaround from a few years ago when the show appeared to be struggling. ‘Horses in Action’ is a booming section, with greater numbers this year allowing for a full events card. Charles McInnis of Mt Bryan deserves special mention for entering a wide field of sections and taking out the Junior Aggregate Award.</p>

<p>The Burra Hospital Petition is drawing widespread support. It was drafted by members of the Ratepayers Action Group with the help of the Office of Greens MLC Mark Parnell. Many hundreds of people have already signed the petition, which seeks a solution to problems caused by the withdrawal of the emergency service attending rights of Burra doctor Dharma Dissanayake. While Country Health SA contends that emergency services are unchanged, with doctors attending from Clare as required, Dr Lakman Fernando disagrees. He is Dr Dissanayake’s husband and also works part of the time at Burra. He says there is confusion at the hospital over emergency procedures, with reluctance by the staff there to call the on-call Clare doctor. He believes that the nurses at the hospital are acting as if there is no emergency service going on there.</p>

<p>Burra Early Learning Centre</p>
<p>Director Brenda Villis is stepping down after more than 15 years at the helm. Mrs Villis (referred to by many of the children as Mrs Billis) started working at the centre in Term 2 1994, after almost two decades in primary education. She became Director at the start of 1995. Mrs Villis says she has had the honour of teaching many wonderful children in her time there and marvels at the uniqueness of each of them. She has been a key instigator in many fund raising efforts over the years, which have resulted in many improvements. Major changes have included the replacement of the drab brown Hessian ceiling and brown beams with a white ceiling and pale blue beams, the occasional care room, the mesh fencing, the safety gates, storage sheds, bike track, landscaping, cubby house and shade cloth. An impressive array of educational resources has also been acquired. Sheree Mader will take over as Director. [Photo of Brenda Villis, Sheree Mader and the children.]</p>
<p>Changes under way at the Early Learning Centre include extensions to the Occasional Care Room to introduce baby changing facilities, fencing and a safety gate for the kitchen area. In the meantime the centre is operating from the Burra Sports Complex.</p>

<p>John Barton, Burra Chemist for more than 30 years, has decided to retire. John bought the business from Murray Odgers, who had been chemist in the town for 32 years. John arrived in Burra with his family on 1 August 1977 with his wife Von and three young children. They also opened the adjacent shop as Open House Gift Shop. When he arrived the local doctor was Les Miller and over the years he has seen Rob Oswald, Ashley Thomas, Peter Davies and Tim Simpson come and go. Sadly Yvonne died several years ago and John will now buy a house in Adelaide and catch up with friends and family there. John attributed much of the smooth running of the business to his staff, who he says have been tremendous over the years. He is confidant that the business will evolve under his successor Tim Siv of Clare.</p>

<p>Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard Project</p>
<p>Nature Foundation SA purchased 85 hectares of native grassland on July this year to provide habitat for this endangered species – thought to be extinct as recently as 1992. The area comprised a section of the property known as ‘Wandillah’. The new property will be known as ‘Teliqua’ from the generic name for the species: Teliqua adelaidensis. An event this weekend will launch the new location and conservation and management arrangements. Another ceremony will see the handing over of the title to a BushbankSA property Read Creek Hills (formerly known as Halleluja Hills) to the local conservation group, World’s End Conservation Pty Ltd. This property is an outstanding remnant of native vegetation of the northern Mt Lofty Ranges landscape.</p>

<p>Weather. The Mid North was rocked by record breaking rains last week with spectacular lightning displays, flooding rains, high winds and hail. Much of the trouble that saw SES crews so busy was due to the suddenness with which the storm front moved across the region. Gutters were simply unable to cope with the downpour and local drains were similarly overwhelmed. The Burra Creek flowed strongly. Some people said it was the strongest flow in more than twenty years. Debris was strewn across roads and a garden wall at the Burra Hospital was pushed over by the weight of water. [Burra escaped the more serious flooding that inundated houses at Stockport, Hamley Bridge and Riverton.]</p>

<p>Mt Bryan Wind Turbine Concerns</p>
<p>A meeting at Mt Bryan hall last month discussed possible health effects from wind turbines. Dr Sarah Laurie, Medical Director Waubra Foundation was the guest speaker, accompanied by ABC Radio producer Petria Ladgrove. Dr Laurie is a trained rural General Practitioner. She said that like most people she had started out oblivious to any adverse health effects due to wind turbines. Her attention had been drawn to medical reports from Wales of adverse effects following a wind farm development. She subsequently established the Waubra Foundation, named after a small town northwest of Ballarat where health the problems first became public. She said the problems have now been well described from sites around the world and cited various medical researchers. Some of the illnesses have forced people from their land. This has happened in the Gippsland area, the Portland region, around Ballarat, in Queensland and now reports are coming in from the Waterloo-Mt Bryan-Hallett developments in SA. The problems have their origins in the low frequency noise generated by the plants, which can be shown to affect blood pressure and the inner ear. The sound is generally below the audible range for most people.</p>

<p>Merrie Elliott of Burra writes:</p>
<p>Emergency services at Burra Hospital were going along normally until one day in April 2010 our doctor’s right to attend emergencies there was abruptly terminated. Country Health SA offered no real reason for this other than to say the doctor was no longer qualified to undertake these duties. Since then concerned members of the public have had interviews with the Premier Mike Rann, Health Minister John Hill, representatives of Country Health SA and Tony Gwynn-Jones chair of Lower North Health Advisory Service. Despite emails, letters petitions etc. it has been impossible to get straight answers. The Minister and Country Health persistently advise us that nothing has changed and that Emergency Services are operating as normal. This is of course nonsense. Either a doctor has to come from Clare or the patient has to be sent elsewhere after assessment by the triage nurses. With lawyers, those masters of expensive delay now lurking on the scene, there is little hope of a speedy resolution. Country Health SA has been remarkable for obfuscation, lack of transparency and conflicting stories. Many are now beginning to wonder if there is a long term plan to close down the Burra Hospital and all this is a softening up process. Despite assurances from Minister Hill that this is not the case, the process is causing this fear to grow. The transfer of the ownership of the hospital to the LNHAC (Lower North Health Advisory Council – a body with little actual connection to Burra – is not reassuring.</p>
<p>‘We don’t now need to one morning discover that Burra no longer has a hospital or even a doctor, with residents then forced to go to Clare or wherever for even the most minor treatments&hellip;Burra needs to retain its hospital, a doctor and proper emergency service.</p>

<p>The Burra Hospital is in the process of being transferred from Lower North Health to the Lower North Health Advisory Council. Yorke and Lower North Health Service Director, Gary Stewart, says this will not affect funding levels or management. The transfer was highlighted in a letter sent by Health Minister John Hill on 23 December 2010 in a reply to Concerned Burra Residents regarding the LNHAC and the withdrawal of acute care privileges in respect of Dr Dharma Dissanayake at Burra Hospital. He said LNHAC also manages significant funds that have been donated by the local community to the health service. He said in the letter that the decision to cease Dr Dissanayake providing acute services was made on the advice of an independent group of medical practitioners. He also said this decision was being formally appealed and he could therefore not comment further. Burra Doctor Lakman Fernando has since offered his services along with another doctor to be recruited by Dr Fernando to fill the void. Dr Lakman now says he has reservations following the transfer of ownership of the hospital. He is concerned about who is going to fund the hospital expenses, especially the emergency department. He also disputed the statement that any independent medical officers assessed Dr Dissanayake.</p>

<p>Steve Symons Managing Director of Roaring 40s writes to correct inaccuracies in the recent article ‘Wind Farm Debt No Surprise’:</p>
<p>Roaring 40s is a 50-50 joint venture between Hydro Tasmania and Asia-Pacific energy business CLP. Roaring 40s does not have an outstanding debt to either and the venture has a solid financial foundation. I also deny the statement that we have never turned a profit because of disappointing wind speeds. As a new venture any surplus funds have been reinvested as is normal practice. A profit was not expected in the first five years. This year we expect to break even. Though wind speeds have been revised the Roaring 40s projects remain world-class. The Waterloo Farm is performing strongly and produces enough energy to power more than 46,000 homes and will result in about 300,000 tons of CO2 being abated annually. I also reject any suggestions that environmental impacts are not carefully considered.</p>
<p>Felicity Martin of Hallett writes as one of the state’s leading real estate artists. She is concerned about the impact of wind farms and says they have devalued properties by 30 to 50%. She also expresses concerns about rate inequities in the areas concerned as a result of the wind farms.</p>

<p>Peter Brodie of Burra writes on the importance of keeping the Burra Hospital:</p>
<p>When a hospital closes so does half the town. A lot of businesses close down and those that are left don’t prosper. People leave the town and the value of real estate falls. There is a flow-on effect for the school and police. Unemployment rises and the town suffers from demoralisation. [He goes on to say he knows of no reason for the campaign against Dr Dissanayake.] ‘But neither Dr Dissanayake nor members of the public are aware of any specific reason for failure during an assessment, which she was not aware was happening.’</p>
<p>[He fears the transfer of the hospital Country Health or a private business. And is worried about the possible delays in arranging the formalities for getting a doctor from the UK to share with Dr Fernando the accident and emergency services.]</p>
<p>‘After a long time without patients because of no admitting rights and people being forced to go to Clare, the Health Department will tell us that we don’t need a hospital because everybody goes to Clare.’</p>

<p>As part of the Federal Government’s ‘Building the Education Revolution’ program the school is getting new ceilings, lighting, cupboards, and other fittings and reverse cycle air-conditioning in the old building. The building has also acquired a new galvanised iron roof. The primary classes will end up with entirely refurbished rooms and the renovations will extend to the library one the classrooms have been finished. Again there will be air-conditioning, new carpets and a new circulation desk. The overall contract went to the Clare firm of I.J. McKendrick, with specialised sub-contractors. In placed the work has involved lifting floorboards and there have been some finds from beneath them. Books and sheets of paper have been recovered, some of them much decayed by damp and dirt, but others quite readable. One such was an exercise book of Cecil Rogers from 1927 in which one page records:</p>
<p>‘Our school is built on the side of a hill in Kooringa. It has been built for many years and is very large. I go to Burra School, and I am in grade five. While we are at school we must work and be obedient.</p>
<p>[Cecil Charles Rogers born 18 June 1916 York; an Adelaide suburb.)</p>

<p>Weather.</p>
<p>The weekend of Saturday &amp; Sunday 5 &amp; 6 February saw wild weather with heavy rainfall across SA. Hallett had its heaviest rainfall ever, recording 98 mm, breaking the record of 81 mm in 1890. The falls were associated with former tropical cyclone Yasi, which produced severe thunderstorms and flash flooding. Roads are closed throughout the eastern district. Several local homes were flooded and Yunta recorded 132 mm in 24 hours. Falls to the east were also high. Quondong Station recorded 130 mm over Friday &amp; Saturday and 185.8 for the entire weekend. It has had more than 560 mm since last September. Falls at Woolgangi ranged from 50 to 75 mm. Creeks and watercourses are flowing everywhere. Burra recorded 46 mm in the 24 hrs to 9 a.m. Saturday.</p>

<p>David Clarke of Armagh writes in reply to Felicity Martin disputing her conclusions about the performance of Hallett 1 &amp; 2 Wind farms. ‘In fact the performance of these two wind farms has been exceptionally high by both Australian and world standards.’ Hallett 1 is achieving a capacity factor of 40% and Hallett 2 of 39%. (That is about 40% of the power they would achieve if they were at maximum power all the time.) Anything above 30% is generally considered good and better than 35%, excellent.</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall &amp; Railway Station Restoration Work</p>
<p>An upcoming ABC television program will acknowledge the work carried out by volunteers in these two areas, especially that of Roy Taplin. Filming took place at the Town Hall and railway station. ABC presenter Simon Royal interviews volunteers. Mr Taplin is the project manager at the station, which has received a new roof and other much needed attention with the help of local tradespeople and volunteers.</p>
<p>Goyder Council has released a draft plan for dealing with climate change and natural resource management developed by Natasha Davis from Sustainable Focus. The plan seeks to achieve the following outcomes:</p>
<p>Improved Council capacity to manage NRM and climate change issues.</p>
<p>Council minimising its use of water and energy.</p>
<p>Council activities protecting and enhancing natural resources.</p>
<p>Sustainable management of water resources and environmental assets.</p>
<p>Communities actively involved in NRM and climatic change mitigations and adaptation.</p>
<p>CEO John Brak said communities that are stronger and better prepared will be better equipped to deal with threats and embrace opportunities presented by a changing climate. Copies of the plan are available from Council and on its website. Comment is invited by 11 March.</p>

<p>Nathaniel O’Brien has recently returned from the 2011 Tamworth Country Music Festival where he achieved 2nd place in the Melinda Schneider Idol Competition. Melinda has since offered him a spot as support act when she next performs in SA. After a year off to allow for vocal changes Nathaniel has had a successful return with six wins, two seconds and a third and taking out the Capital Country Music Association 2011 Talent Quest in the Best Country Duet section. He also won this trophy in 2007 with sister Tracey Rains. At the Manilla Country Music Festival (40 km from Tamworth) Nathaniel won five of five sections in Junior Vocal, Junior Gospel, Country Rock, Gospel and Open Duet and was second overall. He was also third in the Aristocrats competition from 60 other emerging stars from Australia &amp; New Zealand. Nathaniel is 15 and will attend the Camerata Academy of Country Music in July after winning the Junior Champs for SA.</p>

<p>Roaring 40s Waterloo Wind Farm will be opened by Premier Rann on Thursday 17 February. The farm has 37 turbines dotted across the 18 km site. This will give the company four operating wind farms in SA &amp; Tasmania. The managing director Steve Symons said the Waterloo Wind Farm will produce enough green energy to power 46,000 homes over 20 years. The towers were made in SA and the company has also given more than $65,000 to local community groups and over $2.4 million for local council road upgrading and maintenance.</p>
<p>A New Anti Wind Farm Group has been established: ‘Stop Industrial Wind Turbines’.</p>
<p>It will seek to inform people of issues surrounding turbines and calls for greater transparency about energy production.</p>

<p>Jazz in the Monster Mine 2011 was an outstanding success with a capacity crowd and ticket sales surpassing previous years. There were anxious moments during the rainy set-up period on Friday and Saturday morning, but the evening, though cool was dry. The planned lighting display on the cliff walls had to be reduced due to the wet conditions, but the walls were still highlighted, showcasing the spectacular setting.

<p>Weather. The heavy rains earlier this month closed the Barrier Highway in several places between Hallett and Cockburn. The Paratoo Creek ran two metres above the Three Sister Bridge 20 km west of Yunta. Pastoralists report widespread damage to dams, wing-banks, fencing and floodgates. The Burra-Sturt Vale Station road has been under water in more than a dozen places between the homestead and the station boundary. It will be weeks before that route is open. Water flowed between the homestead and the men’s quarters for three days and the homestead itself was flooded for the first time since 1926. 56 of 67 paddocks had water flow through them, but it has not yet been possible to ascertain stock and fence losses.</p>

<p>Burra Visitor Information Centre</p>
<p>Following an unforseen shortfall in funds the BVIC committee recently approached the Goyder Council for $35,000 assistance. Council last week voted to provide $12,000 from the ward fund. Cr Gill thinks any further funding is unlikely to come from Council’s general funds and the source may have to be through the Unique Services Rating Philosophy. The problem seems to have arisen from a combination of unique circumstances and a lack of adequately detailed financial reporting. A turnover of staff had used up accumulated reserves along with funding withdrawn for the SA Tourism Commission. Council normally provides $42,000 per annum and rent free offices. Other funds come from the Centre itself, including sales of the Burra Passport and accommodation. The public is being asked to register its support and there have been economies made by some reduction in hours of operation and staff. Mr Edson of BRTBA, which has been running the centre for the last eight years, said running costs were c. $160,000 p.a. It is vital that there be a one-off rescue package and that the centre continue to operate. The $12,000 provided so far will allow the centre to operate to mid March. Each year the centre services some 27,000 visitors, with about half coming from interstate and overseas. It handles about $260,000 worth of accommodation bookings as well as tickets for major local events. Sales of the Burra Passport bring in $110,000 annually. This is passed on to the National Trust and Council. The latter’s share amounts to c. $40,000 – not far short of the Council’s annual contribution to the BVIC. This is the first time since BRTBA took over that they have asked the Council for help.</p>

<p>Steve Symons Managing Director of Roaring 40s writes to thank all those who showed their support at the company’s recent open day on 19 February. Hosting 366 supporters left him with no doubt of the general support of the community. [Further details in 1⁄2 column.]</p>
<p>Dennis Parker of Yongala continues the now familiar arguments against wind farms – visual pollution, loss of amenity, health concerns and their inefficiency, in a 1⁄2-column letter.</p>
<p>Chris Harris writes thanking the Goyder Council for its support of the BVIC.</p>
<p>Aaron Niemz of Robertstown replies to the barrage of letters against wind farms in a letter of almost 1 column in which he responds to many of their concerns, indicating that he feels they are over-reacting. He denies the visual impact and loss of amenity and disputes the effects of noise from the turbines, at least at the great distance of up to 10 km that have been claimed. He also doubts any drastic effect on property values.</p>
<p>Leon Ashby, President of the Climate Sceptics, Mt Gambier writes challenging the need for a carbon tax and the supposed support for it. He also challenges the idea that solar and wind power can ever provide base load power. [Further details in c. 1⁄4 column.]</p>

<p>Roaring 40s Waterloo Wind Farm was opened by Premier Mike Rann last week. The managing director Steve Symons said they were looking to slightly extend the Waterloo farm and construct ones at Stony Gap and Robertstown.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people attended the company’s open day at the Waterloo farm. (In excess of 300.) The public had a chance to see the turbines up close and to ask questions in relation to the project and wind farms in general. The company has two full-time staff members living in the region and Vestas who supplied and will maintain the turbines has approximately six full time staff living in the area. The project has seen sponsorship of a number of local community groups and the improvement of local roads and infrastructure. [Phot of Mike Rann &amp; reporters.]</p>

<p>The Jinker</p>
<p>The lightweight structure around the Burra Mine Jinker has been repaired after almost two years of resting in disrepair.* It was damaged after a vehicle accident which also moved the jinker. People have been concerned that the jinker is now very close to the side of the creek and could be threatened by another accident. It has been decided to leave the jinker in its present position as being the course least likely to further damage it. Artlab has evaluated the jinker and found it is in reasonable condition and did not require substantial repairs either through the accident or structural deterioration. It is one of SA’s oldest transport vehicles. It once came to Burra from Adelaide pulled by 40 bullocks. It was designed to transport an 18 tonne pumping engine. A new shelter has been talked about for some years, but without any great progress. [* This statement is incorrect. The paper reported the accident in Edition No. 941, 16 June 2010, page 4.]</p>

<p>Burra Creek Reserve</p>
<p>Work has begun on the upgrading of Burra Creek Reserve. Trees have been trimmed and a large number of native trees have been planted along the creek. Edge treatment of the water area has been completed using large blocks from a local quarry. A larger area has been terraced for car parking opposite Paxton Square Cottages. And this area will ultimately be kerbed, sealed and lined. Top soil is being spread in the adjacent area and mature trees will be planted. The walking track will be realigned and in the cooler months grasses and some areas of lawn will be developed to add to the picnic type atmosphere. Seats, bins and barbecues will be installed. The area just south of the Caravan Park will then be upgraded.</p>

<p>Health Advisory Council</p>
<p>Presiding member of the LNHAC Tony Gwynn-Jones said the reforms have changed significantly from those first proposed. The State Government had originally proposed one Board for all rural SA, but this was incompatible with the Commonwealth idea that there be local control. The State has yet to respond. There are two vacancies on LNHAC and there is an advertisement about them in the paper this week. Mr Gwynn-Jones encouraged people to think about becoming involved.</p>
<p>Goyder Council has a $4,000 Youth Week Grant. This will go toward a joint ‘Sk8 in the Valley’ run jointly with Clare and Gilbert Valley Councils. There will be an expo at Clare Skate Park on 1 April featuring sponsored skateboard and BMX riders. There will also be DJ/band entertainment, sumo suits, a boxing castle and sausage sizzle.</p>

<p>Ally Fricker &amp; Bob Lamb also reply to Aaron Niemz. They say his letter is not so much concerned with the issue of wind energy as with an attempt to discredit them. They cannot admit his apparent logic that when people move to an area they should cease to exercise freedom of speech, should not bother their Councillors and should be too busy to take up such concerns. They also reject his views on the distance wind turbine sound carries.</p>

<p>A Goyder Development Assessment Panel meeting at Burra Council Chambers last week became heated over the future of wind farm developments. The panel was considering an application for two new 80 metres wind monitoring masts. More than 20 people attended, including members of ‘Stop Industrial Wind Turbines’ and Andreas Marciniak and his brother Johannes who live 3 km from the Waterloo Wind Farm. Johannes gave a heated outburst while addressing the panel, which resulted in local police being called. Andreas Marciniak said his brother became frustrated when it appeared no one was really listening and their complaints were falling on deaf ears. He predicted that others would replicate his brother’s actions as others become increasingly frustrated by the lack of attention being paid to their complaints. The site for one of the new monitoring masts is about 9 km east of Mt Bryan Township and the other about 13 km south of Burra. After hearing from the applicants and third party presenters the panel decided the masts were not at variance with the Goyder Development Plan and approved their temporary erection – to be removed within 60 months of the approval.</p>

<p>Goyder Council is facing a $10 million repair bill following the storms of December and February. This is beyond the resources of Council and formal application has been made for State Government assistance. The floods removed the surface from a huge network of roads and damaged many drainage structures including floodways, pipes, culverts and headwalls in roads. Council employees have been able to make frequently used road passable for now, but with winter rains further work will be needed to keep them open.</p>

<p>Mouse Plague? High mouse numbers have been reported for the Mid North, Murray Mallee, Eyre Peninsula and Yorke Peninsula. Stubble management in early autumn will reduce cover and reduce mouse numbers, but this must be balanced with the need for erosion control.

<p>Dudley Lehmann of Robertstown writes decrying those who oppose wind power and drawing attention to the great benefits of having electric power, unlike the past when kerosene lamps and candles ruled. No one than complained when power poles appeared and brought electricity, or when free light towers were erected to generate electricity on farms. He also dismisses fears that birds will fly into the turning blades. Electricity is such a vital component of modern life and ‘those who complain about wind farms neglect that they are generating much needed electricity, wherever it comes from has to be a great help to everyone.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>A number of questions and concerns were raised at the LNHAC Community Forum in Burra on Monday. As well as HAC members the meeting was attended by Goyder Council CEO John Brak and by Dr Lakman Fernando. Mr Gwynn-Jones welcomed those present. Great concern was expressed about the amount of time it has taken to see the question of the absence of a credentialed Doctor for accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital resolved. The lack of any evidence of progress only increased concerns. Mr Gwynn-Jones assured the forum that every effort has been made to try to resolve the matter. His understanding was that the unanimous decision to withdraw visiting privileges was made by a peer group of eight doctors. Dr Fernando claimed there was ‘no review &hellip;They just came and did work with the nurses.’</p>
<p>Questions from the floor suggested many could not see why Country health SA ‘can’t sort it out’.</p>
<p>The HAC was disappointed that Goyder Council had not expressed any concern. The HAC could not get the Council to write a letter to say they were concerned.</p>
<p>The transfer of the Hospital ownership to LNHAC concerned other people and prompted the question:</p>
<p>‘Could Burra lose its hospital?’</p>
<p>‘Shoot me if this hospital is closed in the near future,’ replied Mr Gwynne-Jones.</p>
<p>The doctors have to go through their appeal process and we have to keep trying to get a doctor into our hospital as best as we can. HAC has written to the Rural Doctors Agency [to supply an interim doctor] but indications are that sourcing a doctor for Burra is a low probability.</p>
<p>Near the end of the meeting Dr Fernando said he had arranged for a doctor to come from overseas. The new doctor would work alongside Dr Fernando &amp; Dr Dissanayake in the Burra Medical Centre and in the emergency service, initially, until Dr Dissanayake’s restriction is resolved. Once the appeal process is finished he said all three doctors would like to practice in Burra.</p>
<p>The future planning of health services in the local area has been brought to the fore by the group of concerned Burra &amp; District Residents regarding the credentialing of overseas trained doctors. (OTDs)</p>
<p>This follows complaints that were made, which were referred to and heard by Country Health SA and Scope of Clinical Practice Advisory Committee and the decision to revoke Dr Dissanayake’s attending rights at accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital.</p>
<p>It is understood Dr Dissanayake was initially credentialed to attend accidents and emergencies and continued to do so until April 2010. Since then accidents and emergencies have been attended by SA Ambulance, triage nurses at he Burra Hospital and attending doctors from Clare.</p>
<p>Group spokesperson Helen Szuty said this has had a profound effect on the community. Confidence in Dr Dissanayake has naturally diminished and many patients are now consulting doctors in Clare. This has other results in that do shopping and seek other service while there. It is natural that people feel concerned for the future of the hospital in the absence of any satisfactory solution to this problem. The problem is not unique to Burra and the group has successfully sought to have the issue included in the terms of reference for a proposed inquiry by the Social Development Committee of the SA Parliament. (A proposal to be debated in SA Parliament today, 23 March.)</p>
<p>[The terms of reference are then stated.]</p>
<p>The group urges community members and the LNHAC to make a submission to the Inquiry in an effort to resolve the current situation.</p>

<p>Burra Field Days created a positive spin-off effect for local accommodation providers and food and beverage establishments. Visitors came from all over the state and from interstate. Burra Visitor Centre was kept busy arranging accommodation. Numbers were up and indications are also good for people choosing accommodation in Burra for other regional events. Mrs Jones of the Visitor Centre said they were nearly booked out for the Bundaleer Festival in April.</p>
<p>Organisers reported the field days to be the biggest in years. Greenfields Merino scooped the Field Day Ram of the Year and the Championship Pairs. Greenfields also got third place in the pairs and second in the rams. East Bungaree was second in the pairs and third in the rams. In the new feature of Ram Lamb Pair Competition the judges favoured Collinsville based daughter stud Roemahkita Poll Merino Stud near Cummins. Drizzly rain and frequent showers on Tuesday failed to deter visitors and the marquees were full and dry.</p>
<p>A feature of the sales was $6,000 for a young White River Poll Merino ram hogget by the Daniell Family Minnipa and Poochera to Ian Rowett and family, Mernowie stud, Marrabel.</p>

<p>John Faint of The Waterloo and District Concerned Citizens Group writes contending that there needs to be much more consultation on wind farms.</p>
<p>‘The Waterloo wind farm has proved to be a disaster socially, environmentally and now we have unacceptable noise levels to contend with.’</p>
<p>‘Only selected residents from the area were invited to attend the opening by the Premier on February 17, thus shielding Mr Rann from the issues he should have been told about.’</p>
<p>‘The community day on February 19, while well attended noticeably lacked actual locals who certainly don’t have reason to celebrate.’</p>
<p>Dennis Parker of Yongala writes in reply to Mr Lehmann. He also urges the Government to investigate all methods of electricity supply, including nuclear, because ‘wind turbines are most certainly not the be-all and end-all of power production.</p>

<p>Ally Fricker responds to Dudley Lehmann. She points out that no one denied the benefits of electricity. The question is how to generate it without destroying the planet and all methods have their impact. Her view is that there is no way of doing this given our present way of using electricity and we need to turn to conserving energy and reducing demand. Birds are killed by wind turbines, especially large birds of prey and not even the wind farm owners deny this. At Woolnorth in Tasmania Roaring 40s employs a raptor expert to reduce eagle deaths, unfortunately without effect. The blade tips can be moving at up to 320 km per hour. The percussion effect caused by updraft and turbulence can crush internal organs of birds and bats.</p>

<p>Burra RSL is facing a membership crisis. It will have to close by next March if more members are not found. Next week’s Anzac service could be Burra’s last. Without more members the local branch will be unable to fill the quorum for official meetings. At the AGM there were just five present from the board of eight. Sub-Branch President John Trigg said they are fearful of closing because it could spell the end of traditional ceremonies in the town. Places lice Booleroo Centre, Melrose, Jamestown and Orroroo no longer have RSLs so they have to travel to other towns to attend Anzac and Remembrance Day services. Secretary Mike Thomas said that because Burra did not have service organisations like Rotary, Lions or Apex to take over the running of official RSL activities, we are looking to have to close for good. Members call on returned soldiers, Vietnam vets, of National Service members to join the sub-branch to keep the organisation from closing. The Anzac Day service for 2011 will take place at the War Memorial in Market Square at 6.30 a.m. on Monday 25 April. Burra Indoor Bowling Ladies will provide tea, coffee and biscuits afterwards in the Council chamber or a tot of rum donated by the Burra Hotel.</p>

<p>Frank Treloar, Burra’s First Historian</p>
<p>Frank Treloar (1852-1934) lived through the formative years of the colony of South Australia. He was born in Adelaide while his father was away at the Victorian gold fields. His youth was spent in the Clare Valley at Watervale, where he attended the famous Stanley Grammar School. As a teenager he visited the Burra Mine and saw it in full swing, visiting both Morphett’s Pump House and the underground workings. After he married at the age of twenty, Frank became part of the push to expand South Australia’s agriculture beyond Goyder’s Line. He endured five hard years of drought and crop failure, exhausting his own resources as well as those of his wife. It was hard to admit defeat and return to Watervale, where he briefly found work as a wheat agent.</p>
<p>When he was offered the position as manager of Gum Creek Station, near Burra, he took it with enthusiasm. He held this position for 18 years before moving into Burra where he worked for Goldsbrough, Mort and Co. for 30 years before retiring to Adelaide in 1930. In Burra he was one of those small group of people who work to serve the community on committees of all sorts and he became secretary to many bodies; some paying and others honorary positions. He acquired a reputation in the town as a man whose judgement was sound and whose integrity could be taken as a given.</p>
<p>Frank Treloar had long been interested in the history of the Burra Burra Mine and the township of Burra when his series of articles on the Mine was published in the local newspaper, the Burra Record, between April and July 1929, under the title Looking Back. Although others had earlier contributed articles recording their reminiscences, this was the first extended history of the famous Burra Burra Mine. So interested were people in the series that the Burra Institute Committee decide to publish the series in booklet form. The Town Council contributed £5 towards the cost and the publication was printed locally by the Burra Record. Unfortunately soon after publication a fire in Pearce’s Building largely destroyed the building and most of the print run was lost due to water damage. As a consequence the small booklet of about 50 pages has become a collectors’ item.</p>
<p>The information available in 1929 was incomplete with respect to the setting up of the Burra Burra Mine and the nearby Princess Royal Mine. After further research Treloar wrote a series of articles on the steps involved in financing and starting the two mines of the Special Survey along the Burra Creek in 1845. These appeared in the Burra Record in 1933. At various times the paper also printed other of his reminiscences and various letters to the editor.</p>
<p>The Burra History Group has now put together all of the letters and articles produced by Frank Treloar that were published in the Burra Record between 1920 and 1934. It also includes a few newspaper reports relating to his life. Frank was a dedicated amateur historian who set down for future generations an accurate and interesting account of Burra’s early days and he had in addition the ability to relate what he saw going on in the local area to the wider context of the development of South Australia socially and economically. We truly owe him a debt of gratitude both for his writing and for physically saving many of the South Australian Mining Association’s records, which had been abandoned in the company’s offices after the mine closed.</p>
<p>The Burra History Group’s reprint of Frank Treloar’s rare booklet will be launched as a 208 page book on Wednesday 18 May in the Burra Town Hall Supper Room at 2 p.m. All are welcome to attend the launch and enjoy refreshments following the event and a tour of the displays at the Town Hall as a part of SA’s History Festival.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital. After a wait of more than 12 months, Country Health SA has granted Dr Lakman Fernando privileges to attend to accident and emergencies at Burra Hospital. This applies to the end of June when CHSA will meet again to consider extending the term. Dr Fernando says he has arranged for Dr Evinta Royce to come from overseas with full Australian certificates and once her working visa has been approved they will be able to provide 24-hour on call care. This is expected to be in three to four weeks. Dr Dharma Dissanayake is still awaiting CHSA’s decision to reinstate her privileges at the hospital.</p>
<p>Goyder Heritage Plaques</p>
<p>A small group gathered at the offices of the Regional Council of Goyder in Burra last Thursday morning for the unveiling of the Goyder Heritage Plaques.

The move coincides with the 175th Anniversary of the foundation of SA. The oval plaques are in green vitreous enamel with clear lettering.

<p>Diprotodon Bones. Paul &amp; Michelle Cousins and family came across large leg bones sticking out of the ground on the Collinsville property near Mt Bryan. On closer inspection they realised that they were probably diprotodon bones and contacted the SA Museum. Associate Professor of Biological Science at Flinders University Rod Wells led a team of palaeontology students on a dig last weekend and confirmed their identity. All the creeks in the area like Widow Creek, Baldina Creek &amp; Newikie Creek have yielded similar finds in the past. Fossil remains of extinct marsupials were first reported from a dam site at Bundey and along the Baldina Creek in 1889.</p>

<p>Burra Visitor Information Centre</p>
<p>The Centre appears to be back on track after some weeks of uncertainty. It is running within its budget and visitor numbers for April and May have been very encouraging. Financial assistance has been obtained from the Goyder Council and from a very generous donation from local identity Mr Les Warnes. BRTBA President Peter Edson expressed the committee’s gratitude for Mr Warne’s generosity. Helped by mild weather and a five-day Easter holiday, the visitor numbers ‘for April rise 115%’ compared with 2010. [Does this mean an increase of 115% - more than doubling last year’s, or is the 2011 figure 115% of the 2010 figure? The latter seems more likely since in May 3008 were served compared with 2506 in 2010 – which would give a figure of 120% or an increase of 20%.]</p>

<p>Darrol Pollard will close his antique business in Commercial Street when he retires this month after almost 40 years in business. He began trading in the early 1970s on the corner of Commercial and Queen Streets and moved across the street ten years later for 30 years of successful trading in old wares and antiques. In his time in business he hired props to the films Breaker Morant and Fair Game. Darrol says the interest in antiques has changed and more recently the younger buyers are looking for techno savvy products and modern appliances. After 30 years without a holiday he is looking forward to travelling and catching up with relatives. [Photo]</p>

<p>The Burra Doctor Situation</p>
<p>The Rural Doctors Workforce Agency CEO Lyn Poole attended the Goyder Council meeting on Tuesday to discuss the current situation regarding the process of recruiting a doctor for Burra. Dr Lakman Fernando and other interested community members were also there. Ms Poole said the recruited doctor’s credentials and documentation would be presented to the Medical Board this week. If successful they will then start the process of visas. That could see the doctor here in the next two or three months. The new doctor will be able to assist in the practice, but emergency privileges will only be made possible by 24-hour supervision by part-time doctor Lakman Fernando, who has been granted emergency privileges. We have a doctor here all the time who does not have and chooses not to have privileges, Ms Poole said. The Medical Board requires some form of supervision of any international doctor who’s not fellowed. They can get that within two to three years and the RWDA encourages them. The process of getting the new doctor in place can be expected to take from two to six months.</p>

<p>Ben Kotz was presented with a long service certificate to Burra RSL Sub Branch at a small gathering of RSL Members and his family at Holder Home Burra yesterday morning. His daughter Marilyn Heyer of Adelaide came for the occasion, and so did niece Maryann Thamm of Burra. Mr Kotz has been secretary of the local sub-branch for longer than anyone can remember. Mr Kotz, 92, said he joined the RSL on returning from WW II in 1945. Sub-Branch President John Trigg presented the certificate for an outstanding contribution to the Burra RSL Sub-Branch and service to the community and to the interests of ex-servicemen’s welfare.</p>

<p>The 91st Norwood Cycling Club ‘Burra Classic’ Cycle Race will be held on Saturday 6 August, with the inaugural Peter Reilly Handicap run on Sunday 7 August.</p>
<p>The race was first run in 1907. Sir Hubert Opperman took the win and fastest time honours twice in the 1920s and a fastest time in an earlier attempt. Keith Thurgood recorded the fastest time seven times, ended by his first outright win in 1935 and then had another amazing win in 1967. Saturday’s race starts at the Town Hall and goes to Mt Bryan and back before going on to Robertstown and return, for a total of 125 km. The Peter Reilly Handicap commemorates a local supporter of the event who sadly died last year. There will also be races for juniors over the weekend.</p>

<p>Burra Out of School Hours Care</p>
<p>About 39 people attended a meeting at the school on Monday night to discuss the impending suspension of OSHC. The governing council decided on the suspension due to low attendance and financial difficulties in recent months. Craig Honan chaired the meeting. Parents were angry because they were not forewarned of the move and said they could have boosted attendance, had they been aware of the threat. The current debt is $5,574. Speakers said winter was inevitably a time of lower usage. A minimum number of five children per day would ensure that the service remains viable for the meantime. It is highly likely there will be a moderate increase in fees. Executive member and school Principal Tony Maio proposed a four week window of opportunity, in which the service would remain open to provide the community with the opportunity to do what they could to assist the service. This move was carried and an effort will be made to establish a committee.</p>

<p>The Burra Cycling Classic</p>
<p>The Norwood Cycling Club held its annual race in Burra last weekend. Both senior and junior events honoured the late Peter Reilly who had been a great friend and supporter of the event over many years. Josh Smith won the inaugural Peter Reilly Handicap for Women’s and Masters. [Sic!] The event on Sunday morning threw heavy rain and fierce wind at the riders. Smith made his winning move about 6 km from the finish and held on all the way to the line. Burra’s representative, Constable Matt Daum, did well in achieving a personal best and placing in the top 10 in the Masters. In Saturday’s Classic he finished 20th out of 87 and recorded a personal best.</p>

<p>Tom Koutsantonis, Mineral Resources Development Minister, was in Burra last Wednesday to hear oral submissions regarding the proposed exploration of the Burra Mine. Phoenix Copper is keen to undertake diamond drilling along the projected northern extension of the Monster Mine at Burra North. The drilling program has been suspended pending the Minister’s decision on the lifting of reserve status for the mine area. The Minister heard submissions and will now digest all the information and then return to Burra with a decision. A spokesperson for the Minister said a decision could be expected very soon. Mr Koutsantonis met with representatives from the Council, the National Trust, BRTBA, Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee and the CMC. Phoenix Copper was not represented, not having been advised of the discussions.</p>

<p>The Warnes’ 1913 Newton Bennet</p>
<p>Les Warnes’ 1913 Newton Bennett made its final run to Birdwood recently and it will now take its place there among dozens of other vintage and veteran cars. The car was handed over to Les by his father in 1937 on Woolgangi. Les had been driving out there since he was 12 when the family had a 501 Fiat (1927 model). The car had originally been owned by Dr Sangster [Jnr] of Burra. Mr Warnes has driven the car in many Bay to Birdwood Rallies. He and his brothers also drove in veteran runs in 1942 &amp; 1943. Les used the car for rabbit trapping when he was young. The original parking lights were kerosene powered and the headlights used acetylene gas.</p>

<p>Burra Mine. Matt Reilly says that there is very likely a large ore deposit under the Burra Heritage Area. Mr Reilly was granted the right to explore for several weeks in 2007 in an area adjacent to the dump access road. He claims that his small operation revealed large deposits, which could drive the town’s economy and real estate sector. ‘We could well see a housing jump by 200%.’ He claimed. After this discovery he bought into Phoenix. In 2007 the Regional Council, PIRSA and the Heritage Advisor granted the permission for the exploration. This brings into question why Phoenix has been forced to wait more than 15 months for a decision on its proposal. Mr Reilly blames well publicised opposition to the exploration, which he says is not beneficial to the town’s future. He says he is concerned for the younger generation and the future of the town. He says for the first time in 200 years three hotels in Burra have closed within 18 months. ‘If someone doesn’t do something, this town’s going to disappear. Exploration of the site would provide ‘the potential for Burra to move forward’.</p>

<p>Steve &amp; Anne Royal write in response to Matt Reilly on mining in Burra.</p>
<p>Matt Reilly says he welcomes a strong debate. In such it is essential to assess relevant facts. Some of these facts are:</p>
<p>According to Phoenix Copper’s 2010 Annual Report Mr Reilly has over 1.5 million shares in the company and has been granted a further 2 million options. If exploration commences in the mine reserve he will receive a further 800,000 shares and 800,000 options. If a significant ore reserve is discovered, he will receive $200,000 and a further $100,000 if any tailings or waste material from the Monster Mine is processed. He will also receive 6% royalty for all metals derived from the mine. Mr Reilly says three hotels have closed in Burra, but fails to mention that two of them have reopened. The closure of at least one of them seems to have nothing to do with the lack of mining in Burra. At last year’s town meeting the New Zealand town of Waihi (pop. 4,500) was actively marketed by Phoenix as a shining example of how great mining was for a town. Newmont Mining operates a large open cut gold mine in the middle of town and Waihi’s situation is similar to what Burra may be facing. Far from being a bonanza for the town, it seems to have been very bad for them. According to the NZ census data for 2006 the median income for Waihi residents is $15,200 compared with a median income of $24,100 p.a. for the whole Waikato Region.</p>
<p>In Waihi 62% of the population has an annual income of $20,000 or less. For the entire region this figure is 43%. In the town only 7% earn over $50,000, while for the region this figure is 17%. The region has 5.3% unemployment, while Waihi has 8.2%. The mine seems to have done little for real estate either. The average house price in the Coromandel region is $415,110 and in Waihi it is $307,000 with about 200 houses for sale in the town. Several houses in Waihi have disappeared into the ground and several others are deemed to unsafe to live in.</p>
<p>Mr Reilly asserts that ‘there is money in the mine&hellip;and that money is for Burra’. This is not correct. Any money in the mine will be for Phoenix Copper and a few of their stakeholders, Mr Reilly included. There will be a few short term jobs created – Phoenix themselves give only a five-year lifespan for Burra operations. After that Burra would be left with no new jobs, no mine and no money, just one hell of a mess to clean up.</p>
<p>We wholeheartedly support Phoenix Copper in their ventures in the region, but mining must not commence in Burra or in any other residential area. Burra needs to find a way of progressing that does not rely on the destruction of the town.</p>
<p>Mr Koutsantonis at a meeting in Burra on 17 August said there was no way that he would allow mining in the Burra Mine pit. It is disappointing that this announcement hasn’t received more publicity.</p>

<p>The Group of Concerned Burra &amp; District Residents met with the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing in Adelaide last week. This meeting was discussing the registration process and support available for overseas trained doctors. Ways to improve pathways and remove impediments without imperilling standards were discussed. The Burra group spoke to supplement its written submission and arose from the ongoing situation which prevents Dr Dissanayake from attending emergencies at Burra Hospital. They explained the progress of the case. Helen Szuty said that during a recent planned review of Dr Dissanayake’s credentials and scope of clinical practice at Burra Hospital, she had her attending rights to accidents and emergencies at Burra Hospital reinstated after 16 months. Due to the recent arrival of Dr Evinta Royce, Dr Dharma Dissanayake, Dr Lakman Fernando and Dr Royce expect to commence emergency services at Burra Hospital from the first week in October 2011. The Group understands that Drs Dissanayake and Fernando intend to proceed with an Application for Judicial Review in the Supreme Court, over what has happened. The group considered that the policies on credentialing etc. require legislative action. They thanked the Clare Doctors for treating accidents and emergencies over the last 16 months. The standing Committee on Health and Ageing recommended the group meet with the Federal Member for grey to find out more about federal grants for regional hospitals and health services and the group intends to follow this up.</p>

<p>Patrick La Vagueresse writes re Mining in Burra.</p>
<p>Matt Reilly may be criticised, but he has one thing in mind; the future of Burra.</p>
<p>He has invested and risked a lot and done so before anyone cared to see where Burra would go. I watch Burra kids decide to leave Burra for Clare or somewhere else once they get to Year 11 or 12, to get a better education. You cannot rely on tourism to keep money flowing into local businesses. Mr Reilly spoke to me before this debate started and encouraged me to keep promoting baseball, even if there are not many members. He said all sporting clubs need to continue their hard work, as kids are the town’s future. We need jobs to keep youth in Burra. Matt was criticised for not saying two of the three closed hotels have reopened. True, but notice of one reopening was in the same paper as his letter. The Royal exchange only reopened because Matt and his son were prepared to reinvest in it.</p>
<p>[The writer concludes with a dismissal of wind farms as employment and the problems of Adchem in finding forklift drivers and rounds off with the sentence: ‘Stop complaining and look for other options instead of criticising others.’</p>
<p>Stuart Norris writes on the same issue. He was at first enraged by the attack on one of the town’s leading citizens.</p>
<p>He makes a series of points.</p>
<p>Burra exists because of mining.</p>
<p>Many tourists come because of our mining heritage.</p>
<p>The Monster Mine saved the state from bankruptcy.</p>
<p>As for the Waihi evidence. Statistics can be manipulated at will. Many hippies moved there in the 1970s and 1980s and this may skew unemployment. A large number of old age pensioners can also skew income figures.</p>
<p>Mines can co-exist with successful towns as in Mt Isa, Broken Hill, Kalgoorlie, Ballarat and Bendigo.</p>
<p>Phoenix Copper welcomed submissions to the Minister about any concerns and welcomes anyone to speak to them about concerns.</p>
<p>Phoenix wished to explore around the old mine area.</p>
<p>Jobs for locals would be created.</p>
<p>No historic building would be demolished.</p>
<p>If a sizeable deposit was discovered they would have to apply for permission to mine that deposit.</p>
<p>No homes in Burra would fall into the pit. Assertions along these lines are not based on facts.</p>
<p>Mine workers would spend money in the town. To assert that money from the mine would not find its way into local businesses is not true.</p>
<p>When mining ceases Burra would be much the same as now.</p>
<p>All environmental aspects would have to be adhered to, revegetation would have to be undertaken and the clean-up carried out by the mining company.</p>
<p>At a town meeting in 2010 60% of the people were in favour of a mine starting.</p>
<p>If you don’t like living in a mining town you are always welcome to leave.</p>
<p>Let’s hope the Minister grants Phoenix Copper the exploration rights it is seeking</p>
<p>The town needs a boost, even if the mine lasts only five years.</p>
<p>Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes welcoming the news that the local doctor has her rights at the Burra hospital reinstated. She thanks the efforts of the local group who fought for a resolution. She feared there was a hidden agenda to close the hospital. She expands on the work of the group and thanks them at some length for their efforts and stresses the need for the hospital to continue and the importance of being ever vigilant to see and counter threats to its doing so.</p>

<p>OSHC Burra has received a cheque for $1,500 from the National Bank’s Community Grants Program. Burra Community School Principal Tony Maio said the grant was very welcome and helped to stabilise a desperate situation. The four week review has been concluded with the result that it has been decided the Burra OSHC will remain open with an update of changes resulting from the review. These recommendations have been ratified by the Governing Council and will apply to the Vacation Care and the after hours care in term four.</p>

<p>Burra Creek &amp; Princess Royal Station Wines has an increased export potential after an invitation to China where purchasers gathered at an organic wine exhibition. The company produces from 30 acres of ‘dry grown’ Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Manager Lisa Rowe was invited to Chongqing (pop. 35 million) to attend an exhibition where wines were introduced to a group of 200 potential purchasers. This follows a substantial order for four of their lines. Organic Certification was a point of difference. The Chinese market is emerging and education on the handling and consumption of wines will need to be addressed. The Burra wines were well received and orders are anticipated.</p>

<p>William Plain writes re the storage shed on Mt Pleasant. He outlines the tourism facts that Burra receives about 50,000 tourists a year and many are attracted by authentic heritage. The visitors spend about $7 million annually. Many businesses and activities benefit from the tourist dollar. Tourism keeps the town alive. A large industrial shed looking down over the main street is definitely not heritage. Degradation of the town’s authentic heritage will ultimately affect your back pocket. Burra is attempting to establish an Industrial Zone and the shed would be ideally suited to such a zone.</p>

<p>Burra Mine</p>
<p>SA Mining Minister, Tom Koutsantonis, has rejected Phoenix Copper’s application to lift the protection status of the Burra Mine site. This follows a long wait by Burra residents who have formed divisive opinions regarding the proposal. The Minister said he had decided not to lift the reserve because ‘the heritage value of the site is too great’.</p>
<p>‘It’s time to mine other regions.’</p>
<p>He also said that to set conditions would involve ‘too many politics’ to allow it to proceed.</p>
<p>Although Phoenix was a good company, the return would not justify the angst. Phoenix will still be able to explore and mine in and around Burra, but the Minister said he ‘can’t in any good conscience allow them in the Monster Mine’.</p>
<p>Goyder Council Mayor, Peter Mattey, felt that compromises should have been discussed. He believed they could have opened up part of the mine site. He felt the community was leaning toward the possibility of exploration.</p>
<p>He thought Phoenix would probably go on looking around the perimeter.</p>
<p>National Trust SA President David Beaumont expressed relief at the decision. He said the Monster Mine was of national importance and has been nominated for World Heritage listing as a trans-national component of Cornish Mining Sites. The site also protects important remnant grassland and 24% of the indigenous species have conservation ratings at the national, state and regional level.</p>
<p>Phoenix Copper managing director Peter Dowd said he did not understand the decision, but that the company was committed to exploration outside the reserve in the Burra North prospect. He would be contacting the Minister for further clarification as there were issues that were contradictory to what has been the case previously. The company would not be taking their bat and ball and going home.</p>

<p>Burra Show</p>
<p>The show was a winner with more than 1,400 people attending. Many positive comments were heard and Show President Tim Stockman said this year’s show saw a good run of entries, particularly in floral art. There were some great entries in all divisions and it was especially pleasing to see the junior involvement in the floral section. Tracking entries had been made easier by the new computerised system in use. The weather of the preceding week had been wet, but Show Day had been sunny before rain returned on the Sunday. The recent outbreak of pigeon disease in Victoria meant there was no pigeon or poultry section this year. The merino shearing competition continues to be the premier shearing competition on the SA Shows circuit. The ute and car competition saw a good turn-out. The wool pavilion with its newly featured wool packs above the exhibits drew favourable comment. The named wool packs were an initiative of convenor Andrew Butler Rural Services and allowed each exhibitor to pay a fee for their named wool pack to be displayed, which went towards a generous $1,000 donation to the Burra Show Society. The support of the local community in putting the event together is to be commended. President John Oates thanked sponsors for their continuing support and also the judges, convenors, stewards and all those who contributed to the local event.</p>

<p>Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes to express her relief that the doctor situation at the Burra Hospital has been resolved. She is also concerned about the title to the hospital, which carries the provision that the land must be used for a hospital. She is fearful of there being a smart legal subterfuge that would enable the land to be sold off or used for another purpose. She urges attendance at a concert 15 October in Burra Town Hall by Paul O’Bryan to raise funds for the hospital. And urges vigilance on the hospital front to forestall and hidden agenda from depriving the town of this vital facility.</p>
<p>Peter Batten writes re Burra’s future. He floats the idea that education would be a viable alternative to mining as a way to inject jobs and money into the town and so provide for its growth and its future. He suggests a residential college for 200-300 students would fit in with sustaining the heritage values of the town. The aim would be to attract international students and five star accommodation for visiting parents etc. would be needed. Modern medical facilities would also be needed.</p>
<p>Pip Edson writes thanking those who attended the opening of the Art of the Flower exhibition and canvassing the virtues of having such a venture in the town. She urges people to visit and support the gallery, which is one of the larger spaces in which regional art is displayed in SA.</p>

<p>Jo Van Gasteren writes as Secretary of the Burra &amp; Districts Obedience Dog Club.</p>
<p>The club was the object of thieves over the weekend, losing over $3,000 worth of equipment including a ride-on mower and a new whipper-snipper. The building was also subject to a graffiti attack. This is a cretinous attack on a hard working group who have been ticking along now for nearly 19 years. The club will regroup and struggle on. The stuff taken will mean a few dollars to someone, but ‘a lot more to us as it was earned honestly through sheer bloody hard work and personal sacrifice.’ The club was not insured for theft. We cannot manage the $2,000 a year that insurance would cost. If you see one of our members clutching a book of raffle tickets in the near future please consider buying some to help the club get back on its feet, if you are able to.</p>
<p>Pat Svensdotter writes reporting the same incident, seeking help in getting the club back in action and appealing for any witnesses to step forward if they saw anything of the attack.</p>
<p>P. Le Vagueresse President of the Burra Baseball Club writes reporting a break-in at the Baseball Club as well – for the second time in six months. The club is not licensed and so the amount of damage done for a few soft drinks, a first aid kit, spade, shovel, posthole digger and circular saw, makes no sense. The club will persevere and continue to offer clinics etc. in term 4. The golf club has also been left with similar repair costs due to the same incident.</p>

<p>Stop Industrial Wind Farms (SIWF), the local protest group, is outraged by the SA Government’s changes to the development assessment process. The former process led to a successful appeal in the Environment, Resources and Development Court, against the Allendale Wind Farm. On 19 October the Government changed the rules for assessing wind farm proposals. Ms Ally Fricker for SIWF said it was clear the Government never had any intention that appeals could succeed and so have changed the rules so that there can be continued development of wind farms without the hindrance of community opposition through third party appeals. The changes have been made to give greater certainty to the industry, but have delivered greater uncertainty to thousands of people across rural SA.</p>
<p>Setbacks of one kilometre from homes and two kilometres from towns make a mockery of protection from noise impacts or loss of visual amenity and give no consideration to wild life. Councils will no longer be obliged to notify the public of impending developments; only adjoining landowners need be notified.</p>
<p>Edition No. 1004, 26 October 2011, pages 1 &amp; 3</p>
<p>Wind Farm Approval Changes</p>
<p>Two local councils are concerned that Government changes to the process of approving wind farm developments will dramatically reduce the required level of public consultation. The Regional Council of Goyder and the Northern Areas Council are urging residents to become informed about the changes and to take the opportunity to make comment. Goyder CEO, John Brak, said he expected that Council would make a submission to the Department of Planning and Local Government on the matter. The significance that the Council can place on visual appearance has been greatly reduced. The changes move wind farms from category 3 developments to category 2. This requires that only adjoining landowners need to be notified and only adjoining landowners may make written representations to Council. The presiding member can decide whether to allow a person making a representation to speak in support before the Council’s Development Assessment Panel and neither the person making the representation nor any member of the public. Previously any owner of land likely to be affected and any member of the public could make representations. Anyone submitting a written representation had the right to be heard before the Development Assessment Panel and any person who made a representation had the right to appeal the decision.

<p>Marie Abbott of Burra celebrated her 99th birthday recently. Mrs Abbott still lives independently in her own home and was joined on the occasion by family members, including her sister Kath Scholz, who celebrated her 95th birthday and son Leo, who was celebrating his 70th. Mrs Abbott was born Marie Hogan at Leighton and lived there with her parents until marrying Leo Abbott in 1940. She attended Leighton school till aged 10 and then went with her sister Dorothy as boarders at the St Joseph’s Convent in Spalding after it was built in 1921. The subjects included reading, spelling, copybook writing, religion and music. When Marie first went to school she went by horse and cart. She went on to teach music, travelling around the Booborowie area with her violin, by horse and sulky. When she drove some 10 miles beyond Booborowie she would stay overnight. On one such trip with her brother they had an accident and the violin got broken. Mrs Abbott also continued to play the piano well and played the organ at church until she was 90. Singing around the piano with family and friends was a popular form of entertainment in the time before television. She also went to her grandparents’ home to listen to concerts on the wireless. Card games such as bridge and euchre also provided entertainment. On special occasions the family would travel to a neighbour’s and listen to the commentary on the wireless of the test matches when Australia played England for the Ashes. Of the changes she has seen, cars, TV and telephones perhaps had most impact. Washing machines also made a big difference. She recalls using a scrubbing board to do the clothes. When she got married they lived in a prefab house with no insulation and a wood stove. There was no refrigerator. Not until after her third child did they get a kerosene refrigerator. Mrs Abbot can’t remember what year they got electricity, but it certainly made getting hot water easier.</p>

<p>Burra Early Learning Centre held an open day last Thursday, following extensive refurbishment. Burra Community School Principal, Tony Maio, Sue Ryan and DECS Regional Director Terry Sizer also attended. The Centre’s Director Sarah Stoddard welcomed visitors and introduced former Director Brenda Villis. She spoke about the origins of the centre. The original plans for the site were drawn up on 21 May 1981, with the opening taking place in December 1981. For many years the centre provided four session of pre-school, one play group session and one unfunded occasional care session per week. A community meeting held at the site decided that there was a need for additional care in Burra. Eventually DECS agreed to fund three occasional care sessions per week and one session for under twos. The offer was accepted, but the under two session could not be run because of the lack of nappy changing facilities. Two years later DECS agreed to fund a bathroom upgrade. The snag was that the centre needed to fund the additional floor space. Plans were drawn up by Frank Endermann, facilities manager at the Building Management Facilities Services at Clare and Mc Kendrick Builders from Clare began work last year in the October holidays.</p>
<p>The centre has been well supported by groups and hard-working parents, who have raised money each year to allow the facility to be placed in a sound financial position and to permit extra alterations and new learning facilities for the children. [A selection of photographs is published.]</p>

<p>The Fire Engine Rally and Craft Fair last weekend was a success. More than 700 people visited the site during the weekend. Engine rides proved popular. The craft fair also went well with different stalls located in each cell at the old Redruth Gaol. Branch chairman of the National Trust Paul Marsson said the organisers were thrilled with the success. Stalls included jewellery, handmade chocolates, leather and woodwork, scrapbooking, clothing, plants, trading table goodies, fabrics, Rawleigh’s products, stamping and face-painting.</p>

<p>A New Iron Ore Mine</p>
<p>It is quite likely that Royal Resources will develop a new iron ore mine situated some 80 km northeast of Peterborough and 40 km south of Yunta. Investigations by the SA Government in the 1960s revealed the deposit, which was purchased by Royal Resources in 2009. The prospect is for an open cut mine to win 500 million tons already defined, (with perhaps as much again to come) and a 30 year lifespan. It is estimated that there would be 1,000 jobs in the construction phase and 400 in the operational phase. It is not expected to be a fly-in fly-out mine and Peterborough is well placed to benefit from the development. A Memorial of Understanding has been signed with key rail operators and Flinders Ports and a Native Title agreement signed with the traditional owners – the Ngadjuri. The decision to mine and initial construction is expected to be undertaken in the period 2013-15.</p>

<p>Ally Fricker, chairperson of SIWT writes again opposing wind farm development. This time she is reporting an investigation of a conflict of interest by the SA Ombudsman. In May 2011 SIWT requested this investigation when Cr John Neal did not consider he had a conflict of interest and should step down from the Goyder Council Development Assessment Panel. The panel was hearing an application relating to a wind energy project at Stony Gap and Cr Neal receives some income from the same developer. The Ombudsman agreed there was a clear conflict of interest. It was disturbing that Cr Neal’s stand was supported by Goyder’s CEO, John Brak; Mayor, Peter Mattey and the DAP Chair, Colleen Woodgate. The recent changes to the rules make it all the more important that there is full financial disclosure and no conflict of interest amongst members of Council’s decision making bodies.</p>
<p>[She then goes on to draw attention to the changes to assessment procedures as outlined in Edition No. 1004, 26 October 2011, pages 1 &amp; 3.]</p>

<p>Wind Farm Appeal Upheld</p>
<p>Bill Quinn of Mt Bryan has won an appeal against the Environment, Resources and Development Court’s approval of AGL’s Hallett Stage 3 Wind Farm. The court found that the wind turbines owned by AGL, and operating at Hallett 2 Wind Development are currently incapable of satisfying current SA EPA guidelines. The appeal also challenged the SA EPA Wind Farm Noise Guidelines on the grounds that they do not adequately protect human health. There was, however, no determination of the merits of any of the grounds of the appeal.</p>
<p>A resident neighbouring the Hallett Hill Wind Farm (Hallett 2) has brought a noise complaint to AGL. The company has investigated the matter and preliminary results of tests have reported some audible tones under certain conditions. Upon becoming aware of this tonality issue in December 2010 AGL shut down a number of turbines in proximity to the residence. Sixteen of the 34 turbines are currently shut down at night. The company has been working with the supplier of the turbines to rectify the fault. The supplier has developed a permanent acoustic treatment to address the tonality issue, but until this permanent acoustic treatment can be implemented Hallett 2 will operate with 16 turbines shut down at night between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.</p>

<p>BRTBA has had a satisfying year according to President Peter Edson. With the support of the Goyder Council and a generous donation from Burra Resident Mr Les Warnes, the financial crisis that threatened the survival of the Burra Visitor Information Centre has been overcome. Its facilities have been upgraded and it has passport sales and accommodation bookings have been very pleasing. Burra should be proud of the fact that the centre attracts far more visitors than many larger regional centres. BRTBA staged Jazz in the Monster Mine and the Antique Fair and in conjunction with the National Trust held a successful Craft Fair at the Redruth Gaol. These events play a vital role in promoting tourism. The Association will hold an end of year break-up at the Visitor Information Centre on 6 December at 5.30 p.m.</p>

<p>Lane Crockett, General Manager Australia of Pacific Hydro, writes re alleged health problems caused by wind farms. He challenges the assertion in a recent letter that ‘Peer reviewed medical research by suitably qualified persons is available &hellip;that clearly and unequivocally shows that persons living close to wind turbines may suffer a range of medical conditions.’</p>
<p>In fact:</p>
<p>Australia’s National Health &amp; Medical research Council, Victorian Chief Medical Officer and SA’s EPA have all concluded that there is no scientific or medical evidence that wind farms have adverse health impacts.</p>
<p>Doctors for the Environment have supported this finding.</p>
<p>Public Health expert Professor Simon Chapman of Sydney University has recently published an article in the Medical Journal of Australia an article questioning who has fomenting community anxiety over this issue and questions the agendas of anti-wind farm groups. Wind farms have been around for over two decades and yet claims that they directly threaten health are far more recent. More than 100 million Europeans live within 10 km of a wind turbine and yet the issue is not on the radar of a single science academy in the world.</p>
<p>Pacific Hydro takes adverse health effects very seriously. An independent report tested the levels of infrasound produced by wind turbines and the results showed they were well below perception levels and importantly well below levels produced by other natural and man-made sources. One of the highest levels of infrasound was at a beach.</p>
<p>Various medical researchers and other academics have supported the claim that ‘there is no consistent evidence of any physiological of behavioural effect of acute exposure to infrasound in humans’ including Dr Gary Wittert, whose epidemiological survey found no correlation between increased prescription for related medical conditions claimed to be exacerbated by wind turbine operations.</p>

The Worlds End Highway was closed from the Thiele Highway intersection to the Industry Road-Three Chain Road intersection. Baldina and Newikie Creek pushed silt and mud across roads making them impassable. Houses were flooded at Eudunda and rapidly flowing water damaged gardens, streets and floodways. Fierce winds and hail were experienced at Gum Creek and Leighton, while Farrell Flat and Mintaro experienced intense hail, some the diameter of a 10 cent piece.</p>
<p>In Burra storm water flooded the rear of the Burra Hospital, the Open House Gift Shop, the Luck Dip, Saltbush, local garages and the CookO’Burra snack bar.</p>
<p>Crops have been damaged in a band from Whyalla to Morgan. Unreaped cereals have been lost, with losses of c. $100 per ton as produce is downgraded to feed. The Hut and Hill Rivers flooded. The fall will put some moisture into the subsoil, but at a considerable cost.</p>
<p>Lightning damaged ElectraNet’s 132 kV Bungama to Baroota transmission line and cut power to 3,500 consumers.</p>

<p>Lynette Suridge writes to thank the Burra Christmas Fair Committee for their effort in producing such a grand show.</p>
<p>Merrie Elliott of Booborowie writes expressing concern that Country Health SA is seeking to have the title of the land on which the Burra hospital stands transferred to it from the Burra Burra Hospital Inc. of Kooringa. This is a practice throughout the state, but there appears to be no guarantee that it will not then be sold on. It is not inconceivable that a future owner may not want a hospital on his piece of ground. Surely it is short sighted to move the ownership of a vital asset from local control to the hands of an entity composed largely of people with no links to that community. These quasi government bodies are forever changing. If I am wrong, this letter will enable someone to come forward to put the record straight and publicly explain, in understandable language, with no fudging or waffling, just exactly what is happening and why.</p>

<p>Flood Fund</p>
<p>Goyder Council has secured more that $6 million to repair roads and infrastructure damaged by recent flood events. This was confirmed at a meeting in Eudunda as part of the Minister’s road trip to meet the Mayors and CEOs of flood affected councils. Minister Russell Wortley presented a letter to Mayor Peter Mattey, confirming the long awaited good news. The $6,357,200 would be paid in two equal instalments, the first in the 2011-12 financial year and the second in the 2012-13 financial year. It is expected the program of work to repair damage to roads, watertables, floodways and stormwater infrastructure will spread over four to five years and will involve sourcing additional skilled labour and contractors to supplement the council workforce.</p>

<p>Lorraine Stevens, Farrell Flat resident, is Burra Ward Citizen of the Year. She has been nominated for helping the aged over many years. At age 17 she came to Farrell Flat to care for her six unmarried aunts and uncles for 25 years until they died. She also catered for visiting relatives and had a very busy time over Christmas. After that she continued to care for the elderly, working for the Country Home Advocacy Project and for Helping Hand. Over the years she has assisted over 100 people in the area from Hallett to Waterloo and Burra to Clare and Auburn. This has meant early morning calls to get people out of bed and late evening visits to put them into bed. While not the one to take on the roles of President or secretary of organisations, she has consistently been the one to roll up when help was required, when working bees were organised or food etc. was needed for a function or stall. She has long supported the Farrell Flat Uniting Church, the Ladies’ Fellowship and the Burra Uniting Church Op Shop. She has also been active in the Royal Flying Doctors Auxiliary, the Women’s and children’s Hospital Auxiliary, Lifeline and the Farrell Flat Management Committee. She has spent a lifetime caring for others in a selfless way. [Photo]</p>

<p>Luck Dip Gift Shop &amp; SA Lotteries Outlet will close on Saturday after more than 24 years. Colleen Spackman and her sister Sandra Snook bought the shop in 1988. Colleen has been the primary operator with Sandra having relocated to other places with family for work. Sandra returned to the shop, when Colleen became ill, along with younger sister Keryl Maidment more recently. Continuing health conditions have forced the sale. Colleen says she is tired and needs a rest, after which she intends to travel. She has plans to go to the Cowell Country Music Festival, to WA to visit another sister and to Darwin on The Ghan. The SA Lotteries will continue to operate while the shop is refitted for the new Burra Chemmart.</p>

<p>A letter is published from Dr Lynn Arnold AO, CEO of Anglicare Australia and Dr Jeffrey Driver, Anglican Archbishop of Adelaide. It takes issue with the letter of Ken Grundy published last week:</p>
<p>The letter was ill-informed and did not fully reflect our views or those of Anglicare SA. The Constitution of Australia reflects a time when Aboriginal people were discriminated against. It allows any Australian Government to make laws based on race. Section 25 allows people to be excluded from voting by virtue of their race alone. Section 25 and Section 51 (xxvi) are no longer defensible and should be repealed. We believe the Constitution should contain a statement guaranteeing cannot be legally discriminated against based on race. It should contain a statement recognising the value of Aboriginal peoples and their languages as the nation’s first people.</p>

<p>Farrell Flat Institute Hall Centenary</p>
<p>A very successful weekend of celebration was held on 28-29 January to mark the centenary of the laying of the foundation stone for the Farrell Flat Hall. Over 600 people attended the events. A plaque at the hall was unveiled by long time resident Clyde Atkins and a new heritage walk compiled by Laurel Neill and Sally Fieldhouse was launched. Also launched was a 196-page pictorial history of Farrell Flat, Times Past, by local author and historian Gerald Lally. The day was rounded off with an old time dance in the newly refurbished hall with local band Bold as Brass with MC Jack Kleinig. About 90 attended.</p>
<p>On Sunday the Clare Valley Flying Group staged a fly over and the oldest living resident, Marie Abbott, who turns 100 in October, cut the birthday cake, assisted by 2012 Citizen of the Year, Lorraine Stevens. The cake was cut with the trowel used 100 years earlier to lay the foundation stone of the hall. Visitors spent the day talking to old friends, taking the heritage walk and visiting the community garden and the private garden at the railway station.</p>

<p>Commercial Street</p>
<p>The Burra Community Management Committee is seeking to promote public discussion regarding the Goyder Council’s plans for a pedestrian refuge in Commercial Street. The CMC is concerned to promote pedestrian safety in the main street. The proposal would mean the loss of car parks outside Oppies LGA and would restrict traffic to one lane at the crossing point.

<p>Wind Farms</p>
<p>The debate continues. A group of locals expressed their concerns recently on a Channel 7 news segment. The group wants all proposals deferred until all complaints have been investigated. Some Waterloo locals are also complaining about interference with radio and television signals. Mary Morris of Buchanan says the noise from the Waterloo wind farm can be heard up to 10 km away depending on wind conditions. One farmer 4.5 km from a turbine has moved to Kapunda in order to get some sleep. Another has moved to Saddleworth. Larger turbines than used at Hallett are due to be placed within 4.5 km of the township of Burra.</p>

<p>Sam Wilksch of Robertstown, who lives seven kilometres from the Waterloo wind farm, writes to support them and to say he cannot hear noise from them.</p>
<p>Cameron Garnsworthy, Senior Managers Renewables Development, TRUenergy, writes to complain that the large majority of wind farm supporters are being misinformed by a select few. He says they are cost effective and reliable. They provide local jobs and conform to strict noise guidelines. Independent tests show that at wind speeds up to 40 km per hour the sound at 1 km distance is below 40 decibels. If this level was a problem we would have to discard our refrigerators. For those concerned with facts TRUenergy has made a considerable amount of information available on its website. This includes all plans, noise assessments, visual diagrams and independent studies required for our proposed wind farm at Stony Gap. We have held an information day at Burra and we are the first wind farm operator in the Mid North to establish a Community Liaison Group.</p>
<p>Barbara MacMillan writes suggesting that the proposed pedestrian refuge in Commercial Street either goes to show the Council has a sense of humour or was mistakenly transferred from publication on 1 April.</p>
<p>Peter Edson, President of BRTBA, writes praising the organisers etc. associated with the Burra Monster Mine Spectacular and thanking all who gave their support to such a successful event. He also asks for any ideas that would assist in planning next year’s event.</p>

<p>Lynne Wilkinson CEO of Ausbuy writes on the subject of foreign ownership of Australian farms and stations.</p>
<p>Ken Grundy of Naracoorte writes expressing opposition to the inclusion of any mention of local government in the Constitution. It would be dangerous for the state governments to be bypassed and for there to be direct links between the Federal Government and local bodies. The issue goes far beyond funding, he asserts.</p>

<p>Burra Community School’s Bi-Annual Continental was held on Friday despite the searing heat. Numbers were large, though perhaps slightly lower than in previous years. Stalls and activities were spread around the school and focused on the theme of Rainbow Circus. The Burra CFS unit was a great hit with the younger visitors, with chances to hit orange traffic cones with the big hose. The bouncy castle and the rock wall were also popular. Painted faces, glow sticks, live music from Kerry Davy, show bags and food were all well patronised attractions. Thanks are extended to the Goyder Council for providing the jumping castle and the rock climbing wall.</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall is being re-roofed after more than a century. The work is expected to be completed within two weeks. The hall dates from 1874 and replaced an earlier and smaller building of 1857. A committee of civic minded residents had the building erected on land leased for 99 years on a peppercorn rent. The Miners’ and Mechanics’ Institute was designed to advance the moral, social and intellectual well being of residents and to offer improvements to the working classes. John Pearce of Burra was the contractor for much of the building we see today. There have been many changes and additions in the building’s history, including an interior facelift in 1969, a major re-development in 2001-02 and interior refurbishment in 2006. Trevor Woods, the Goyder Council’s Assets Manager, said the building was being re-roofed using Council funds after continuing leaks had damaged parts of the interior. Heritage Stone Restorations Ltd is rebuilding the stone wall on the southern boundary under contract to the Council. For years the building was the focal point for the town and housed the council office, served as a public meeting place and hosted a plethora of events, including dances, movies, concerts, operas and in 1889 opened as the Provincial Roller Skating Rink. It remains a landmark of the town’s historical commercial area. A worthy band of volunteers helps to maintain the building and surroundings. The Town Hall Committee spokesperson, Meredith Satchell, said they were delighted to see the building receive a new roof. [Photos]</p>

<p>Jack Kleinig was recently interviewed by representatives of the National Library of Australia who were in town to document old time dances and traditions. The Jack Kleinig Band played for more than 20 years in the local area before Mr Kleinig retired in the 1980s. The NLA has been recording the folklore, music, dance and poetry of Australia since the 1950s as part of their Oral History Collection. Their interest is not just in the dance and music, but in the dress, the suppers, the types and variations of dances and the stories of the people involved. Principal researcher is Rob Willis of Forbes NSW and he has been tracking down old performers to record their stories. Mr Willis has been a collector of folklore and social history since the mid 1970s. He has regular segments on ABC Radio and has assisted with TV documentaries. He said the interview with Jack Kleinig was great, ‘capturing many stories of the dance (and other) traditions in the area. Jack’s stories will be archived and be available to everyone in the Oral History section of the NLA and the material is also available on-line at the NLA site TROVE.http://trove.nla.gov.au/</p>

Shirley Broad had been President for 17 years and recalled the good times and the friendships over that period. The organisation began in 1978 when then BCS Principal Chris McCabe thought the town needed a Senior Citizens Club. He mentioned it to Edith Carpenter, Laurel Neill and another person, who spread the idea around town. Foundation members were Len &amp; Sue Hentschke, Laurel Neill and Beryl Kakoschke, with Mrs Kakoschke, who now lives in Wallaroo, being the only remaining original member. Before long there was a group meeting in the CWA rooms in Chapel Street, free of charge. Various speakers were arranged. Eventually Ray Jennison came along and a committee was formed. The group grew until it was too large for the CWA rooms and meetings were transferred to the Uniting Church Hall, also free of charge. A few months later when the Burra Council had completed renovations of the RSL Building, the Senior Citizens were offered the main meeting room for a place to gather. Len Bence offered a painting to be raffled. The money was to be towards a trip that never eventuated, but all funds went to projects around Burra. While the club provided social and recreational opportunities, a major project over the years has been the beautification of the banks of the Burra Creek.</p>

<p>Wind Farm Noise</p>
<p>AGL Energy says that tonality issues at Hallett 2 wind farm have been resolved. An independent specialist has assessed the success of the fix. Tests have shown there are no audible tones from the turbines at the nearest residence in all wind speeds.</p>
<p>Commercial Street Pedestrian Refuge</p>
<p>Goyder CEO, John Brak, answered some questions on the proposal. The design was a standard one used in city and country locations in SA. Its location maximises crossing for the supermarket and the Post Office and provides a fixed point for crossing rather than the randomness operating at present. It aims to achieve a safer crossing for the young, the old and the frail, especially safety from reversing vehicles. New kerb ramps are another advantage. At present it will only be installed if costs are met by the State Government under its safety program. There will be a loss of two parking spaces and the provision of a disabled parking space. A light controlled crossing would be more expensive, would be more disruptive to traffic, would occupy parking spaces and would not be likely to be funded by the Sate. Plans are on view in the Council office.</p>
<p>Ally Fricker for ‘Stop Industrial Windfarms’ writes to dispute the points made recently by Cameron Garnsworthy of TRU energy. She says the ‘independent’ noise consultants are not truly independent. Their business depends on the company’s business. Only a government appointed body could achieve a measure of independence. She disputes his other points as well.</p>

<p>Burra Visitor Centre now has a new access ramp and steps to improve access to the building. The ramp was built by local builder, Paul Wilson and replaces two large steps. The ramp includes a non-slip surface and a sturdy handrail and the design closely matches existing crossovers in Market Square. The cost is c. £36,500 ex GST. The project will be completed when an automatic door is installed and that is expected this month.</p>

<p>The Burra Railway</p>
<p>A petition seeking the return of passenger train services to Burra and the Mid North will soon be tabled in the SA Parliament. It carries over 1,000 signatures. Burra Motor Inn proprietors Paul Henley and Robert Frischke initiated the move. Even people who are pessimistic about the move think it would be a good idea. The petition has been circulated widely through the region. The reopening of the rail system would also have the potential to get some heavy vehicles off the roads. Many believe that rail is critical in getting more industry to establish itself in the region and thus to provide employment.</p>

<p>Fossil Festival Turns 10</p>
<p>As part of the celebrations a team of palaeontologists from the SA Museum will visit Burra.</p>
<p>On Monday 25 March BCS students will participate in workshops with three leading palaeontologists: Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University, Dr Aaron Camens of Flinders University &amp; Dr Trevor Worthy of Adelaide University. The discussion will explore Burra’s fossil heritage and contemporary issues such as climate change and extinctions.</p>
<p>On Monday evening there will be a free public Twilight Palaeo Talk at the Burra Town Hall at 7 p.m. and while there will be no set script, the talk will have reference to Burra’s fossil heritage and discoveries made by the three palaeontologists. The session should run to about 8.30 p.m.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the visitors will call in at Farrell Flat School to talk to students there. For ten years now the SA Museum has been hosting its own ‘Fossil Festival’ to celebrate the rich fossil history of the state and to foster awareness about why it matters.</p>

<p>Mrs M. Ironside of Burra writes complaining that a fall caused by an uneven paver in Commercial Street cost her a lot of pain, a trip to the Burra Hospital and then to the RAH, followed by the need to employ someone to do housework for some time. The cost all up was $80-$90 and her insurance company refused to pay up because no other falls had been reported.</p>
<p>Peter Brodie writes, concerned about the transfer of the title to the Burra Hospital is being transferred to the Lower North Health Advisory Council. This is a voluntary body with no authority and Burra has only minor representation on it. A public forum is being held to discuss this at the Burra sports Complex at 1 p.m. 26 March, before the next Lower North HAC meeting.</p>
<p>Des Woolley writes to praise the action taken by Council to help solve his drainage problems in the southeast corner of the town. He says the approach has been professional and the work of a high standard.</p>
<p>Don Lloyd and Claire Tiver write expressing their concern that the removal of large pepper trees (Schinus molle) across the district is ‘tearing a page from a history book’.

<p>Burra Hospital. The hospital’s X-ray machine is to be relocated to Victor Harbor despite views expressed at the Lower North Health Advisory Group on Monday. The machine was originally donated by the Gebhardt Trust according to the Group of Concerned Burra &amp; District Residents spokesperson Helen Szuty. The view expressed was that it should stay in Burra and that at Victor Harbor arrangements could be made with existing private providers. Ms Szuty expressed her disappointment that the advice of the meeting had not prevailed. There is a state-wide program for updating X-ray machines, but no indication yet as to when Burra’s would by replaced. The issue of the hospital’s title was also raised and the Lower North HAC agreed to look into the matter of the retention on the title of the clause:</p>
<p>‘In trust to permit suffer and be used at all times as a Hospital Reserve over Allotment 94 and the land marked X.’</p>
<p>Another matter raised was the resurfacing of the car-park.</p>
<p>The meeting was told that it is likely that a private dental practitioner will establish a practice at the Burra Hospital.</p>

<p>Senator Nick Xenophon spoke at a packed public forum at the Burra Town Hall on Thursday night. He urged the Goyder Council to seek ‘top shelf’ advice regarding wind farm development in the region. Several people relayed their concerns about ill health effects of wind turbines. The Senator said that Council should be supporting the community by getting independent legal advice on their rights to take on the SA Government and get independent testing done. Three Councillor including Mayor Mattey were present and Mr Mattey said ‘Council’s main objections are the changes made by the State Government to change the developments from Category 3 to Category 2 projects and ‘the inability on any non-owning landholders to make submissions to the DAP.’ With Senator Xenophon were Victorian Democratic Labour Senator John Madigan and SA Senator Alex Carracher and also acoustician Steven Cooper. Mr Cooper explained that the noise that troubles is not high pitched frequencies, but infrasound; low level thumping that penetrates the walls of a home. Varying pressure is also a problem. The proposed Stony Gap wind farm would be only 4.5 km from Burra.</p>

<p>Jackie Hart, A/Director Yorke &amp; Lower North Health Service, writes explaining that Burra’s X-ray machine has been temporarily relocated to Victor Harbor as a replacement for their broken machine of the same model. Country Health SA does not think this will create a problem as it has not been used in Burra since February 2010. Local GPs have been referring patients to Clare and Gawler or even Adelaide. The machine will return to Burra when Victor Harbor’s new machine is installed and that is due in May 2012.</p>
<p>Patrick Le Vagueresse writes re Burra Baseball Club Inc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately due to ill health I am forced to sell or close down the Burra Baseball Club Inc. After about five years and investing more than $12,000 of my own money, I have seen very little interest in either baseball or softball in Burra. If someone wishes to buy the club and continue, I would be happy to pass on contacts and to help with some school clinics. If this does not happen I will sell most of the assets separately at a later date.</p>

<p>Jo Gebhardt writes defending the culling of pepper trees and explaining why it should be done:</p>
<p>They have become a weed in many areas and are particularly damaging on the floodplains of the Burra Creek. They are a significant threat to native vegetation and some landowners are spending significant money to control them. Although it may be wonderful to contemplate that Chilean muleteers may have introduced them, we would have been better off if they had not, just as we do not now celebrate the introduction of species like Horehound, no matter how historic it may have been.</p>

<p>Marlene Wooton was farewelled recently after 33 years at the helm of Burra Day Care/Leisure Group at a luncheon at the centre. She has been a tireless worker and set up the Day Care at the Burra Hospital, where she volunteered for five years before becoming an employee of the Health Service. After a name change and several locations the Leisure Group was housed in the former Aberdeen Football Club rooms at Burra North. It became, in its day, the bench mark for SA, due to Mrs Wooton’s hard work. In 1997, Mrs Wooton was hand picked as one of six from SA to participate in a study, which then became policy. She has long been a strong advocate for the aged and people with disabilities and special needs. Many volunteers have joined her over the year. Over the years more than $75,000 has been raised towards improvements at the centre. In 2001 Mrs Wooton received SA’s first Arthur Cys’ Medal for service to senior. In 2010 she was a semi-finalist in the Rural Doctors Workforce Agency/Rural Community Health &amp; Well Being Award. In 2006 and 2009 the Burra Leisure Group were recipients of the Burra Australia Day Community Event of the Year Award. About 50 people attended the farewell lunch. Meryl White said grace.</p>

<p>Peter Brodie writes expressing concern at discovering that there has been no X-ray service at the Burra Hospital for the last 2 years. He goes back over the Dr Dissanayake saga and links the two issues. He says the three Burra Doctors have said they are all prepared to do whatever is necessary to gain or regain the authority to operate the X-ray machine. He suggests that the machine was rushed out of Burra before the doctors returned from leave at the weekend.</p>
<p>Peter Batten writes, concerned at the noise issues relating to wind farms as raised at the recent Burra meeting with Senator Xenophon.

<p>Nick Brooks, Burra Merchandise Manager for Elders was recently talking to a Burra client who had just returned after working for two months as a mine manager in Senegal. He said the company there was looking for a better deal on fencing. Nick jokingly suggested they ask Elders to quote, which they did and they won the deal. He has since had a lot to learn about the complexity of sending four container loads or 70 tonnes of fencing material overseas. He says that next time it will be easy. Most of the fencing was supplied by the Australian company Waratah.</p>

<p>Eichler family Reunion. Descendants of Carl Eichler recently gathered at the Burra Cemetery for the dedication of a memorial stone where he was buried on 14 April 1889. Pastor Graham Simmonds conducted the service. The family then visited a number of sites in the town associated with their ancestors and then met at the Burra Hotel for dinner, which was also attended by members of the Burra History Group. On Sunday there were visits to other sites of Burra’s heritage and a service at St John’s Lutheran Church. Carl Eichler and his wife Henriette with six children arrived in Burra in 1851 from Clausthal in Germany. Carl had been a miner all his life and the couple were both aged 40 when they migrated. Their eldest child, August, turned 15 soon after they arrived. Carl soon joined the gold rush to Victoria, but after three years returned to Burra to be employed at the Mine as a timberman. He stayed until the Mine closed in 1877. They owned properties in Illogan Street, and in Millerton. All the children survived to adulthood and their descendants are now scattered across Australia and New Zealand. Carl died 12 April 1889 aged 78 and Henriette on the same day 11 years later in 1900 aged 88.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital Title</p>
<p>The Group of Concerned Burra &amp; District residents have claimed victory over the transfer of the title from the Burra Burra Hospital Inc. to the Lower North Health Advisory Council retaining the existing schedule of endorsements to read ‘In trust to permit suffer and to be used at all times as a Hospital reserve over allotment 94 and the land marked X.’</p>
<p>Spokesperson Helen Szuty said that the decision will better protect the retention of Burra Hospital in the future as a public hospital.</p>

<p>The Dawn Service at Burra drew a crowd of about 100 on a wet and dark morning. No one complained about the drizzling rain. Numbers were down a little on the previous year, but the younger generation formed an appreciable proportion of those who came. Father Laurie Quinn conducted the service and Burra RSL President John Trigg recited the Ode of Remembrance. Afterwards all were welcome at the RSL Room for tea or coffee and the Commercial Hotel hosted breakfast for RSL members and families. RSL Treasurer Mike Thomas was pleased with the crowd that came despite the weather.</p>
<p>Present at the service from Sydney were ex-RAN servicemen Max Miller and John Jenkins, who were guests of Don Lloyd, having been classmates at Burra School many years ago.</p>
<p>Anzac Day Concert</p>
<p>An enthusiastic crowd filled the Burra Town Hall to hear the Burra Sing Australia Choir present an evening of war time songs last Wednesday evening. The choir was joined by members from Jamestown led by Chris Thomas (son of former Burra Uniting Church minister Malcolm Thomas).</p>
<p>Burra Branch of the Red Cross served tea, coffee and Anzac biscuits in the interval. Poems with an Anzac theme were read by Jan Tiver and Don Lloyd, while Nan Annells read a letter sent to his mother by a Burra digger in 1915. Burra choir director John Fuss said he was thrilled by the turnout, the reception received and the interaction with the audience. This was the choir’s first Anzac Day concert, but people have been asking for another. The proceeds from ticket sales and donations raised about $850, which is to be donated to Legacy.</p>
<p>Mary White, (Nee Lloyd) of Burra recalled being in the Volunteer Air Observation Corps in WWII as a Burra District air observer. This was a role she shared with her mother, Annie Lloyd. As a 13-year-old school girl she recalled leaving school to help her parents work on the farm about six miles northwest of Burra. He father was in the Volunteer Defence Corps and often away from home. Often planes were spotted while they were milking, some distance from the phone and she would run to the house to make the report to the Observation Post in Burra, which was operated by Patricia Pledge, Irene Hirschausen (nee Hogan) and Joan Sutton (nee Davies). The observation post was located behind the shops in the main street at the top of a tower.</p>
<p>[This ‘tower’ had been built in 1910 behind the then Burra Record office in Market Square. It was a three storey wood and iron structure designed as a photographic studio. It was destroyed by fire in December 1950. See Burra Record, VX, 897 (2), 13 July 1910, page 2, Burra Record VX, 902, 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 and Burra Record, 76, 50, 19 Dec. 1950, page 1.]</p>
<p>The code word when phoning in was ‘Queen Baker three’, but after two years it was changed to ‘Uncle Oboe eight’. The most common planes they identified were Tiger Moths and Wirroways (fighter). After the war they were presented with a certificate as a record in appreciation of their Patriotic Response to the Call of Country.</p>

<p>The 21st Burra Antique and Collectibles Fair was held last weekend. Burra was inundated with visitors. The event kicked off with a celebratory dinner on Friday night at the Bowling Club with traders, organisers and management committee in attendance. Fair co-ordinators were Leonie Ambler, Ken Jacobs and Paul Marsson. Market Square and best Place were alive with activity on Saturday morning and visitors formed a long queue at the Burra Town Hall. The fair was opened by radio personality and columnist Peter Goers. Visitors were entertained by pianist Bruce Leach. Traders were kept busy and so was the café area. The shuttle bus was well patronised. The Clare Concert Band also played on both days of the fair. Rusty Relics returned to the Treasure Trove performing a variety of country tunes and Tracey Rains and friends entertained visitors, busking at Patiennes Ice creamery at Burra North. While Sunday numbers were down a little, the traders were pleased with the success of the event. Leonie Ambler said in the six years of being at the helm the fair had grown significantly and there was increasing interest from interstate traders. Stalls had grown from 20 to 40. The fair was becoming one of the premier events of its kind in SA. Both the Town Hall and the school gym are almost fully booked for next year.

<p>Phoenix Copper reports excellent drilling results at its highly prospective Burra North Tenement. This follows a five-hole drilling program only 800 metres from the famous Monster Mine. Copper at 1.17% was found over 22 metres from 94 metres and there were areas of 7.92% and 4.73%. CEO James Fox says the results represent a major boost for the company, which will continue to work in a highly significant and yet under-explored area. These results provide a focus for exploration of the Monster Mine copper lode beyond the Reserve where mining is currently prohibited.</p>
<p>Adelaide based Phoenix Copper listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in February 2008 and is focused on the discovery of copper and gold within its 4,200 km2 exploration licence holding in SA. This includes the Burra Region and Yorke Peninsula, where it is currently conducting exploration drilling at its Minlaton project with two drilling rigs in operation.</p>

<p>BRTBA President Peter Edson says this month’s Antique Fair exceeded expectations and this has prompted a call for a sub-committee to maintain the success. The success brings a great benefit to our businesses and the whole community. Mr Edson paid tribute to the enormous effort put in by Ken Jacobs, Leonie Ambler and Paul Marsson. He said that with Leonie and Paul now stepping down it was up to all of us in the Burra Community to see that the event continues to be a success. BRTBA is now calling for people who are willing to step up and join the sub-committee to begin the organisation of the 2013 fair. The traders have already committed to returning next year and it is now up to the community to see that their commitment is matched by our own.</p>

<p>Johnny Green is the focus of a mobile phone adventure entitled ‘Who was Johnny Green’. It is a part-History, part-science and part-open air museum game and is played on 3G enabled smart devices. The research, design, direction and field testing has been largely undertaken by a group of middle school students at BCS. The adventure leads players through 13 different locations within Burra to help solve the mystery ‘Who was Johnny Green?’ Creative direction and project management was by Roger Edmonds, an educator specialising in online collaboration. Regional Council of Goyder tourism officer Jess Humphrys has been a facilitator for groups with support from the Burra Passport Committee, led by Councillor Jane Kellock. Text, audio, images and videos have been obtained from many sources, in particular from the State Library of SA and the Burra History Group website. [Further details are printed.]</p>
<p>Dan van Holst Pellekaan met with concerned community members at the White Cedars Café last Thursday, following a meeting earlier in the year. About 14 attended this meeting. Many issues raised were concerned with local government rather than the State Government he said.

<p>Camping at Princess Royal</p>
<p>A large group of members of the Australian CamperTrailers Group will enjoy a weekend of camping at Princess Royal 18-20 May. About 40-50 campers will attend. The group is a non profit organisation started in 2001 and provides a place for members to chat free of commercial advertising or promotions. On average members mostly live in Queensland, NSW and Victoria and most have full-time jobs. They are members of a 4WD club and have been camper-trailering for one to five years, having upgraded after camping with a tent. They prefer to bush camp with minimum amenities. Here they will be hosted by Mike and Leonie Fretwell, who are two of only a few SA members. They purchased their first camper trailer 22 years ago and at the time were very much the odd ones out.</p>

<p>Peter Brodie writes expressing his great concern over the transfer of the Burra Hospital Title to the Lower North</p>
<p>Health Advisory Council. He believes they have no authority and no assets apart from the Burra Hospital and all its assets. He believes Burra has less than one third of the representatives on the Council and the public is not welcome to its meetings. He is fearful that the Burra Hospital in the future will have even less management and community support that the Keith Hospital and could now be classed as a private hospital. He would be glad to be corrected about this matter.</p>
<p>Tania Neville writes expressing disappointment at the TRUenergy information days. The company she says appeared to dismiss all complaints and contrary views. In summary her view appears to be that the community consultation is mere window dressing.</p>

<p>The Eastern Pastoral survey of 1861-62</p>
<p>Although some land northeast of Burra had been taken up by pastoralists on ‘occupation leases’ before 1861, the Government got little money from such leases. A proper survey of the land would enable more accurate boundaries and the creation of more permanent tenure. In 1861 surveyor James Brook set out from an existing baseline and trig points in the hills northwest of Burra to complete a trigonometrical survey of the north eastern ‘waste lands’.</p>
<p>He surveyed north to Olary, west to near Quorn and east to the NSW border on Mutooroo Station. After six months he completed his task in June 1862. Locating drinkable water was a constant problem for the early surveyors. The result of his survey was the establishment of pastoral leases, some of them over more than 1,000 square miles and carrying tens of thousands of sheep. Using these trig points the town site locations for Yunta, Mannahill, Olary and the route to Broken Hill were also established.</p>
<p>In May 2012 retired Lands Department surveyor Paul Tucker decided to explore some of the original points in the Olary region, established by Brooks 150 years ago. Just south of Olary, Brooks established a baseline. Using a simple 100 link surveyor’s chain Brooks measured this line at 8.427 miles. At each end of this baseline he erected a permanent stone cairn six feet across and six feet high with a central pole eleven feet eight inches high. Though the centre poles have gone, the cairns remain. From these trig points the Lands Department surveyor Malcolm Butler established another trig point in 1951 for the surveying of Radium Hill uranium mining reserve. It was this point that Paul Tucker decided to find.</p>
<p>After many calculations and with friend Kevin Kakoschke deputising as his ‘chainman’ determined the spot where the pin marking the point should be. With the aid of a hand held GPS position fixing device they found the pin under eight inches of dirt. They went on to find other pegs of the Radium Hill Pioneer Cemetery and some associated with the old uranium mining reserve. They did, however, enjoy much more comfortable conditions and much better food than the original survey party.</p>

<p>Barkers of Baldina Aged Cottage Homes in Burra have installed a bore to provide water for the watering of the lawns at the Pearse Row site. It was located after Mr Ron Smedley pointed out a suitable spot to drill. It has appropriately been named Smedley’s Bore. Maynard Drilling of Clare carried out the drilling and tests showed the water to be of good quality. Further work done by M R Electrix and plumber David Nourse has allowed the bore to service all the pop-up sprinklers during the summer months. The cost will be recovered in savings to water usage charges over the next few years.</p>

<p>Helen Richardson has retired after serving 20 years delivering mail on the Hallett Gap-Willalo mail run. Helen started delivering mail in the late 1950s when the daily train would stop at the Ulooloo Rail Stop. When this stop was closed in the mid 1960s Helen began working in the Hallett Post Office and Exchange. Later she bought the building and the garage across the street, where she operated the service for at least 12 months. At the time five or six girls worked the exchange and the mail centre was a busy hub of activity. After that she spent her time on road deliveries of mail. Norma Mayne of Hallett has taken over the road delivery contract from this week.</p>

<p>Saltbush Closes</p>
<p>Saltbush Clothing Co.’s Burra store will close its doors for good on 31 July after more than 24 years in operation. It was begun in early 1988 by Elspeth and Graham Radford established the company from their farm just outside of Burra. When Elspeth was unable to buy hard-wearing and smart moleskin trousers and co-ordinating shirts for her two young sons, she made her own. Friends requested similar garments and the company grew from a cottage business to one producing more than 40,000 garments annually. They were retailed through 120 stores across Australia. They were also available by mail order from a website and from two retail outlets later opened in Adelaide and Victor Harbor. It 1995 they won the Telstra &amp; SA Government Small Business Award in the category for fewer than six employees. [The next paragraph repeats this information, but says they were finalists rather than the winners.] They were finalists in the 1995 Channel 9 Small Business Show Award and in 1996 Elspeth Radford was a finalist in the 1966 Telstra &amp; SA Government Business Woman of the Year Award. In 1996 The Saltbush Catalogue won a bronze medal in the National Print Awards. In 2000 the company won the SA Regional Tourism Award for retail and in 2001 Elspeth was again a finalist in the Telstra Business Woman of the Year Award. The business has developed a loyal customer base, but Elspeth said closing it was the right business decision. The total retail environment had changed and it was time to move on. When production moved off shore Elspeth personally visited the factories ensuring professional and ethical practices. Most production became off shore with specific companies. She said there had been a huge reduction in tourists coming through, even compared with last year, with only about 50% of the number to the same time. A final sale of fixtures and fittings will be held in mid August.</p>

<p>Eudunda Uniting Church</p>
<p>[There is an article to commemorate the closing service of the Eudunda Uniting Church building, though the ministry will continue in another format in other sites. From the late 1870s Wesleyan services were held in a building on the site of the present St John’s Lutheran Church, but the first resident minister was not appointed till 1885. In that year it was decided to build the present building at a cost of £250. Construction was completed in February 1888 and the building has been in use up to this closing service. A Sunday school was erected behind the church in 1960. It became the Uniting Church upon the amalgamation of the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches in June 1977. In the late 1970s the church was re-roofed and renovated internally.]</p>

<p>The Sesquicentenary of John McDouall Stuart’s crossing of Australia from south to north is being celebrated. It was 150 years yesterday that the explorer and his party reached the north coast of Australia to become the first Europeans to traverse the continent from south to north through the centre. Celebrations are planned at Port Stuart in the NT, at London, Adelaide and at Burra this weekend. On Friday evening a small exhibition of artefacts associated with the expedition has been arranged and will be opened at the Burra Regional Art Gallery, which is the site of the old Kooringa Telegraph Station. It was from here that Stuart sent a telegram announcing his success and his return. There will be a Morse demonstration. Margaret Blacker of the John McDouall Stuart Society will be the guest speaker in the evening and there will be a dinner at the Burra Hotel. On Saturday morning a small contingent of horses and riders will assemble at the Burra Pony Club for the re-enactment of Stuart’s arrival. The group with wagons will stop at Peacock’s Chimney before making their way to the Gallery where Morse code operators will re-enact the transmission of Stuart’s telegram. The team will then adjourn to the Showgrounds where The Burra Men’s Shed will provide a barbecue luncheon. There is already a plaque commemorating Stuart’s telegram, placed on the Art Gallery by the John McDouall Stuart Society in 1995, the Burra Jubilee 150 year.</p>

<p>The Centenary of John McDouall Stuart’s Crossing of the Continent was celebrated at Burra at the weekend. On Friday evening a small exhibition of items from the State Library and associated with the expedition was opened. John McDouall Stuart Society President Rick Moore was present and Margaret Blacker represented the State Library. Mr Des Ross of the Royal Caledonian society was the piper for the arrival of the haggis before the gathering adjourned to the Burra Hotel for dinner. Others present included three members of the Morse Code Fraternity: Lawrie Wallace (86), Ron Lee (84) and Bernie Matson (73) who were to play an important role in Saturday morning’s re-enactment.</p>
<p>Mr Wallace said the Stuart expedition played a vital role in the establishment of the Overland Telegraph between Adelaide and Darwin, which was completed in 1872, ten years after the expedition. This connected Australia to Java via undersea cable and from there to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning the arrival of Stuart in Burra was re-enacted. Trevor Alderson took the role of Stuart and Pauline Bevan took the part of Patrick Auld as they travelled from the Showgrounds to the old Telegraph Station (now the Art Gallery). Stuart, ill from scurvy, sent the following message: ‘John McDouall Stuart, commander of the South Australian Great Northern Exploring Expedition, to the Commissioner of Crown Lands. Kooringa, December 16, 1862. Through you, I beg to inform His Excellency the Governor in Chief and the Government that I have accomplished the object of the expedition. Party behind all well. I will be in town by the evening train tomorrow.’</p>
<p>The party then went on to Market Square where Peter Batten, in the role of W.H. Wilkinson read articles from the SA Register of 18 &amp; 20 December 1862, reporting Stuart’s arrival and reception in Kooringa (Burra). The party then returned to the Showgrounds where a barbecue was hosted by the Burra Men’s Shed to conclude the event.</p>

<p>Wind Farm Rejected</p>
<p>Regional Council of Goyder’s Development Assessment Panel rejected a major new Stony Gap Wind Farm proposal from TRUenergy, citing noise-related health issues as the reason when it met last Wednesday. This is the first wind farm proposal to be rejected by a council since the State Government’s legislation was passed in 2011. Concerns including sleep deprivation, low frequency noise and vibrations were to the fore, with complainants fearing the issues that have cause complaints from residents living near the Waterloo Wind Farm. Elected members of the panel Crs Peter Dunn and Jane Kellock were not convinced by the answers supplied by TRUenergy and with the support of Mei Lin Schwarz the proposal was rejected 3 to 2.</p>
<p>TRUenergy will now consider its options.</p>

Initial projects include ‘Mid North Demographic Destinies: research examining the future populations of settlements across the regions. In tourism research will examine the capacity of local businesses to adapt to changing market conditions. There is an International Exchange Agreement with the University of Applied Sciences, Krems, Austria.

<p>TRUenergy will appeal against the local council’s decision to reject planning approval for the Stony Gap wind Farm development. The proposed $300 million development would be located 125 km [sic] north of Adelaide near Burra. [Burra is c. 155 km from Adelaide in a straight line] It would provide 123 MW of energy to power the equivalent of more than 75,000 homes each year. TRUenergy will appeal to the SA Environment, Resources and Development Court. Cameron Garnsworthy for the company said they believe the development met all state planning requirements and this view was supported by the Goyder Regional Council’s independent planning consultant, who recommended the development should proceed.</p>

<p>Raymond &amp; Susan Parker write to express their opposition to the proposal by the National Trust branch in Burra to sell Kotz Cottage:</p>
<p>The heritage Branch and NTSA spent nearly $10,000 stabilising the cottage in 2008. We believe the cottage should be retained and renovated as funds become available for several reasons. There is an enormous amount of information, including photographs, about the various residents of the cottage, which was occupied by the Voumard family for many of its early years. There are members of this family still living in the Mid North. Its place in the development of Burra once mining was no longer the primary industry is irreplaceable as it demonstrates the emergence of agriculture within the Mid North region.</p>

<p>Goyder Regional Council has donated two hectares of land near Burra to the Russian Molokan Christian Community for use as burial plots. The Community believes that once a member is buried the ground must remain undisturbed for eternity. Most cemeteries in SA have leases of between 50 and 99 years. The Community was seeking land for an estimated 500 burials by the end of this century. The Council recently decided to transfer ownership of assessment A51390 (CT277/138) in the Hundred of Bright to the Russian Molokan Community.</p>

<p>Ruth Norris, Burra’s resident Animal Rescue and Care Officer, has been short listed as a finalist in the 2012 Pride of Australia Awards for untiring and selfless environment work in the community. She is well known in the community as the person to call when finding a sick or injured animal. It is not unusual for her to receive up to five calls a day regarding animals. She is supported by her children and husband Stuart. She attends call outs for kangaroos, eagles, hawks, owls, echidnas, lizards and more. She assesses the animals, checks for pouch young and drives them to a vet if she thinks they can be saved or they are mercifully euthanased. Some are released into the wild after rehabilitation. In 2006 Ruth was headhunted by the RSPCA to become an Honorary Inspector for the Mid North. Due to the demand for services the couple have spent more than $10,000 of their own money on caging facilities. After 41⁄2 years the RSPCA decided to abolish the honorary positions due to legislation. Ruth and Stuart have continued the service and began their own Animal Rescue &amp; Care Incorporated Association from November 2011. This involves liaison with SES, police, CFS, Regional Councils, the Department of Environment &amp; Natural Resources, local vets, etc. to ensure the best outcomes for animals. Ruth became an International Horse Riding Instructor in the 1980s and studied Animal Attending at Gilles Plains TAFE in 2004, where she was the Student of the Year. She is also a qualified Equine, Small Animal and Human Bowen Therapist. She is currently studying a BSc full time at the University of New England, majoring in Zoology. Ruth’s nomination was submitted by Stuart with support from Goyder Council, Burra Police, DENR, Clare Animal Health and Clare Veterinary Clinic. The winners will be selected at a Pride of Australia Ceremony to be held in Adelaide in September.</p>

<p>AGL Energy Ltd has announced that it is looking to develop a new proposal for a 33 turbine wind farm near Hallett that will include more economic wind turbine technology. AGL earlier made a commercial decision not to proceed with the development previous approved in mid 2009. There is currently an appeal before the ERD Court. The ERD upheld the planning consent in November 2010. AGL is seeking to cease legal proceedings and to develop a new proposal that would incorporate large and more efficient turbines. The Hallett community remains an important region for AGL and since 2006 their community fund has injected $242,000 into local projects. The company currently has five wind farms operating in SA with others under development.</p>

<p>B. MacMillan, Secretary of the Burra Branch of the National Trust writes re the proposed sale of Kotz Cottage and in reply to Raymond and Susan Parker:</p>
<p>When Susan and Raymond were chairman/president and secretary of the Burra Branch they faced the same problem we face to day in relation to Kotz Cottage and that is the lack of funds needed to restore and maintain it. In Burra the Trust maintains the Redruth Gaol, the Police House, the Police Lockup, the old Court House, the Bon Accord Cottage, The Bon Accord Fire Engine Museum, The Bon Accord Engine Shed, the Dugouts and the Market Square Museum. Some paid guides and maintenance staff are employed on very limited hours. Government Grants, while available for some specific purposes, are in amounts not suitable for the scale of building restoration required at Kotz Cottage. Given our very limited income some cuts had to be made and unfortunately Kotz Cottage is one of them. We would welcome any constructive criticism and any suggestions re the saving of the cottage.</p>

<p>Lewis Family Reunion</p>
<p>Eighty-five descendants of the Hon. John Lewis came from all over the world for a family reunion in Burra last weekend.</p>
<p>John Lewis [born 1842 at Brighton SA] was privately educated until age 12 when he began working on the family farm at Balaklava. At 14 he ran away from home to become an apprentice blacksmith at Meadows before working on stations throughout SA. In 1872 he went to the NT where he obtained a lease on the Coburg Peninsula. He was commissioned by the Government as a courier between the construction parties on the northern and southern ends of the Overland Telegraph. He organised prospecting expeditions and Pine Creek Gold Reef was the chief find. On returning to SA he married Martha Anne Brook [September 1876] and they settled at Burra where with William Lister and James Shakes they formed the stock and station agency of Bagot, Shakes and Lewis. He conducted huge stock sales, once disposing of 47,000 sheep and 1,200 cattle. He served for three years in the [Town Council: December 1879-November 1981]. He was prominent in local organisations. The family had six children:</p>
<p>James Brook Lewis: a surgeon who also worked in Gwalior with geologist Herbert Hoover, late US President.</p>
<p>Gilbert Norman Lewis.</p>
<p>Essington Lewis.</p>
<p>Eleanor [Mary] Lewis.</p>
<p>[Jane] Florence.</p>
<p>Lancelot [Ashley] Lewis.</p>
<p>The family reunion has been a long time in the planning and owes much to the work of a great-granddaughter of John; Bronwyn Lewis. Much work on the family tree has been done by Bob Lewis; a son of Essington and by Sandy Lewis; the Hon. A.A. Lewis, a WA politician and son of Lance Lewis. Bronwyn thought it was time to act as Bob had died and few of his generation were still alive. A year of work saw 85 gathered at the Burra Town Hall representing four generations of the family.</p>
<p>John Lewis’s Children:</p>
<p>James Brook Lewis was known as Brook and studied medicine at the University of Adelaide and at Melbourne to complete his Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery. He went to WA where he worked in the wheat belt and on the goldfields and was doctor at Gwalia when Herbert Hoover was overseer of the mines there before returning to the USA and becoming President.</p>
<p>Gilbert Norman Lewis farmed at ‘Bundaleer’ before becoming a Major in the Indian Army and a champion polo player. He later bought land in WA from where his great-grandson, Nick Trethowan, spoke of being the fourth generation on ‘Balgarup’ in Kojonup. He was a great horseman and polo player. His great grandson, Peter Trethowan, has been a professional polo player.</p>
<p>Essington Lewis was officially recognised at the centenary of Federation celebrations as one of the 100 most influential Australians. He is the subject of Geoffrey Blainey’s book Man of Steel and John O’Donoghue’s play I am Work. He was Managing Director of BHP and in WWII Director General of Munitions.</p>
<p>Eleanor (Nell) Lewis served as a nurse in WWI. She later married George Cowan.</p>
<p>Florence (Jane) Lewis stayed in the Clare Valley and married Alec Melrose. Their wedding present was ‘Kadlunga’ where the fourth generation of Lewis descendants still live.</p>
<p>Lancelot (Ashley) Lewis died aged 52 but still made his mark. At 9 he rode alone from Burra to Adelaide and at 12 he made a journey from Burra to Warrnambool. He served in WWI [where he was severely wounded. He worked for Bagot, Shakes &amp; Lewis and later was Managing Director of Goldsbrough, Mort &amp; Co. Ltd with which Bagot, Shakes &amp; Lewis merged.]</p>
<p>As part of the family reunion visits were also arranged to ‘Richmond Park’ at Balaklava; the home of James and Eliza Lewis, the parents of John Lewis. And also to ‘Benacre’ at Glen Osmond, where John Lewis lived and which remained in the family for some 70 years until the death of Lance Lewis’s widow in 1969. [Actually 23 May 1968.]</p>
<p>On the Sunday night a presentation was made to the Norwood Football Club as both Essington and Lance were in the Champions of Australia team in 1908.</p>
<p>The whole weekend was rounded off with a trip to Kangaroo Island to see where the great great grandparents arrived and ran the Kangaroo Island Post Office before the Proclamation of SA said Bronwyn Lewis.</p>

<p>Don Lloyd writes to deplore the destruction of century-old pine trees in Burra.</p>
<p>A beautiful golden cypress wind break at the end of Bridge Terrace has gone. A 10 metre pine (not an Aleppo) was removed last week and other from various places around town have gone too. It seems anything not a eucalypt is in danger. Why has nothing been done to tidy up the trees damaged by galahs around the town?</p>
<p>Clair Tiver writes on the same issue.</p>
<p>A 150-year-old pine was levelled in Bridge Street East last Wednesday on the excuse its roots were interfering with drains. It is strange it should suddenly cause such problems after 150 years. ‘Trees as well as buildings tell us so much about our pioneers, their homesickness at planting trees familiar to them and in respect to them I argue that trees should be left to give that uniqueness, so evident in Burra.’</p>
<p>[150 years is probably something of an exaggeration. Photographs of the town in the 1870s reveal almost no trees at all. Plantings were undertaken from the 1880s onwards, following the establishment of the Town Council, nevertheless, this hardly alters the argument.]</p>

<p>Fire. The southern end of Burra was blanketed by smoke just after 2 p.m. last Tuesday when dry reeds along Burra Creek caught fire. The Burra CFS unit responded as the flames moved towards Cook O&rsquo;Burra snack bar and the Burra Hotel. The historic jinker was also located just above the creek line where great heat could be felt. Other fire units also responded and no property damage resulted.</p>

<p>Stephen Holder, a great grandson of Sir Frederick William Holder, and his wife Gale travelled from New Mexico to Australia to meet relatives and visit the town where his ancestor had played such an important role. Stephen’s grandfather was born in Kooringa in 1882, the third of eight children to Sir Frederick and his wife Julia, nee Stephens. During their two day visit the couple were treated to a fine dinner at the Burra Town Hall hosted by the Burra History Group and the Town Hall Committee and on Friday morning Stephen unveiled the recently erected plaque in Holder Garden on Chapel Street. Burra History Group president Meredith Satchell co-ordinated the visit and said that F.W. Holder was an unsung hero of the town. She could think of no other Burra resident who was so involved with community activities and who rose to such important positions in SA and Federal Governments. He was born in Happy Valley SA 1850 and died in Melbourne in 1909. In 1875 he came to Burra as a teacher and subsequently was a shopkeeper and manager, owner and editor of the Burra Record from 1880-90. He was also an architect, JP and coroner. While in Burra he was a local preacher, and took a prominent part in the Burra Parliamentary Club, Burra Young Men’s United Association, the Rifle Club, Burra Floricultural Society and the Burra School Board of Advice. He instigated the Burra Volunteer Rifle Company and at one time was chairman of the Burra Institute Committee, Burra Mutual Improvement Association, IOR Friendly Society, the Temperance Movement in Burra and the Redruth Band of Hope. He also acted as Curator of the Cemetery, Secretary of the Local Board of Health and Town Clerk. He found time to be Secretary or Treasurer of the Chinese Famine Relief Committee and the Burra Show Committee and was later Patron of the Cricket and Football Clubs. He was Mayor in 1887 &amp; 1889 and in 1887 was elected to the SA House of Assembly for the District of Burra. He left Burra in 1891, but continued as its MP until transferring to the Federal Parliament in 1901. He was SA Premier in 1892 and 1899-1901 and also served as the Treasurer. He was elected Speaker of the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901 and held that office till his death.</p>

<p>The World Copper Project will see delegates from around the world converge on Burra next week for a conference. It will bring together scholars who are working on the history of the copper industry and its heritage. Last year’s conference was held at Swansea and in 2013 a conference will be held at Santiago in Chile. Between 1830 and 1870 the Swansea district in South Wales became the hub of the world’s first globally integrated heavy industry. The copper smelters there often accounted for 50% of the world’s output in those decades. The Economic and Social Research Council awarded Swansea University and its partners £95,000 to raise awareness of the rich heritage of a once famed Welsh copper industry. This is being done through a travelling exhibition, websites, social media, 3D animations and a host of events.</p>
<p>[Conference speakers are then listed.]</p>
<p>The workshops in Burra will include visits to the miners’ dugouts, the Mine Store, the Burra Smelting Works site and other areas.</p>

<p>The Teliqua Lizard Crawl drew 61 participants to see pygmy bluetongues. Four plots were examined and each of the four groups examined each plot. The weather was rather cold and windy and this meant that the lizards were in their holes rather than basking outside. An average of 25 lizards was located by each group over the four plots compared with 32 located by the experts. Everyone got a good look at the lizards in their holes using optical fibrescopes.</p>
<p>Eunice Baker writes complaining of the uneven footpath paving in Burra, which resulted in her falling for the third time in market Square.

<p>The 2012 World Day of Copper saw a successful three-day conference at Burra.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion focused on the rise of Swansea as a smelting centre in the nineteenth century, (known as the Swansea moment) which led to the globalisation of copper mining. Several guest presenters and experts delivered papers at the Burra Town Hall, including:</p>
<p>Peter Bell of Flinders University: The early development of copper smelting in Australia.</p>
<p>Chris Evans of the University of Glamorgan: African slaves and Chinese indentured labourers in the services of Swansea Copper.</p>
<p>Luis Ortega of the University of Santiago, Chile: Copper mining and labour during the industry’s golden age and its downfall, 1840-85.</p>
<p>David Bannear of Heritage Victoria: The Burra Smelting Works.</p>
<p>Katherine Morrisey of the University of Arizona: The environmental impacts of the Swansea moment.</p>
<p>Bill Jones of the University of Cardiff: Cross-cultural encounters; Welsh copper workers in Chile during the Swansea moment.</p>
<p>Members of the public were invited to attend.</p>
<p>Greg Drew senior geologist and author of Discovering Historic Burra led a tour of the Kapunda Mine before the party arrived in Burra. He also gave a presentation on Leyshon Jones, father and son, Welsh smeltermen who dominated the SA smelting scene 1848-55.</p>
<p>The Burra workshop included tours of the Burra Mine, the Mine Store, the Smelting Works and dugouts, while the post conference tour took in Kadina.</p>

<p>Thr Burra Show last Saturday was opened by Mr Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP, Member for Stuart. A new attraction this year was Adrian Harry’s XTreme Trials, which drew big crowds for each of three scheduled performances. The Ute Muster was popular, with 20 entries. The floral display was excellent. Organising Committee President John Oates said that is was a great success and numbers attending were up on the previous year. There were 27 entrants in the shearing contest, which was the highest number for 12 years. Poultry and pigeons made a return, thanks to co-ordination by Brett &amp; Laura Jones. Food stalls were well patronised throughout the day. Mr Oates said there was increasing interest from exhibitors and people outside the district.</p>

<p>Marie Abbott celebrated her 100th birthday on 23 October. A family party was held at her daughter Mary’s home in Adelaide. Mrs Abbott made the delicious scones for the occasion. Among the acknowledgements were letters from the Queen, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other Parliamentarians. There was also a papal blessing from Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>Mrs Abbot was born Marie Hogan at Leighton on 23 October 1912. She attended Leighton Primary School until the age of 10 and then went to St Joseph’s Convent in Spalding, where she also learnt to play violin and piano. She went to school by horse and cart. Later she went on to teach music, mostly in the Booborowie area and often travelled to lessons by horse and sulky. Mrs Abbott played the church organ until she was 90. She fondly remembers sing-a-longs around the piano in the days before television or radio. She also recalls when the evening entertainment was often bridge or euchre around the table or going to her grandparents’ house to listen to concerts on the wireless or to neighbour’s houses to listen to the match commentary when Australia played England for the Ashes. She finds the biggest changes in her lifetime were the result of cars, telephones and electricity. When she was first married she lived in an uninsulated prefab house that was very hot in summer. There was neither a fridge nor a washing machine and the fire had to be lit to get any hot water. After the birth of their third child they got a kerosene refrigerator.</p>

<p>Burra Creek. After residents objected to the widespread us of pesticide the maintenance of the creek area is now in community hands. Council proposed that the Burra CMC devise a management plan and this resulted in the formation of the Burra Revegetation Group. Arrangements have been made with Council for a systematic slashing and reduced spraying of the area. The group is still working out how to divide the responsibilities between it and the Council and for access to funding. It is likely that the outcome will be cost saving for the Council and also result in a much nicer environment.</p>

<p>Burra Bumper Quiz Night will be held in the Burra Town Hall 16 November. It aims to raise funds for the ongoing renovations of the Burra Railway Station. Tickets are $10 per person. There will also be a lottery with just 100 tickets at $50 each. First prize is $1,000. The railway station is an example of the stunning work of volunteer Roy Taplin, who was responsible for the magnificent makeover of the Town Hall. People will be able to see the work he has done by visiting the railway station for morning tea on Saturday 17 November. He has transformed the eastern rooms from being full of pigeon droppings and white ants into what will shortly be an inhabitable space. He has made kitchen cupboards from recycled floor boards and so saved thousands of dollars. The Burra Railway Station Working Party will host the quiz. When finished the station will become an interpretive centre for the history of Burra and the railway station, will house a pigmy bluetongue display, and house bed and breakfast accommodation. Flinders University Archaeology Department and the SA Museum are committed to a display of the ancient mega-fauna of the region and Ngadjuri elder Vincent Copley is working to secure funding for a Ngadjuri Interpretive Display. The Burra History group expect to have a room featuring the history of the building and the railway. The Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure are taking over the lease of the building from Genesee and Wyoming Australia.</p>

<p>Goyder Council has slashed entry fees for its swimming pools for this season. Community feedback suggested high fees last season reduced pool use. Fees have fallen from $4.50 for adults and $3.50 per child for each session to $2 per person with no concessions or monthly tickets. The Council has more than $1 million invested in upgrading the Burra &amp; Eudunda pools and is seeking to encourage public usage. The opening of the refurbished Eudunda Pool will be delayed to 8 December to enable finishing touches to be completed. Relocation of the plant room and the discovery of a significant leak around the pool plug were major factors in the delay.

<p>Dr Dharma Dissanayake has been cleared of any misconduct at Burra Hospital after along legal battle with Country Health SA Local Health Network. In April 2010 Country Health terminated the services of Dr Dissanayake at Burra hospital, citing the absence of necessary credentials as the reason. Since then Dr Dissanayake and her husband Dr Fernando have continued their Burra practice while tending to legal proceedings against Country Health. Country health has now issued a formal apology to the doctor. The apology acknowledges that Dr Dissanayake was not afforded procedural fairness and that the decision to suspend her credentials should not have been made. Both Dr Dissanayake and her husband are now consulting at the Burra Hospital with the full support of hospital staff and management. Dr Chapman for Country health says in the apology that Dr Dissanayake’s credentials were reinstated in September 2011.</p>

<p>Merrie Elliott of Burra wrote re the death of Evan Hawke, expressing the respect she had for him as a result of his participation in the group of concerned citizens that stood up to do something in April 2012 when Dr Dharma had her attending rights to accidents and emergencies at the Burra Hospital removed by Country Health. He refused to be intimidated by the bureaucracy and like the rest of the group refused to cave in to their overbearing pressure. [The rest of her letter goes on about Country Health and the doctors.]</p>
<p>An anonymous writer also writes re Evan, describing him as one of life’s characters. Evan liked to think, to philosophise and to explore those ideas through poetry, paintings and sculptures. He had a great memory for connections between people and was a very generous person who contributed greatly to a number of Burra’s volunteer groups. He will be greatly missed at the Burra Art Group gatherings, at the Burra Regional Art Gallery and at the Men’s Shed.</p>

<p>Historic Unveiling of the First Kooringa Cemetery</p>
<p>Yesterday morning a small group of people gathered for the unveiling of the newly restored original Kooringa Cemetery. This is located at the end of Chapel Street and has long been hidden from most people’s knowledge except for history buffs and researchers. A meeting about three years ago it was decided to see the site restored. Roger and Jenny Cross undertook extensive research to uncover its history and there was a degree of heavier work in shifting rocks, laying pathways and clearing weeds.</p>
<p>In the process items from the original site that were washed into Burra Creek by wild floods in the 1850s were recovered, including part of a wooden cross that features in the construction of the shelter.</p>
<p>Jenny Cross discovered that the cemetery is possibly home to more than 150 graves, the majority being children and infants.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the grave of Thomas Pickett, the discoverer of the Burra Mine, who died in 1851 and also rests in the First Kooringa Cemetery.</p>
<p>At the time of his death Pickett was no afforded a decent funeral by the SA Mining Association, but rather through the efforts of the licensee of the Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel). He was reimbursed the following month by the Association.</p>
<p>The site contains several graves all facing west, with pathways to Pickett’s grave and also a memorial stone in recognition of the workers, workers’ wives and children who were not recognised by the Mining Association.</p>
<p>The three information boards contain a brief history of the old and new cemeteries and a list of the names of those buried at the first cemetery.</p>
<p>Jenny Cross gave an informative address. She touched on the lives of the people who created the town and in particular referred to Henry Ayers, Kingston who designed some of its cottages and Mortlock who made much money from the mine and started life as publican in the Burra Hotel. Of course the people who really made Burra were the workforce; those who laboured for the Mining Association and suffered on behalf of the Monster Mine. Research shows that from 1845 to about 1850 at least 150 people died. It is likely that most if not all of them are buried here. The memorial headstone is in recognition of these people who have no recognition other than this.</p>
<p>Goyder Council CEO John Brak had the honour of unveiling the shelter with the story boards. The first Kooringa Cemetery is open to the public and it is hoped it will soon be included on the Burra Heritage Passport Trail. [4 Photos]</p>
<p>[A number of the statements above that are framed in a quite positive format should be stated rather more tentatively. They rest on information that is suggestive rather than conclusive.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to place a date on which floods swept items into the Burra Creek.</p>
<p>The list of those possibly interred in the cemetery is quite sensibly derived from registration of deaths records. For this period those records do not record the place of death. They are records for ‘The District of the Murray’, which covered a large area of the north and east of SA. Kooringa was the only large settlement and so it is reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of those deaths occurred there and that the burials were in this cemetery.</p>
<p>Pickett’s grave is rather speculative. He died in November 1851 when the new cemetery might have been used. There is a tradition that he is buried in the old cemetery, but no conclusive evidence.</p>
<p>The identification of grave sites at the old cemetery requires more work and it is only to be hoped that those enhanced in the recent work have been correctly identified and delineated. ]</p>

<p>Friends of Burra Parks looked back on a rewarding year at their AGM on 30 January at La Pecora Nera. This year they got 8 km of fencing done at Mokota Conservation Park, which will allow sheep grazing trials in a native grassland system. In September there was a talk by guest speaker and senior geologist Wolfgang Preiss as the group walked through Tooralie Gorge. Other monthly activities saw members visiting the Pandappa, Paradise and Redbanks Conservation Parks and some also visited the Arid Lands Bimbowrie Conservation Park. Wendy Cliff who was senior ranger at Burra Parks will now be based at Clare as Community Ranger. Another ranger will soon be appointed. [Group photo &amp; Tooralie Gorge photo.]</p>
<p>The EPA will monitor low frequency noise at the Waterloo Wind Farm in April. Associate Professor Dr Con Doolan from the University of Adelaide’s School of Mechanical Engineering reported on tests conducted inside homes within a few kilometres of turbines. The report by Dr Doolan states that there is a close connection between the resident’s episodic symptoms of annoyance and certain low frequencies. He said monitoring would be undertaken to determine if current wind farm guidelines gave adequate consideration to noise issues. Not everyone is affected, but some people are greatly affected and appear to have significant issues with them. We are trying to understand that better.</p>

<p>The 2013 Monster Mine Spectacular was held on Saturday last. It is reported as the biggest party of the year. There was a capacity crowd. The dance floor was filled to the music of ‘The Fabulous Five’ and ‘Fever’ who played favourites from the 60s, 70s and 80s with great energy. The meal was outsourced to Reni Boston of Burra Fresh and there was plenty of favourable feed back. President Chris Harris said the event was a wonderful success. The bands marvelled at the outdoor setting and said they would love to come back again. Craig and the SuperSound gang did a great job with the sound and the lighting and the committee were delighted with the sponsorship from local business. The committee would welcome some younger people to their ranks.</p>

<p>Burra Cultural Heritage and Recreational Precinct has moved a step closer to getting funding for a major redevelopment project, in moving to round four of the Regional Development Australia Fund. The project would embrace five areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Skate Park in the area across the road from the Town Hall and Regional Art Gallery.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 &amp; 3. Burra Regional Art Gallery &amp; Town Hall – landscaping, paving and disabled access serving the two buildings.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Jinker and Boardwalk – a new structure over the jinker and a boardwalk linking the jinker to Ursula Street along the western side of Burra Creek.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pedestrian refuge in Commercial Street.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ratepayers’ Action Group has called a public meeting in the Burra Town Hall at 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday 27 February to discuss rates and representation. State MP for Stuart Dan van Holst Pellekaan has been invited to host the meeting. Community representatives who were members of the Council’s Rate Review Committee were invited to attend and Councillors, but the latter have so far declined to do so. One of the issues is the parity of rating for Burra and Eudunda ratepayers. This has been mentioned in modelling a number of times, but there is no mention of it in the Rating Review Report. The Council is going through the minimum public consultation required under the Local Government Act 1999. RAG urges ratepayers to attend and also to write submissions on issues to Council by 3 p.m. 1 March.</p>
<p>The Burra Section of Sing Australia hosted the regional gathering of choirs on Saturday last at Burra Town Hall. More than 100 members from Campbelltown, Jamestown, Orroroo, Glenelg, Gawler, Peterborough, Port Pirie, Adelaide, Kadina and Burra attended. General Manager of Sing Australia, Colin Slater attended along with deputy director Margaret Slater from Melbourne. The meeting discussed problems facing country choirs, such as how to recruit members and the lack of accompanists. The organisation has 6,000 members nationally. The Burra group meets at 7 p.m. on Wednesday s in St Mary’s Parish Hall, led by John Fuss. After the meeting there was a lunch followed by two hours of singing and vocal training.</p>
<p>Tania Auhl writes concerning the copyright of the books written by her father concerning Burra. She feels it is a shame to see these go out of print, but approaches to the local Council to get them to buy the copyright have been unsuccessful. She feels the copyright really belongs to the people of Burra.</p>

<p>The ‘Midnight Oil’ House just north of Burra has become famous for the many photographs of it that have appeared across Australia. Now this building that has become an icon of the Mid North is in danger of structural collapse after a rear corner of it fell down. A restoration fund has been set up to save the structure. While privately owned by the Stockman family it has become a most recognisable symbol of settlement in this area of SA. The cottage dates from the period 1915-20. Its image can be found at Adelaide Airport and at Dubai and in countless tourism and heritage promotions. Bruce Stockman is the project facilitator. Architectural advice urges stabilising the roof as soon as possible. A local builder and mason have been organised and materials have been sourced, but funds are needed. The building came to widespread notice after it featured as the cover picture on the Midnight Oil band’s Diesel and Dust album in 1987. Donations can be made to the Burra Branch of BankSA to the Midnight Oil Cottage Preservation Fund. [Photo]</p>

<p>Professor Andrew Millington &amp; Dr David Bass of Flinders University met with members of the Burra Revegetation Group and the Goyder Council last Thursday to discuss educational opportunities in the revegetation of Burra Creek. The group approached the University to get some help with questions that arose when replanting was being undertaken: where to plant, what to plant, what about floods, what would people most enjoy etc. Council CEO John Brak said that one hope was that the project would reduce Council’s maintenance costs in the long term, thus freeing funds for the further development of the area.

<p>Burra Uniting Church held its annual Pancake Day last Tuesday. Traditionally this activity on Shrove Tuesday used up the household’s fat, eggs and dairy produce before the start of lent and the time of abstinence associated with it. Funds raised go towards helping families in need across Australia.</p>
<p>Ski For Life is an event that will involve a combined 500 km water ski from Renmark to Murray Bridge. The sponsored run will raise money for increasing awareness in the community of depression and suicide. Local Burra man Bill Stockman is one of the main drivers behind the event. As Chairman of Men’s Watch he has taken a strong interest in mental health. He also has a personal connection with the program, having suffered depression off and on since childhood, after he was involved in a shooting accident that took the life of his friend aged 14. After the breakdown of his marriage several years ago he was isolated and living alone and attempted suicide. After this event and being hospitalised for a period he took an interest in the program to raise awareness of the problem of suicide, especially as it related to men, who account for some 78% of suicide deaths in Australia. There is a special problem in rural communities due to isolation and lack of mental health service. [Photo]</p>

<p>Wolf Creek 2 is filming in Burra. The principal photography for this movie began in SA in January and next week will continue in Burra. A crew of about 50 will be in town, including the stars of the film John Jarratt, who is again taking the role of the sadistic Mick Taylor and Ryan Corr from Packed to the Rafters.

She said the majority of filming in Burra would be done over three days. This sequel comes seven years after the first Wolf Creek hit international screens. It opened in Australia in November 2005 and took $1.22 million in its first week. In the UK it was given a modest release in September 2005 and grossed £1.5 million. In the USA it opened on Christmas Day 2005 and grossed $16,188,180 on American screens. Elsewhere overseas it garnered $11,574,468 to bring in a gross total of $27,762,648.</p>

<p>A Public Meeting was held at Burra Town Hall last Wednesday to discuss rates and representation. Only a small number of ratepayers attended. It was organised by the Ratepayers Action Group and chaired by the Member for Stuart Mr Dan van Holst Pellekaan. RAG spokesperson Helen Szuty said although it was disappointing to see such a small turnout, it was more disappointing to see no Council members present. Elected member, city of Burnside 2003-10, Jim Jacobsen was guest speaker and gave a clear overview of Council’s Rating Review Report. Mr Jacobsen said there were clear communication issues between the Council and ratepayers.</p>

<p>I spoke with Goyder Council last September about the possibility that four local businesses could close. I asked what Council would do about that and suggested that resurrecting something like the Yacht Club would bring people to the town. For this the creek needed to be cleaned out. £33,000 was allocated to this task. The reeds were poisoned and I expected some follow-up, but nothing has been done. The £33,000 can go back to consolidated revenue if there is no action. The Council seems to have a policy of procrastination until projects wither and die.</p>

<p>A full page of advertisements announces the relocation of Goyder Auto Service to Best Place Burra North. Toni Gisi has more than 35 years’ experience servicing all makes of cars and more than 20 years servicing Mercedes Benz. He began his apprenticeship working for his father, Vic Gisi, in the premises in Thames Street now La Pecora Nera. He later went on to manage Goyder Auto Service located behind the Burra BP for almost 10 years. A need for expansion prompted the purchase of a new site at Best Place in 2012 with partner Lisa Smedley. After a month of wide ranging renovation the new workshop opened in early March 2013. The changes included new cement flooring, roller doors and the installation of extensive security systems. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Maureen &amp; Barry Wright of Burra last week began a long journey to update their popular River Murray Charts. They began at Yarrawonga last Monday and will have the company of Lisa Smedley and Ron &amp; Geraldine Smedley as road crew. The charts have been available since 1975 following an adventurous trip by the couple in a boat called Peregrine from Murray Bridge to Yarrawonga in 1973-74. More than 60,000 copies have since been sold, with regular updates as the charts have been reprinted. Now there has been a good flow down the river for the first time in many years, they have deemed it timely to undertake a major update.

<p>The Auhl Family History Room at the Burra Community Library has added Ian Auhl’s OAM to its collection. Auhl is Burra’s noted historian and last Tuesday his daughter Tania travelled from Kingston with a great addition to the Auhl Collection: the OAM and certificate received by her father on 14 June 1980. Accompanied by her cousin Avis Webster of Burra and friend Helen Nitschke, she presented the medal and framed certificate to the Community Library, where they were received by Library Assistant and family friend, Mary Woollacott. Ian Auhl (1914-1996) was a dedicated researcher who had a passion for Burra and its history. He was responsible for a long list of books on the town, notably among them The Story of the Monster Mine, Burra Sketchbook and Burra and District: a Pictorial Memoir.</p>
<p>Pigmy Bluetongues should benefit from improved grazing following a habitat protection project funded by the Federal Government’s Caring For Our Country Program. The lizard was once thought extinct until found in 1992 in grasslands in SA’s Mid North. Land owners who have Pigmy Bluetongues on their property are encouraged to attend a free grazing workshop being delivered by the Mid North Grasslands Working Group or to have a free grazing management plan developed for their property. They will be able to apply for funding to implement grazing management plans. The survival of the lizards depends on people managing grasslands sustainably. The bonus for landowners is that sustainable grazing can also improve the productivity of their properties.</p>

The Council’s Development Assessment Panel rejected the proposal last August, but Energy Australia (formerly TRUenergy) appealed against this decision in the Environment, Resources and Development Court.

Subsequently Council advised the court it did not wish to participate in or be represented at the hearing.</p>

<p>Stony Gap Wind Farm Appeal</p>
<p>An article further explains the Council’s legal position in withdrawing from the case to defend the Council’s Assessment Panel’s refusal to grant development plan consent to the Stony Gap Wind Farm proposal. Apparently Coffey and Dunn wish to continue the appeal hearing (scheduled for 16 May) and if they do so it will be totally at their cost. The Council’s costs thus far a said to total about $15,000. The Council has now negotiated an amended proposal with Truenergy that it believes is satisfactory to both parties. Both parties are now seeking ERD Court consent to the amended proposal by way of finalising the appeal. No turbine will be located within two kilometres of a dwelling.</p>

<p>Waterloo Wind Farm has a new ownership arrangement. Current operators EnergyAustralia have signed a joint partnership with Palisade Investment Partners and Northleaf Capital Partners. The latter two entities now own 75% of the facility. EnergyAustralia will continue to operate the plant. The company will also continue with its plans for the development of the 123MW Stony Gap wind farm project. They are anxious to continue building lasting relationships with the community. EnergyAustralia will continue to be a long term off-taker for both energy and large-scale generation certificates produced by the wind farm. As an energy retailer EnergyAustralia purchases these certificates in order to meet its obligations under the Renewable energy Target Scheme. The sale of a part share in the wind farm will see EnergyAustralia benefit from $228 million in profits. The Waterloo wind farm comprises 37 Vestas V90-3.0MW turbines.</p>

<p>Trixie Pearce Photographic Display</p>
<p>Felicity Martin, the daughter of Dr Thomas Dearlove and grand niece of Trixie Pearce has restored some of Trixie’s photographs from the period of around WWI and the 1920s. Trixie was a Burra Record journalist in the period and along with sister Nellie Pearce was a keen photographer. They were both strongly involved in the Ladies Mounted Band, the Cheer-up groups during the war and, through legacies, connected with both Leighton House and Pearce’s Buildings. The collection is on view at the Hallett Gallery any Sunday throughout the month of May from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. As well as Trixie’s photographs, the display includes some wonderful photographs sent by friends serving in Egypt and Palestine during WWI, ‘and part of the Charge of the Light Brigade, including Lieutenants Sandlands and Mc Bride’.</p>
<p>[This short article needs a little untangling.</p>
<p>Trixie Pearce was more formally Beatrice Eleanor Pearce 1885-1927, known generally as Trix.</p>
<p>Her sister Nell was Victoria Nellie Pearce, who married Archibald Dearlove.</p>
<p>It was her sister Miss Gertrude Pearce (1875-1949) who worked for the Burra Record; being a journalist on the staff for 261⁄2 years until she retired in January 1944.</p>
<p>There was no Ladies Mounted Band. The young women of the Cheer-up Society in Burra formed the Burra Cheer-up Ladies’ Band, which appeared first in February 1917. It was seen as necessary as the town band had been so depleted by enlistments for war service. It was never mounted. The confusion originated when a group of 42 young women, mounted on horses, formed a guard of honour for the Governor when he visited Burra in October 1915. The Governor was so impressed that he asked them to go to Adelaide the following month to repeat their performance when he opened the Cheer-up Hut.</p>
<p>Above: a photograph of a couple of dozen of the Cheer-up Ladies on their mounts on the banks of the Burra Creek with Kingston Street Bridge in the background.</p>
<p>The reference to the Charge of the Light Brigade is a little misplaced. That occurred on 25 October 1854 during the Battle of Balaclava in the Crimean War.</p>
<p>The reference should be to the famous charge by the Australian Light Horse in the battle to take Beersheba on 31 October 1917. It was in this attack that Lieut. Reg. Sandland (not Sandlands) lost his life. Lieut. Norman McBride of the 3rd Light Horse was also killed in action in Palestine on 22 December 1917.]</p>

<p>Burra Hospital is to hold a trivia night at the Burra Sporting Complex on 14 June. Proceeds will be split between the Hospital and the Heart Foundation. Further funds for the Foundation will come from a 500 km desert walk. Burra nurse Donna Kelly and her friend Gill Plastow will cover the distance between Ceduna and Woomera beginning on 21 July and taking about two weeks to complete the course. This is not the pair’s first desert walk. They have previously covered the Googs Track, the French Line and the Madigan Line while raising funds and awareness for the cause of healthier hearts.</p>

<p>Nathaniel O’Brien of BCS has been selected as one of 28 South Australians to perform in the 2013 Class of Cabaret at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival. The program commenced in March and was designed for Years 10,11 &amp; 12 students and teachers and those interested in a career in cabaret and theatre. There have been several workshops and the ABC is making a documentary to air next month to coincide with the final performance. The ABC came to Burra last week to film at the school before continuing on to Nathaniel’s home for more scenes and recording of some of Nathaniel’s own songs backed with harmonies from his Dad and sister. Nathaniel will also participate in a master class with Adelaide Festival Director, Kate Ceberano in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>While the program includes interviews with seven students, it focuses chiefly on two; a student from Norwood- Morialta and Nathaniel, who is the only student in the group from a rural school. [Photo]</p>

<p>The Cornish Association of Victoria will commence the Overland Gold “Cornish Convoy” on Monday, tracing the overland routes from SA to the Victorian goldfields in the 1850s. They are particularly interested in tracing routes taken by Burra miners who departed for the goldfields in great numbers. The overland journey took six to eight weeks and covered a distance of some 720 km. The group of about 20 people in 12 vehicles will arrive in Burra about midday for a quick lunch before meeting with the Burra History Group at the Town Hall and will then depart via the old Adelaide Road to Sod Hut, Black Springs and Marrabel and on to Kapunda for the evening.</p>

<p>Family Fun Day at Redbanks attracted about 120 people on Sunday. The event aimed to increase the natural and cultural history awareness of locals. [Photo]</p>
<p>The event was hosted by Natural Resources Northern &amp; Yorke. The event included Aboriginal cultural tours, fossil displays and a palaeontologist representation. Redbanks differs from many other megafauna sites as the fossils are often found as whole specimens and it contains the naturally visible geological profiles up to 30 metres deep, exposed through the incision of watercourses.

<p>Roy Taplin has been recognised as a heritage hero after being nominated by the Premier Mr Jay Weatherill to receive an SA Heritage Heroes Award 2013. The premier met Mr Taplin during a visit to the Burra Railway Station this year. Mr Taplin, a retired master painter and decorator has carried out meticulous restoration at the Burra Town Hall and following the receipt of a Government Grant in 2010 began work on the Burra Railway Station. Here there was extensive termite damage and the interior had been invaded by pigeons. A local builder and plumber were appointed to assist, but Mr Taplin co-ordinated the project and also carried out many major repairs and undertook the painting. His efforts included replacing floor stumps, repairs to fretting walls, replacement of rotting and termite damaged architraves and skirting, manufacturing kitchen cupboards and mantelpieces as well as the painting. The station will ultimately house an interpretive centre focussed on Burra’s natural history prior to European settlement. Roy is very reluctant to seek any publicity or acknowledgement of his work and so was not informed of his nomination, said friend and President of the Burra History group Ms Meredith Satchell. She said previous experience had suggested he would probably have declined the award had he learned of it. As a consequence Ms Satchell accepted the awards for Roy at the Bob Hawkes Building at the University of South Australia last Tuesday night and handed it to him at the railway station later.

<p>Cornish Convoy. A group of cars following the overland route from SA to the Victorian Goldfields in the 1850s passed through Burra last week. While in Burra they spent time at the Burra Town Hall where they heard a brief talk on Burra’s early history from Eric Fuss and followed this up with a driving tour of historic sites led by Julian Ratcliffe. After Burra they headed to Sod Hut, which would have been the first day’s stop on the 1852 ‘copper road’. They then went on to Black Springs, Kapunda, Wellington, Meningie, Naracoorte, Horsham, Glenorchy, Talbot and finally to Castlemaine where the Mount Alexander gold rush was the initial impetus for the overland travellers in 1852. Project leader Moira Drew is a descendent of Thomas and Maria Ninnes who left Burra for the goldfields 3 February 1852. They travelled as part of a family group with several bullock drays. Charles Rule left Burra the same day with a group of men.</p>

<p>Burra Auxiliary of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital Auxiliaries Association has decided to dissolve after 57 years of service due to declining numbers. The group was formed in 1956. Over the years funds have been raised through raffles, catering, sale of merchandise, fashion parades and trading tables etc. President Leonie Ryan said declining numbers meant the Auxiliary could no longer function effectively. Remaining members met recently for a farewell lunch. [Photo of Jenny Wall, Pat Taylor, Maureen Bevan, Leonie Ryan, Mavis Spackman and Colleen Spackman.]</p>

<p>World War I Soldiers Project</p>
<p>With the centenary of the outbreak of World War I approaching in 2014 and the centenary of the landing at Gallipoli in the following year, The Burra History Group is preparing a descriptive list of the servicemen and servicewomen who appear on the large roll of Honour in the Burra RSL Room/Council Chamber.</p>
<p>The intention is to provide family researchers and other interested parties with a brief summary of family details so that the bare surname and initials on the roll can be properly identified. To do this we have tried to find the full name, date and place of birth and the name of the parents, for each person on the Honour Roll. We have then outlined the bare details of their war service and, where possible this has been supplemented with a photograph.</p>
<p>A significant number of the servicemen wrote letters home that were published in the Burra Record. We aim to include these because they bring to life the personalities of these young men from a century ago. The first groups of young volunteers from Burra went to Egypt and from there to the appalling conditions of Gallipoli. Many were then transferred to France and endured the unimaginable horrors of the Western Front in France and Belgium. Some became prisoners of war. Others remained in the Middle East and saw action in Palestine as the allied forces fought their way north to Syria. A few served in the Royal Australian Navy and one or two transferred to the Australian Flying Corps in the later stages of the conflict. Another small group joined up in England and served with the British Army. A small number of nurses saw service in the UK, France, the Middle East, India, and on hospital ships.</p>
<p>The letters reveal fascinating details of their experiences, some of which are remarkably frank about the conditions, considering that they passed through censorship. There are accounts of experiences at the front, but even more about personal thoughts and experiences on leave. Some soldiers in England managed to see quite a lot of the tourist sites and those struggling up though Palestine recount how the Bible was coming to life before their eyes, as they visited Bethlehem, Jerusalem or Jericho.</p>
<p>Since there are 490 names on the Honour Roll, gathering this information has been a large task spread over several years. In the end it is intended to make the results available in digital format and we are investigating ways of making the material accessible at a couple of sites in the town and on a CD. At this stage we have completed the collection of the basic material for most of those on the roll, but we need some help to complete the undertaking.</p>
<p>We would certainly appreciate any photographs of the personnel on the list. Any photographs would be scanned and the originals returned promptly. A more frustrating problem has been our inability to identify all the people on the roll. In a few cases we think we know who the person is, but have been unable to find the service records. More commonly we have simply been unable to put a name to the initials. Sometimes there are several persons with the same initials and the records carry no information that would enable us to make a choice. In a few instances we think the person concerned enlisted overseas and the records are not readily available. If you can help with any aspect of this project it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>We have been unable to identify the following people in service records:</p>
<p>Brown, H. (Herbert Henry?) Clarke, W. (Mt Bryan East?) Colbert, T.J.</p>
<p>Collins, C. Collins, H. (Leighton area?) Doherty, P.</p>
<p>Dolan, J. Falkner, J. (Nurse) (Faulkner?) Fricker, W.</p>
<p>Hartley, W.H. Hayes, R. (Not Robert. Ross?) Hogan, N.J. (Leighton area?)</p>
<p>James, J. (World’s End area?) Johnson, F.G. King, H.R. (Black Springs area?)</p>
<p>Lacey, F. Lee, H.J. Lee, J.J.</p>
<p>Lilley, A. Lowe, B. (Not B.C.Lowe) Mason, E.</p>
<p>McMahon, J.F. (or F.J.?) O’Grady, S. Pavy, A.</p>
<p>Pohlner, W. Salter, W. Smiley, P.V.</p>
<p>Solly, A.S. (Nurse) Sutton, B.J. Wade, M.</p>
<p>Whitty, W. Williams, S. Wilson, L.K.</p>

<p>In addition the following personnel seem not to have served in the Australian Forces and any information about them would be appreciated as well:</p>
<p>Robert James Burns (UK forces)</p>
<p>Gilbert Lewis (Indian Army)</p>
<p>Murray, C. (UK forces?)</p>

<p>A Burra Menswatch Committee has been established after a group of men in the district became concerned about the number of men taking their own lives in the area. It is headed by Bill Stockman and has raised funds for three suicide prevention programs through its Ski for Life event earlier in the year. The first will be sponsored by Les Warnes and Princess Royal and will involve three nights’ training. The program develops skills to help people watch for and identify other men who are struggling. It aims to help them in their times of need, to provide skills to know how to refer someone for professional help and what to do if someone you know says they are thinking about taking their own life.</p>
