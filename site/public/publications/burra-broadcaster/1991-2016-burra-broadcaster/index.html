                <p>Note. The Burra Broadcaster has been summarised from hard copy held in the Burra Community Library. While complete runs are preserved from the later years, there are some unfortunate gaps in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The Burra Broadcaster began, according to its masthead, as ‘The advertising medium for Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Farrell Flat and Districts’. Initially it carried little news; indeed many issues carried no news at all and comprised only advertising. Some issues were as small as a double-sided A4 sheet, while others expanded to four or even 8 sides of material. News items were rare in 1991 and when present, they were often closely allied to something in the advertising copy.</p>
<p>Although appearing to have been issued weekly, there are some irregularities. Its initial inclusion as an insert in the School Newsletter explains why there are gaps when school holidays occurred.</p>
<p>The 100th number on 24 February 1993 outlines the history of the publication up till then. Burra Community Print began producing advertising copy. When the 100th number was issued the editor said they had produced 415 editions. None earlier than ‘Number 2’ have been preserved in the local library. The editor also says that editorial comment extended for 112 editions, but in fact there is almost no editorial content until after Issue 57 and even then it seems more editorial policy in the selection of items than editorials as such. Burra Community Print moved to new premises in December 1990 and apparently this and the purchase of new computerised equipment led to the production of Issue 1. It began as an insert in the School Newsletter.</p>
<p>The policy of the editor was to include articles from all sorts of contributors and inevitably this led to complaints about some of the views being expressed. [See the editorial for Issue 94.] One result was that the paper was forced to become a separate entity rather than an insert. [When this occurred is not stated, but clearly before Issue 100.] Eventually the printing of the School &amp; Community News was lost to a Clare company. [Again, when this happened is not stated.] This was a serious loss to the enterprise, but the paper in fact doubled its circulation and the content became more profitable. By 1993 the editor reports they were in the process of building infrastructure to support a substantially bigger and better paper and the following years produced the evidence that this ambition was realised.</p>
<p>Note Concerning the later version of Burra Broadcaster 2013-2016</p>
<p>When The Mid North Broadcaster ceased publication in 2013 Michelle Osborn began an online version of Burra Broadcaster from July-August of that year. In December 2013 the first hard copy of that newspaper appeared. It soon settled down to a fortnightly publication, though there were exceptions to that. It was initially all in black and white, but after gaining some AGL sponsorship the front and back pages appeared in colour from Issue 51, 30 March 2016. It ceased publication with Issue 66, 26 October 2016.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC Elections will be held on Saturday 4 May with polling booths at Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan Institute, Booborowie Institute from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Burra Civic Centre.</p>
<p>There is concern at the small number of voters who turn out in the Burra township compared with the outlying areas. Some outside areas record a 90% turnout, while Burra last time had only 20%. As a result five of seven elected members are from outlying districts, which means 70% of the district’s population produces just 30% of Council representation. You should vote; a more evenly balanced Council is in the best interests of all.</p>

<p>I feel the articles published in the paper regarding Council Elections were not in the best interests of community unity. There are no wards and therefore no ‘town’ Councillors. The Council in the past year has represented both town and district in an unbiased manner and I trust the Council elected on 4 May will do the same.</p>

Examples of Stephen’s work can be seen in some of Burra’s Hotels, the new Barker’s Homes Cottages, numerous bed and breakfast establishments in the area and in the newly refurbished Tourist Office in Market Square, but most of their work comes by word of mouth from private clients.</p>

<p>Adam’s Menswear &amp; Coppermine Ladies’ &amp; Children’s Wear have combined under one roof and the new look Adam’s has moved two doors down Commercial Street. The new store is located in the old Drew &amp; Crewes’ Building and is somewhat reminiscent of the old Bence’s shop with a spacious display area. The new premises become a one-stop shop for all the family’s clothing needs. The owner, George Pannell has done most of the building work himself. Most of the fittings and shelving are from the original Bence’s store.</p>

<p>The City of Woodville Choral Group was established in 1981 and fostered by the City of Woodville Council in its aim to encourage arts in the community. It began with twenty-nine members, but has grown to more than seventy, drawn from across the metropolitan area and the Adelaide Hills. It presents music for church services, church and school concerts, civil and church weddings, retirement villages, nursing homes and charity events. They sing for special City of Woodville functions and present Christmas carols at Westfield Arndale and at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The musical director is Rosemary Narin, who took over from the first conductor, Peter Ruys, in 1982. She has wide experience with the Country Choral Association at Lameroo and Pinnaroo, the Gawler Barossa Oratorio Choir and the Uniting Church Choirs of Broadview and Prospect. She is a teacher of piano and singing and directs Primary School Choirs and has sung in the Adelaide Girls’ Choir. The accompanist Betty Tothill has been with the choir since 1983. Rosemary has also been organist at St Mary’s Church in Burra.</p>
<p>[There is no obvious reason for the appearance of this item at this time. Rosemary Nairn (not Narin) was born Rosemary Reed of Burra.]</p>

<p>Burra Motel</p>
<p>Five new rooms are approaching completion in time for the gourmet weekend on 16 &amp; 17 May. This brings to twenty the number of rooms and caters for large bus groups. Manager John Stuart expects to benefit from being able to accommodate touring groups. The new development includes a restaurant to be opened in June – probably to be called ‘Jumbucks’. The licensed restaurant will offer an à la carte menu and will welcome diners who are not guests at the hotel.</p>
<p>The Occupational Health &amp; Safety Commission is reviewing child safety codes in response to the high rate of on farm injuries and deaths to minors. The new code would prevent children (under 16) from being in the vicinity of farm machinery. Although a code of practice does not have the force of legislation and differs in its flexibility, it could form the basis for prosecutions. The code would impose a hazard assessment process, removal of hazards and instruction for the child. It says children should not be in areas likely to pose a risk, such as silos, dams, the vicinity of animals and power driven or other machinery. The UFS says that while it is concerned about the injury rate for rural children, they do not support the code, which places penalties on farmers and their families and is essentially unworkable. What is required is better education and increased awareness of the dangers.</p>

Mr Robert Heading, Wildildie’s manager and owner, says he couldn’t have done it without the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. He had purchased the property two years ago to establish a business growing broombush for brush fences, but that venture failed and he turned to renovating the old homestead with the aid of NEIS funding as income support. The home has three guest rooms; two doubles and one twin and the basic room rate is $70 per double per night.</p>

He says we are often travelling on typical 1950s roads trying to meet the demands of the 1990s traffic.</p>

<p>The Burra Cycling Classic</p>
<p>The first official Burra-Adelaide Cycling road race was run on 21 September 1907. The machines were then rather heavy single geared cycles. The roads were mostly unsealed. Despite the difficulties the winner was credited with the time of 6 hours 11 minutes 13 seconds. The race became an Annual Promotion and was eventually raced for Burra to Adelaide and Adelaide to Burra in alternate years. The route varied considerable and the distance covered fluctuated between about 100 and 120 miles. Many of the nation’s best cyclists have competed, especially in the 1920s and 1930s. Names like Hubert Opperman, Bill Moritz, Deane Toseland, Keith Thurgood and Ron Whitehorn appear among the contestants. Many Burra riders have competed. Ian Auhl has a photograph of eleven locals in a race from the 1930s: Don Kerin, Clem Wilson, Leo Taylor, Tom Allen, Eric Scroop, Theo Pohlner, Bob Morton, Charlie Griffiths, Rex Opperman, Tom Garrard and Keith Lower. The race was not run during WWII, but returned in 1948. Traffic conditions and traffic signals in the metropolitan area saw the end of the race move out of the city centre. Several destinations were tried and in 1985 a race was conducted on an out and back course, finishing at Burra and this proved to be a successful format. The 1992 fixture is scheduled for 12 September over 125 km from Burra to Riverton and return. The race will start at noon in front of the Burra Hotel and end at about 4 p.m. by the Commercial Hotel. On 13 September a Graded Criterium [sic] event will be raced on a Burra Street Circuit.</p>

<p>Last Steam Train to Burra</p>
<p>There was great excitement in Burra when the railway from Adelaide was opened in 1870. The railway then pressed on north to become an important link in the SA network, linking Adelaide with Broken Hill, Perth and Central Australia. Now 20th century transport has hastened the decline of the line and it will be closed to passenger traffic at the end of September and freight trains seem likely to cease soon as well. The Australian Railway Historical Society and SteamRanger are marking this historic event with a special last run featuring two locomotives representative of the line. The locomotives will be either Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey or more likely The Duke of Edinburgh and Alco Diesel 958. The train will depart Adelaide at 8 a.m. and return about 8.30 p.m. Loco 621 The Duke of Edinburgh will lead the train from Adelaide. It was typical of passenger trains on the line in the 1940s and 1950s. If a larger train is required then extra centenary cars will be added and loco 520 Sir Malcolm Barclay-Harvey will have to head the heavier load. Arrival at Burra is expected at 1 p.m. and there will be a break there of about 11⁄2 hours. There are no turning facilities at Burra for large locomotives and so the steam locomotive will have to return tender first with the Diesel 958 doing all the work. There will be slow journey back, starting from Burra at about 2.30 p.m. There will be generous photo stops en route.</p>

<p>R.J. Phillips writes to the editor concerning the greening of Burra.</p>
<p>Efforts to green Burra raise some concerns. These activities are undertaken with little or no research into what species are indigenous to Burra. Early descriptions of the area prior to settlement indicate that the dominant species was Lamandra dura (crin grass) and that the Burra-Terowie district was a natural grassland, with trees, red gum, blue gum and casuarinas restricted to creeks and small pockets in the hills. As for beautifying the creek, that is all well and good, but these well-intentioned people should understand that they are destroying Burra’s heritage in so far that dugouts stretched along the creek banks for eight miles south towards Princess Royal. Apart from the Mitchell Flat area, evidence of these dwellings is hard to find due to human interference. I believe that in a heritage town ‘tree planting on a mass scale should only occur after considered planning and consultation with the appropriate heritage bodies.</p>

<p>Johnny Greenhorn writes to the editor in reply to R.J. Phillips’ letter of 2 September:</p>
<p>[Basically he says he is just glad to see someone doing something about planting trees and not just talking about it. If concern about native species is so great then try doing something about it. He does, however, fail to address the heritage points made by R.J. Phillips.]</p>

<p>The BBH Football Club Season in Review</p>
<p>BBH finished the [‘A’ Grade] season with the wooden spoon. They won only one game out of 17 in the year. While there were many factors in this unsatisfying result, a principal problem was the lack of big men around the ground, especially in key attacking and defending positions. A disturbing aspect of the NEFL is the dominance of just two sides, North Clare and BSR. The remaining four sides struggle to keep in touch with those two.</p>
<p>The ‘B’ Grade side scored three wins and 14 losses.</p>
<p>Senior Colts ended the minor rounds second place and hopefully will play in the final.</p>
<p>The Junior Colts end the season in third place, but were eliminated by North Clare in the 1st semi-final in a game played in atrocious conditions.</p>

<p>Burra Cycling Handicap</p>
<p>Last weekend almost 300 cyclists and associates met in Burra for this year’s handicap. 1990 winner, Brenton McDonald was victorious with Mike Elleway and Mark Piro in the second and third places. President of SA Wheelman’s Association Mr Des Keegan was happy with the weekend’s events. He said the SA Wheelman’s Association was keen to stage a Burra to Adelaide race to coincide with Burra’s sesquicentennial celebrations in 1995.</p>

<p>G. Barnard writes re the planting of trees in Burra:</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that English medico Dr Robert Brummitt (1851-1927) came to SA in 1875 and was in practice here from 1877 to 1901. He was a well-known Botanist and obtained significant collections of plants from Clare, Burra, World’s End creek, Black Springs and Apoinga while he was here. Also well-known writer Hans Minchin describes Burra as having ‘open downs with grassy hills’.</p>
<p>The hills and ranges once timbered and beautiful have been attacked and ignored, in the pursuit of industrial, pastoral and agricultural wealth. The only trees to be seen are those that have been planted around homesteads. Early settlers planted trees and landowners are again becoming more tree-minded, to provide shelter to the stock – much needed in this open country. Sheoaks and blue gums were culled to provide timber for the mines and what was left was eventually used for firewood. Original grasses were Silver Grass and Danthonia, Water grass, Bunch and Spear Grasses and wild oats in the hills. Where the Silver grass grew on the flats, lucerne is now grown. [The writer then goes on to list many grasses growing in the district and also many of the trees and then the birds that rely upon them.]</p>
<p>Without the continual re-greening program we would see, as we have seen in the past, a great decline in our local bird life. So now is your opportunity to plant some of the trees native to this area, e.g., wattles, native hop trees, peppermint gums, sandalwood, Sheoak, tea-tree, quondong and mallee.</p>
<p>‘So – Mr Phillips does it really matter what sort of tree we plant, provided we continue to plant?’</p>

<p>Railway Lines Disappear.</p>
<p>A contractor has been engaged to remove the railway line between Hallett and Burra. It is reported that Australia National wanted to use the 75 kg rail elsewhere. It is said to be in excellent condition. The contractor gets to keep [and dispose of] the sleepers. Mr Russell King, speaking for Australia National, said the removal would cease at Burra.</p>
<p>Page 2</p>
<p>R.J. Phillips writes in response to G. Barnard. He thank the latter for raising the level of the debate and goes on to say that some of the trees being planted are inappropriate. Eucalyptus spathulata for example tends to split and fall over, while Eucalyptus sideroxylon rosea, which has been planted along the bank behind the Council Chamber has not only obscured the archaeological value of the area, but will threaten the building when they reach their full height of over 100 ft.</p>
<p>[He goes on to list a number of other unsuitable imports from elsewhere in Australia and to suggest that species truly native to the area are being overlooked.]</p>
<p>He ends:</p>
<p>‘So – G. Barnard, I believe it does matter what sort of trees we plant, and how and where we plant them. You may find ‘The vegetation of SA’ by R.L. Specht and ‘Native Trees of SA’ by C.D. Boomsma interesting reading.’</p>

<p>Alicia Elliot writes to express her disappointment at the paper’s endorsement, promotion and support for ‘The naked Revue Show’. She found the advertising degrading.</p>
<p>Fr David Lamont, ‘The Rectory’ Burra, writes also condemning ‘The Naked Revue’. He is careful to articulate that he is not opposed to alcohol as such and finds nothing wrong with the human body either, but a naked revue is inappropriate in our community. He is also disapproving of the combination of alcohol and the revue and fears that the revue is nothing but pornographic and erotic and sends a bad message to the youth of the district.</p>

These events comprise the Heart Foundation’s major community fundraising effort for the year. The Burra event will start at the Kindergarten Car Park and go along Bridge Terrace, Paxton Terrace, Smelts Road, Landore Street, Ludgvan Street, St Just Street and the cycle path to the starting point; a distance of 3.2 km.</p>
<p>Stan Batten, Australian Independent Alliance Candidate writes to carefully avoid stating a position on the ‘Naked Review Show’.</p>
<p>He says he is pleased to see that people are concerned about ‘community values’. He considers it was not the community, but Parliament reduced the age of majority from 21 to 18 in 1971, extended liquor trading hours in 1967, extended hotel trading to midnight on Friday and Saturday and approved nude bathing at Maslins Beach. He goes on to list a number of places where we could see representations of the nude body; at the art gallery, as statues in parks, at a beach and he says it is merely a question of where we draw the line.</p>
<p>‘We are part of the community that have elected governments that have changed “community” standards.’</p>
<p>George Woods writes in response to the previous letters opposing the ‘Naked Revue’. He thinks they were ‘over the top’. He seeks to draw a distinction between pornography and erotic entertainment.</p>
<p>‘I personally have attended such shows where the audience was 400 male construction workers drinking alcohol and not misbehaving once. To have uttered obscenities met instant retribution by other audience members &amp; to have physically touched on of the “working girls” would have given you a one way ticket to outpatients. One only generally heard comments relating to the performers skill, beauty, or athletic ability.’</p>
<p>‘This is 1992, and not 1952 after all.’</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC has received the go-ahead for a number of projects following approval under the Local Capital Works Program announced last week by its Chairman and the Federal Minister for Local Government, David Simmons. The projects will cost $88,000 of which $63,667 will come from the Commonwealth program and will be concluded in six months. The projects include upgrading of the Burra Town Hall, re-roofing the Booborowie Hall, public amenities at Mt Bryan and improved drainage for Farrell Flat. Council chairman Graham Kellock said the projects had been on the agenda for many months, but needed financial assistance. They will provide some local employment as well as injecting money into the economy.</p>

<p>Peter Reith, Shadow Treasurer and Deputy Opposition Leader, spoke at a well-attended meeting at the Burra Sporting Complex on 17 October. Over 160 people gathered to hear him explain the Coalition’s Fightback package, including the Goods and Services Tax. He compared the proposal with the present Wholesale Sales Tax at varying rates on a wide range of goods. The uniform GST would simplify this by removing seven taxes, including the Wholesale Sales Tax, payroll tax and fuel excise. Personal income tax would fall and there would be increases in the family allowance, social security benefits and pensions. The average increase in sales tax due to the GST would be about 4% because of the removal of the existing wholesale taxes etc.</p>

<p>Draft Tourism Strategy</p>
<p>The Burra, Clare, Auburn-Saddleworth and Riverton Councils have undertaken to develop a tourism strategy and the draft plan has now been completed by PPK Planning and Hannaford, Benson, Ainslie Pty Ltd. It is recommended the term ‘Lower Mid North’ be replaced by Clare-Burra to describe the area more effectively. The study identifies three main sub regions: Clare Valley, Burra and Gilbert Valley. Clare-Burra was chosen because of its recognised national identity. The strategy aims to increase tourism and promoted sustainable development. Opportunities for development include antique trails, educational trips, historic homestead tours, a copper trail from Burra to Port Wakefield or Kapunda, wine and food appreciation events, cemetery tours, heritage and a genealogy centre at Burra. There is also a suggestion of uniting the various tourist organisations in to one Regional Economic Development Board, employing a tourism officer to implement the strategy plan and create opportunities that it implies.</p>

<p>Flood Damage is estimated to be in excess of $100,000 in the Burra Burra DC area and the council has applied for aid from the Local Government Disaster Fund.

Council will continue to repair minor road damage, but wet weather continues to hamper efforts to clear culverts, and major repairs will have to be postponed till drier conditions prevail.</p>

<p>SA Occupational Health and Safety Commission has released a public discussion paper on child safety on farms. The Member for Custance, Ian Venning urges farmers to look at the paper seriously and to respond. Although farms are undoubtedly dangerous work places, the Government must not automatically resort to regulation to solve a problem at the expense of discouraging children from becoming involved in farming at all. Self-regulation has to be the best way of solving child safety problems. The SAFU became involved when the Minister, Bob Gregory, realised there were ways other than regulation that could be employed in solving the problem. Copies of the paper are available free of charge and public comment is sought until 31 May 1993.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>As we start the third year of publication we are setting targets for expansion to become a part of life in Burra. Conversations with other printers and newspaper publishers reveal that generally they found 1992 a tough year in a highly competitive field. Despite the difficulties most also reported that in these difficult times they had found people resorting more to small regional advertising as the most efficient way to increase sales.</p>
<p>The Broadcaster itself has grown and increasingly trades and services from outside the town have appeared in its pages. In 1992 our sister paper the Jamestown Journal appeared. This has grown with the support of the local community and has become a profitable medium for both advertising and news. This in turn has resulted in other larger papers giving Jamestown a stronger focus in their reports. We hope to do the same for Burra in 1993.</p>
<p>One of the chief complaints about the Broadcaster is that it focuses on politics and sport and is too much of a ‘greenie, feminist’ paper. This may be so, but we publish what people choose to submit. We employ up to nine people, but have yet to take on a journalist, so we rely absolutely on public information.</p>
<p>We appeal to all bodies in the Burra community, business, private and sporting to take advantage of the Broadcaster.</p>

<p>The Variety Club of Australia will run this year’s SA Variety Club Bash in August. It will start in Adelaide on 14 August and end in Clare on Sunday 21 August. Burra will be represented by its own ‘Bash Boys’ in car 144: Richard Dollman, Craig Wissell, Andrew Nourse and ex-Burra boy Mick ‘Wally’ H—atz [illegible].</p>
<p>The event raises money for childhood cancer research and children’s charities, with 93 cents in the dollar going directly to assisting children in SA. The boys will use a 1960 XK Falcon – repaired by Andrew and Neil at Burra Auto Repairs. All cars must be pre-1966. They require an entry fee of $5,000 and assistance in building the car.</p>
<p>The Variety Club aids Burra as well. Last week they came to the assistance of Burra Community School Boarding House with a donation of $3,262 for a fridge, freezer, stove, etc.</p>

<p>Floods. Torrential rain last weekend saw the Burra Creek break its banks in the worst flood in living memory. Roads were cut and the town isolated. Burra North was worst hit. Several homes were threatened by floodwaters. Sandbagging was needed at the Royal Exchange Hotel, Sara’s and the Aberdeen Roadhouse. The tributary that crosses Commercial Street broke its banks about noon and the recreation area along Burra Creek all but disappeared under water. A number of visitors were stranded in the town overnight. The waters had gone down by the following morning.</p>

<p>Farrell Flat Silo was forced to close last Wednesday on 20 January. At the start of the season much of the wheat coming in was downgraded to GP or seed grade. General Manager of SACBH said the state could expect to have about 3⁄4 of the harvest downgraded to GP or seed category. Up to last week 1 million tonnes had been delivered in SA and 54% had been segregated as feed and another 27% was GP1 or GP2. At Farrell Flat the silo manager, Jimmy Winters, last week said he had taken in over 9,000 tonnes of wheat and only 10% had been downgraded. Because of this exceptional harvest in the region one 7,000 tonne cell of downgraded wheat had to be emptied in order to take more ASW. 14 local men helped to purge the cell in one day; putting in 93 man-hours. The weekend rain put an end to the good fortune and any wheat not harvested by now would pretty well be ruined.</p>

<p>The Burra Broadcaster</p>
<p>This issue is the 100th since changing to the present format. All in all the advertising medium put out by the Burra Community Print has seen 415 editions and editorial comment has been running for 112 editions. The Broadcaster began when BCP moved to new premises in December 1990. New computerised equipment and training of new staff enabled the Broadcaster to be developed as an insert in the local school newsletter.</p>
<p>As the Broadcaster grew it became necessary to expand our format and we began to include substantially more editorial content. Although the Broadcaster has not employed professional journalists, the input from local the community was steady. Conflict over editorial content led to the Broadcaster becoming a separate entity and eventually BCP lost the printing of the School Community News to a Clare company.</p>
<p>Although this was a serious loss, it pushed the Broadcaster along at a quicker rate and resulted in a doubling of circulation and more profitable content. We are currently building the infrastructure to support a bigger and better paper.</p>

<p>John Oates, Secretary-Treasurer of the Burra Picnic Race Club, writes to express their disappointment at the number of people who brought their own alcohol and soft drinks to the races. The Club is not out to rip people off and all the funds raised go to the RFDS and SES, who really deserve all the donations they can get.</p>

<p>The 2nd Annual Antique &amp; Decorators’ Fair drew an estimated 2,000 people to Burra last weekend. The event was well received by both townsfolk and visitors. Both the quality and quantity of goods on display was impressive. Market Day on the banks of the creek brought colour and life to the weekend. Buskers, stalls and clowns gave a carnival atmosphere to Market Square. Dave Cotton’s Puppet Theatre entranced the youngsters. Stallholders reported a good level of interest.

<p>Free Rock Music Workshops will be offered at Burra in the last weekend in May. They will feature Adelaide Band ‘Billy and the Redfins’ and two Mid North-based musicians, Frank Zaknich of Clare (drummer) and Elizabeth Robertson of Leighton (vocalist). This is an initiative of the Burra Arts Council, funded by the Northern Country Arts Board and Centre State Youth Strategy. As well as instrumental sessions there will be a financial management workshop with entertainment industry accountant Mark Kraus (the Redfins’ saxophonist) and also sessions on original composition and arrangement.</p>
<p>There will be a rock concert-cum cabaret in Burra Town Hall on Saturday 29 May. The target group for the workshops is aged 15-18, but older persons may also participate.</p>

<p>Burra’s Big Weekend of Rock Music was a huge success. Over 40 participants took part in the instrumental workshops and on Saturday night the town rocked till late as local band Stone Crows and Billy and the Redfins performed to an appreciative audience. On Sunday the participants fronted up for a talk on financial management and after lunch they put on a concert involving 11 guitarists, 4 drummers, 3 key-board players, a harpist and 2 saxophonists. The feedback on the event has been very positive. The proceeds from the bar will aid the Variety Club.</p>

<p>Georgia Hyde Secretary of the Burra Arts Council writes:</p>
<p>The old Post &amp; Telegraph Office presently being used as the postmaster’s residence is soon to be sold by Australia Post. At first glance this building may seem to be an ugly collection of additions and unsympathetic paintwork. Beneath that there lies evidence of a once grand building with many a story to tell of the bustling days of Burra. Although it is a heritage listed building the current and future owners have no obligation to restore it to its former glory. We of the Burra Arts Council feel the building should be donated to the town for use as an Art Gallery and/or a Post &amp; Telegraph Museum. Restored, it would be a great asset to the town. We have written to many organisations including J150, Heritage, National Trust and the SA Art Gallery, hoping to enlist support for getting Australia Post to donate the building in time for Burra’s 150th anniversary in 1995. We hope the people and Council of Burra will support us too by writing letters to Australia Post and the above organisations to save the building for public use.</p>
<p>Helen Stockman, past Chairman of the 1st Parent Scout Group writes to say that the other night the 1st Burra Scout Group and its Parent Group were disbanded after a long period of activity in the town. Although it is sad to see this, we can look back over the history of the group with pride. Not many other towns in the Mid North can boast such a line-up of Queen’s Scouts and such fine people. Many thanks to all who served the Scout Group over the years.</p>
<p>Notice. A Public Meeting is called at 10 Morehead Street on Wednesday 9 June at 7.30 p.m. to discuss the future directions of the Burra District.</p>

<p>Daisy Kennedy Commemorative Concert</p>
<p>On Sunday 27 June the Carl Linger Ensemble will perform a concert commemorating one of Burra’s most famous daughters: Daisy Kennedy.</p>
<p>She was born at the Commercial Hotel in 1893 and later lived in Kangaroo Street while her father was Headmaster of Burra School [Joseph A. Kennedy 1893-95]. Daisy was a keen student and was permitted to begin classes at the age of four, when she also began playing the piano. At seven she began violin lessons on a half-sized instrument. At ten she was a gold medallist at the Adelaide University and this was followed by a three-year scholarship at Elder Conservatorium when she was thirteen. In 1908 the renowned violinist Kubelik toured Australia and after much effort Daisy obtained an audience with him. Kubelik was impressed and urged her, instead of studying, to go to Prague with a letter of introduction from him to the famous teacher Sevcik. She did this and soon went to the Vienna Conservatorium, where Sevcik was to take up a position. After two years she gained her diploma and with Sevcik went to London to play at the Queen’s Hall. She moved to London to live in 1913 and played there under many famous conductors. She made several trips to Australia with her first husband, pianist Benno Moiseiwitsch (Moiseivich) [1890-1963]. Later she visited with her second husband the poet John Drinkwater. She also made tours of Europe, England and America. Later she retired somewhat from public life, but played a great deal of chamber music and in 1938 after the death of her husband she took a position as leader and conductor of a male orchestra.* She was tall, slender and attractive when young, was unspoiled by her success and ever gracious with a keen sense of humour.</p>
<p>The Carl Linger Ensemble was formed in 1985 and has a reputation for its varied repertoire, especially in the area of early Australian compositions. It takes its name from Carl Linger (Berlin 1810-Adelaide 1862) who made a considerable contribution to early musical life in SA.</p>
<p>The concert will include a new work by Paul Paviour ‘A Distant Music’ composed to commemorate the centenary of Daisy Kennedy’s birth.</p>
<p>[*She married Benno Moiseiwitsch in April 1914 and they were divorced in 1924. In December 1924 she married John Drinkwater, who died in 1937, leaving her in need of an income.]</p>

<p>AdChem’s bullion production recently passed $1 million. Newcrest Mining Ltd has scheduled to ship 20,000 tonnes p.a. of gold-bearing copper concentrate to Burra. From this Burra’s copper leach and gold extraction process produces 3,500 tonnes of copper cement and 2 tonnes of gold bullion. The latter is sent to the Perth Mint for further refining. Tony Tindale, AdChem’s Burra Works Manager, said they were halfway through the first shipment of 5,000 tonnes and the second shipment is due to start arriving in late July. It comes from the Telfer Mine in inland WA and is shipped via Pt Headland and Pt Pirie. Mt Gunson, which has been Burra’s main source of oxidised ore for some years, has almost run out, making Burra dependent on Newcrest. Dennis Thamm will remain as caretaker mine manager at Mt Gunson for the foreseeable future. Bill Munro has been transferred to Burra as leading hand on the day shift, relieving Les Gardner, who has extended leave.</p>

<p>Redbanks</p>
<p>The Department of Environment &amp; Land Management is looking to offload crown land known as Redbanks. Unless an interested party can make use of it with adequate policing, it seems it will be sold off. DC Chairman Graham Kellock said the decision in a recent court action following a fatal accident at Redbanks indicated the landholder was at fault due to inadequate policing. The Council has tried to have an area there for picnicking, but the inability to control activities makes it impossible. Landowners in the area have been patient, but have been hard done by when off-roaders stray and damage fencing and property. Options have been considered and included negotiations with National Parks &amp; Wildlife, but so far no solutions have emerged.</p>
<p>A public meeting has been called for 21 July to gauge public interest. Police, SES and Ambulance have been called to accidents there in the past, some of which have involved alcohol and firearms. The area is at the junction of the King and Eastern stock roads and has never been privately owned.</p>

<p>The Merino Capital Committee met at its AGM on 6 July. President Don Griffen thanked Andrew Butler and Dave Parnell for their efforts in preparing the Pascoe Collection in the Tourist Office. Mr Griffen was amazed that the committee had not had more response from the community in its request for artefacts for our displays and disappointed that the Eastern Trips that were organised did not eventuate. It was decided to have an Eastern Promotion Trip on 22 August to promote the Eastern Pastoral Country to visitors.</p>

Thanks were expressed to Colleen Spackman who had been with the Association for 131⁄2 years and secretary for the past two. The Association has nearly 70 members. Among matters discussed was the obvious need for an ATM in Burra. This has become a necessity, especially with the continuing influx of tourists.</p>

<p>Redbanks</p>
<p>About 50 people attended the public meeting called to discuss the Redbanks area. DC Chairman Graham Kellock outlined a brief history of the area and of attempts to tackle the matter in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Mr Paul Tullock, District Manager for the Environment &amp; Land Management Department, said he would await the Council’s response on the future use and management of the property.</p>
<p>Mr Dennis Cock of the LGA Mutual Liability Scheme outlined strategies required for active use of the area, such as off-road vehicle use.</p>
<p>Paul Tullock said the case presently in the appeals Court and the potential for future incidents has ruled out motor bike use of the area.</p>
<p>The Department did not want to take on the area as a reserve as they have neither the money nor the rangers to staff it.</p>
<p>Bob Major of the Field Geology Club of SA described a report suggesting the western quarter should be a reserve to protect a couple of old gold mines, Aboriginal artefacts and the watercourse of the Baldina Creek.</p>
<p>Steve Pike, a previous squatter on the area, said a diprotodon had been taken from the area by the SA Museum and the area had definite archaeological significance.</p>
<p>Rob, a bike rider from Hackham asked why it couldn’t be run as an off-road park like Port Gawler, but it seemed from bike riders present that their case was spoilt by a hooligan element.</p>
<p>On a vote ten persons favoured an option involving some in favour of off-road vehicle use. Most favoured the whole area becoming a reserve under Council care with no off-road vehicles.</p>
<p>The option of grazing with no off-road vehicles and a reserve had no support.</p>
<p>The Council will give the matter further consideration.</p>
<p>Pages 1 &amp; 5</p>
<p>Mongolata Mine</p>
<p>Mr Kevin Wallis, manager, said plans were afoot to open the mine to tours within 18 months. The mine is on private land and was originally operated in the 1930s. Before it closed in 1954 the Mongolata Crusher had processed about 7,000 tons yielding 45 grams of gold per tonne. The gold battery, which was erected in 1933, will be restored using a battery from Tarcoola. There are old newspaper reports of a large lode. It is reported to be 7-10 metres wide at the water table with the assay yielding 150 grams per tonne, with visible gold in the samples. Kevin said there are plans to open up the ore body in the near future. The main mine was ‘Byles Mine’ and it goes 250 metres into the hill and was the largest producer on the field. Within it you can see the gold vault and ore chutes. The large three-compartment shaft is complete with a wooden headframe. Tourists will find an interesting mining history using traditional methods of recovering gold. Crushed ore passes over mercury plates where the gold forms an amalgam. This is then retorted to leave a gold sponge, which can be smelted to a gold bar. Any gold escaping this process is treated with cyanide and extracted from the solution using carbon.</p>

<p>The Season. This has been late, but rainfall has been adequate. A lot of burning was carried out in the district due to abnormal summer conditions with weeds and high stubble after unusual rain. Spoiled grain has provided plenty of feed for mice in some areas.</p>

<p>The Burra Mine</p>
<p>Some large holes have opened up on the edge of the re-timbered Morphett’s Shaft. They are large enough to swallow somebody and there are fears of further subsidence. The area has been fenced off and the Mine Museum Committee is awaiting a report from the Department of Mines and Energy with suggestions of how to solve the problem. The shaft was re-timbered in 1986 as part of the tourist attraction. The effect of retaining water in the infill has caused the subsidence and distorted some of the main timbers, although the structure appears sound on initial inspection.</p>

<p>Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard</p>
<p>Last year a pygmy bluetongue was found inside a dead Brown snake. Since then 50 live lizards have been found. The discovery was a remarkable coincidence. Who but a herpetologist would have stopped to examine a dead Brown snake on a roadside near Burra and then bother to dissect it to discover its most recent meal and who but a herpetologist would then identify that meal as a pigmy bluetongue lizard (Teliqua adelaidensis), a species not recorded since 1959?</p>
<p>Graham Armstrong and Julian Reid did just that last October. Anyone else would have just driven on. This exciting discovery resulted in an extensive search for more of the lizards.</p>
<p>Mark Hutchinson of the SA Museum found a second dead one, presumed to have been killed by a kestrel.</p>
<p>Funding was obtained from the Endangered Species Program and Tim Milne was employed to continue the survey. On 6 November 1992 the first live animal was seen in 33 years. Since then, over 50 have been found in three localities. In spring and summer most were males, presumably out looking for mates. Females and young were seen later in summer. It was found they lived in spider burrows rather than in logs or among rocks. Tim has been able to lure them out using grasshoppers on a rod and line to go ‘fishing’ for them. They are found in pastures on which grazing has occurred for 100 years, but seem to favour remnant Lomandra grassland of the rocky creek-lines, which have escaped the plough. These are a threatened community. The search for further colonies will continue and the life history, movements, behaviour and ecological requirements will now receive attention. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Country Roads need more funding. The rubble route to Morgan needs to be sealed. The Barrier Highway is narrow and while some sections have been remade, much is narrow and without a defining white line to mark its edge. Even a short distance from Burra township to the Morgan Road is yet to be sealed. Last Wednesday as an example of the difficulties a semi-trailer sank into the soft verge about ten km north of Manoora and only escaped turning over because the driver steered straight instead of trying to return to the sealed surface.

<p>Susan Roche writes re the old Post &amp; Telegraph Office.</p>
<p>The old Post &amp; Telegraph Office is to be placed on the market at the same time as Burra’s 150th anniversary. This is an opportunity for Burra people to gain access to a building for the first time in 30 years and to have a say in its future use. Burra has a rich history and the town needs a large building for the permanent display of paintings depicting its early days. The town already owns four valuable S.T. Gill watercolours, which are stored in the State Art Gallery because there is no suitable building to house them in Burra. Apart from a permanent display of art history there is enough space in the building for travelling SA Country Art Trust Exhibitions and for local artists’ exhibitions. The people of Burra are entitled to view their history displayed and their children given the opportunity to learn how their forefathers lived and what they achieved. Please support the Friends of the old Telegraph &amp; Post Office in their endeavours.</p>

<p>Australia Post, having adopted economic rationalism is now selling off properties all over Australia. The old Burra Post and Telegraph office, built in 1860* is to be sold. Mr Laver Manager of Australia Post said it had been used as a postmaster’s residence and was now surplus to requirements. The old building in Market Street has not operated as a Post Office for 30 years when the PMG Department (as it then was) built the new Post Office in Commercial Street in 1963.† The sale is expected to be announced within weeks.</p>
<p>[*Although the original building dated from 1860, it was rebuilt in 1911 and very little of the original structure remains.</p>
<p>†The new Post Office was opened in 1960; not 1963.]</p>

<p>Andrew Butler of the Burra Tourist Association led a six hour tour of the near rural area to the east to show to people the tourist potential with the possible spin-off that visitors would spend an extra night in the town. Merino breeding is the chief industry of the area and Andrew pointed out that in 1934 sheep sales in Burra were recorded with numbers of up to 44,000 in a single sale and a figure of 34,000 was recorded not so long ago.</p>
<p>What makes Mt Bryan sheep so great? The altitude, or the copper, or a mixture of environments in a small area? There was a shearing display at Don Griffen’s, the area’s most recently registered sheep stud. A special feature of the property is the air conditioned dust-free rooms used for artificial insemination and embryo transfer. The AI capability is 150 sheep a day. There was also a customized horn trimming race. The drop-off in rainfall as you crossed the range was explained and the area’s history was highlighted with reference to Goyder and old silver mines and there were some great views. Newikie Gorge was well suited for a barbecue lunch and there were many birds to be seen; apparently some 150 species inhabit the area. The tour went on to Panunda [Poonunda?] and Mongolata and called in on Robert Heading at Wildildie for a cuppa. There is potential to develop a tour along this sort of route.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC has been granted $20,000 to assist in the employment of a co-ordinator for the Main Street Program. Burra will be the first town to receive assistance from the combined resources of the Historic Towns Program of the Office of Tourism, Industry and Development and the Office of Business and Regional Development, the Main Street Manager Robert Jenkins said.</p>
<p>The program aims to maintain the economic health of the town while preserving its heritage. The community of Burra is crucial to the process. The community will be asked what it wants Burra to develop, what is needed to ensure Burra remains a great place to live, how it should look and how it is desired to project the town to visitors. This vision of the future will be the yardstick against which development and marketing will be assessed.</p>

<p>John Anderson, Deputy Leader of the National Party, addressed a disappointingly small group of wool growers at the Burra Sports Complex on the subject of the Garnaut Report. This exhaustive report addressed the management of the wool stockpile, the responsibilities of the various industry bodies and trade and market expansion initiatives. The goal is to develop a more market driven response to consumer demands. The report recommended the gradual reduction of wool industry bodies from four to one, privatisation after four years and better matching of supply and demand. Research, Development &amp; Promotion are suggested to be combined. Wool International Inc. would manage the disposal of the stockpile, discharge industry debt and develop risk management tools. Wool, Research &amp; Promotion would manage research and development and promotion. It seemed that the report was largely accepted by the few present in the absence of any alternative to discuss.</p>

<p>Speakers painted a picture of hard work ahead for the wool industry, but saw new markets and possibilities in the future. It was expected that [live sheep exports] to Saudi Arabia could rise to 500,000 p.a. and prices of young sheep could rise by up to $5 per head. Indonesia could perhaps take 30,000 in the next year. Rex Glennon said it was important buyers not find ‘extras’ in bales of wool purchased: we cannot afford to fill our bales with twine, dirt, seeds and bottles. China and the CIS will be major marketing areas for the next few years. Western Europe remains the largest customer – though often wool gets there via an in-between country.</p>

<p>ABC Documentary on Burra</p>
<p>When Burra was set up in 1845 it was Australia’s first mining town.* Early Burra was a fascinating study of how a community’s dependence on natural resources affects its economic role, structure, location, demographic and social characteristics. The documentary was able to use much surviving heritage to tell the early story. The account then takes in the transition from private mining town to a self-governing rural service centre and how people dealt with that transformation. More recently the town, in common with many other rural centres, has faced rural recession. The ABC crew of five spent six days in Burra to make the film and also spent time on rural properties. The documentary will air on 21 October.</p>
<p>[*This claim is hardly justified. Before 1845 coal had been mined in several places in NSW, what is now Queensland and in Tasmania. Even if the claim is for metal mining, Kapunda was mining copper more than a year before Burra started.]</p>

<p>Burra Senior Citizens’ Garden – the flood of early 1993 had almost reached the underside of the paving of the Kingston St Bridge and washed away much of the garden, especially the feature bed just south of the bridge. The Council had replaced soil and the bed was replanted. The garden occupies a strip about 150 m long and gives a pleasing foreground to Paxton Square cottages [as well as to the park south of the bridge.]</p>

<p>Main Street Program</p>
<p>The Burra Burra DC needs the co-operation of main street traders and residents to carry out this program. Burra Traders President Jenny Field expressed enthusiasm and urged all shopkeepers and members of the public to participate in the public meeting later this month.</p>
<p>The regeneration process has already started in parts of the US, Canada, NSW and Queensland.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the program are:</p>
<p>Develop or redevelop centres suffering downturn</p>
<p>Create jobs by carrying out necessary work or in consequence of improved trading</p>
<p>Improve the appearance of main streets</p>
<p>Encourage self-help development and community involvement</p>
<p>The local community must decide whether to proceed with the proposals.</p>
<p>For many country centres business growth depends on attracting outside trade. Local buying power is already stretched to the limit and probably declining as commodity prices fall.</p>

<p>The Red Shed Company will present the acclaimed comedy-drama ‘Sweetown’ at Burra Town Hall on Friday 29 October. Melissa Reeve’s play was first produced in late 1991 and is set in 1965 in a country town. The local historical society, CWA, Apex and the school are researching for events to put the town on the map. Unexpectedly they uncover a long-buried atrocity against the region’s Aborigines. This provokes a conflict between those who want to bury the past and those who wish to integrate it into their lives so they can go forward.</p>

<p>The Explorer Train will not come to Burra. It will travel only as far north as Riverton. Ms Christina Holmdale, Public Affairs Manager for Australia National made this announcement on 6 October.</p>

<p>Placer Exploration Ltd is commencing a drilling program in King Well and Barker’s Dam areas east of Burra. A series of reconnaissance holes will be drilled at selected locations in the Hundreds of King and Rees and in the Out of Hundreds area immediately to their east. Existing tracks will be used wherever possible and no earthworks or track construction is envisaged where tracks are not available. Silver City Drilling has been contracted for the drilling using an aircore rig. Drilling was expected to begin in mid-October and last about two weeks. [Map printed.]</p>

<p>Local Developments</p>
<p>At BCS works are under way for the $380,000 swimming pool.</p>
<p>At Burra Hospital builders have begun additions to the Boarding Facility – formerly the Nurses’ Home. DEET has allocated over $130,000 for the project. When completed the Boarding Facility will have a dining area, another toilet and shower area, a recreation area and another bedroom.</p>
<p>At the Commercial Hotel the demolition of an old store room has brought to light a lovely old stone cottage, thought to be part of the original hotel building. $20,000 is being spent on this restoration project.</p>
<p>Theft. Some $400 worth of floorboards has been stolen from a disused house near Farrell Flat.</p>

<p>The Main Street Program meeting last Thursday drew about 40 interested people. Speakers were:</p>
<p>Robert Jenkins of the Main Street Program</p>
<p>Harry Bechervaise, architect, who has worked with the program.</p>
<p>Douglas Alexander, Heritage Advisor to the Burra Burra DC.</p>
<p>Mr Jenkins said revitalising Burra’s main street can be done while protecting its cultural heritage. The plan would involve design, heritage, business development, promotions and marketing. Many centres in Australia and overseas have been through the process with impressive results. A slide show illustrated places where the program had been implemented and also some of Burra’s impressive as well as some of its less attractive features.</p>
<p>Audrey Nankivell has 23 years’ service at Burra Hospital as an enrolled nurse, with much of that time on night duty. She received a presentation recently in appreciation of her service. Ron Thamm represented the Hospital Board and John Brak attended as the new Chairman with John Chilton CEO.</p>

<p>BCS School Council held its AGM on Monday night.</p>
<p>Chairman Chris Reed outlined developments in the Agricultural Program.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to begin the program in Year 7 with a basic Science-Agricultural view of plants and animals. Years 8-10 cover agricultural enterprises and domains. Years 11 &amp; 12 present a more intensive approach. Year 12 in 1994 for example will include genetics and animal breeding, crop husbandry and technology and a new unit on aquaculture. The school has leased the ‘Kookaburra’ property from Dick Cleland, enabling students to be involved with agriculture on a broader scale. 80 acres have been sown; 48 in Janz wheat and 32 in lupins. Barley will be introduced next year into the rotation for use in supplementary feeding of steers in future years. Some of the area that is unsuitable for grazing will see a tree planting program of 500 trees. A grant is being sought to establish a yabby-marron farm.</p>
<p>The school canteen made a strong profit.</p>
<p>The Board of Management is offering an award of up to $1,000 for the Burra Burra J150 Research Award to foster research into the history of Burra and District.</p>
<p>The School Community News Committee reported that the last issue would be that of 22 December 1993, ending sixteen years of service reporting life and events in Burra. It filled an important role when the Burra Record ceased publication.</p>
<p>The Community Swimming Pool is progressing on schedule. Concreting of the pool itself should be completed this week. So far $60,000 of the $380,000 has been spent. It is hoped the pool will be completed in late January or early February. The pool will not be available for swimming classes this season.</p>

<p>Accidents</p>
<p>A semi-trailer carting hay lost six bales on the highway near Porters Lagoon during the week. Fortunately other traffic managed to avoid them.</p>
<p>A two car collision occurred on the highway at the East Bungaree turn-off near Mt Bryan on Saturday morning. Damage was extensive, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>Burra Railway</p>
<p>A train driver called the ‘Broadcaster’ office a few weeks ago while waiting to truck out a long load of grain. He said the track was in good condition and in fact was better than most country lines. ‘I don’t know why all the restrictions are on it.’ There would seem to be no good reason why special passenger trains can’t visit Burra.</p>

<p>Burra Burrs DC, 30 November</p>
<p>It was resolved to abolish the three committees managing the Burra Tourist Office, Paxton Square and Morphett’s Engine House Museum and replace them with a single committee. A Tourist Executive Officer will be appointed to be responsible for the overall management of the Council’s tourist properties. Chairman Graham Kellock said the change was needed for the Council to advance to the next stage in developing and operating the tourist facilities and was not a reflection on the performance or commitment of the committees.</p>

<p>Tim Stockman has received one of the ‘Nescafe Big Break’ grants of $20,000.</p>
<p>Tim (20), from a farming family, has decided to make his goal the making of technology accessible to the average farmer by using his considerable skill in electronics. His first innovation is a device to monitor the amount of farming chemical applied to crops by boom spray. Present systems are inefficient and costly and although there is a computer device on the market, which increases efficiency, it is expensive and complicated to use. Tim is determined to overcome these disadvantages and also to make the system safer. The old system uses hoses full of chemicals, which can burst and shower the user with toxic chemicals. Tim’s electronic device will eliminate the need for chemicals to be present in the cabin and eliminate overdosing.</p>
<p>Tim has already set up his own electronics repair business, but the grant will give him the kick start needed to finalise the project and further his research and development work.</p>

<p>Manoora Anglican Church was deconsecrated on Sunday 4 December after almost 129 years of services. About 60 people attended the service conducted by Rev. Peter Linn of the Anglican Parish of Auburn-Riverton. The Education Department has purchased the land and building as extra room for the Manoora Primary School to house drama and library facilities.</p>
<p>The Church of Emmanuel was consecrated in October 1864. The church’s formal name was the Church of England, Church of Emmanuel, Chingford. It was built of local stone. In 1905 it was upgraded and the chancel was paved in Mintaro slate. The furnishings will be distributed to other Anglican churches and three stained glass windows will be replaced and it is hoped will be retained at a suitable place in Manoora. They commemorate Mary Anne &amp; Jabez Frost, James Jones and the Byerlee Family. The closure of the church became inevitable when only three families were attending the bi-monthly services.</p>

<p>The copper-gold concentrate roaster was immobilised in October when part of its roof gave way and fell into the internal workings. Since then the company has carried out extensive maintenance, but a decision to spend money on upgrading the plant has been deferred till middle or late January according the General Manager Mark Woodhead.</p>
<p>Those improvements are required to reduce the cost of copper raw material used in producing copper oxide, in order to remain competitive with copper prices at a seven year low. The copper concentrate treatment plant is most profitable when copper prices are good, but at present with prices low and requests for money from other areas of the Parent group’s operations, obtaining funds for the upgrade has given the board a difficult decision. Any decision to downgrade or suspend operations would have serious implications for district employment. The production of copper oxide, the company’s core product line would not be affected should concentrate treatment be suspended.</p>
<p>The Season. The crops in the district this year are generally up in both yield and quality, with only isolated areas showing frost or hail damage. Harvest seems to be a week or so later this year. Canola has done well and if barley prices remain low more will turn to canola next season.</p>

<p>SES thanks those who donated old batteries and so helped in getting the funds to replace the radio stolen in January.</p>
<p>Burra Burra DC Chairman Graham Kellock issued his Christmas message:</p>
<p>1993 started as a rather trying year, with heavy unseasonal rains, which ruined crops and damaged the road network. As the year went by roads were repaired, but this expense has set back the works budget. Thanks are due to the volunteers who worked so hard on the night of the 25 January to save the town from more damage. In May the Council elections produced just one change; Cr Kevin Wallis replaced Cr Bob Heath.</p>
<p>A major development this year has been the building of the new swimming pool. This has proved very costly and tenders were higher than expected, but it has been made possible by a Federal Government grant of $100,000. The high maintenance costs have prevented the re-opening of the old pool and the new one should open in February. Council is a member of the Mid North Development Board and this aims to aid development and industry in the area. Last Saturday saw the election of a Liberal State Government with a large swing. I remind people that this Government will have to be reminded of promises made while in opposition regarding the sealing of the Spalding-Burra-Morgan Road.</p>

<p>Obituary. Marlene Kay Burton 30 January 1944 to 15 December 1993.</p>
<p>Mrs Burton died as the result of a traffic accident when struck by a car while a pedestrian on South Road at Black Forest last Wednesday. She leaves a husband, Jack, and four children. Mrs Burton was born in Adelaide and lived in Mt Bryan with her husband. With farming, shearing and bee-keeping, they built a house for their family. Their elder daughter, Darylee, is a double certificated nurse. She and her husband, Garry Pelletier, returned to Adelaide last year from Hawaii, where they had lived since their marriage.</p>
<p>In November this year their elder son, Wayne, completed a degree at Adelaide University in Agricultural Science and is employed as a Research officer at Minnipa on Eyre Peninsula. He hopes to go on to complete his PhD. Younger son, Danny, has attended Norwood senior High School for the last two years and has just completed Matriculation. He hopes to go on to tertiary studies in business or physiotherapy. Daughter Julie completed her studies at BCS in 1990 and has been living for two years in England. Accompanied by John Mackenzie from Kent, she returned to Mt Bryan to spend Christmas with her family just a week before her mother died.</p>
<p>Arian Garret in giving the Eulogy for Marlene described her as a most caring and generous person who was talented and participated vigorously in family and community life. She was well known and respected throughout the district. For many years she drove the school bus on the Hallett-Burra run. She was dedicated to planting trees in the district and the people of Mt Bryan are arranging for a grove of trees to be named in her honour as a dedication to her commitment to Greening Australia. These trees and the many she planted will be a lasting memorial to Mrs Burton.</p>

<p>‘The Burra School &amp; Community News’ – A Tribute</p>
<p>This began in 1978 following the demise of the Burra Record. For the first time in 100 years Burra did not have a paper of its own and many felt it had lost its voice. What happens and is recorded becomes tomorrow’s history. Chris McCabe, the new Principal of the new BCS and his wife Denise came up with the idea of the ‘Burra School and Community News’. At first it appeared fortnightly – typed, laid out and printed at the school by Cynthia Burnett. Early illustrations were hand drawn by Mary Woollacott.</p>
<p>In 1978 BCS was new. It had an SRC, a Parents &amp; Friends’ Association, a School Council and staff. The buildings were named after the original villages from the copper mining days. Ron Thamm was Chairman of the School Council. The school was officially opened in April 1978. The total enrolment was 456. There were Community Weeks and film evenings and a Buy-a-Brick Campaign to get a reasonable sized gymnasium.</p>
<p>The gymnasium was constantly in use for PE lessons, lunch-time recreation, after school hours public meetings, badminton, volley ball, ballet classes, fitness groups and basketball. Edith Carpenter co-ordinated school and community demands.</p>
<p>The National Hang Gliding Championships were held in Burra that year.</p>
<p>In July ‘Joseph and Technicolour Dreamcoat’ was staged at the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Ian &amp; Margaret Allen were farewelled.</p>
<p>200 people attended the opening of the Burra Community Library and State Library Board Chairman Jim Crawford was guest speaker.</p>
<p>The local entertainment group produced ‘Viva Mexico’ in October 1978.</p>
<p>The Burra Conservation Study display was set up in Adelaide and opened by Justice Roma Mitchell.</p>
<p>Porters Lagoon had its own Progress Association.</p>
<p>The large painting in the staff room comprising four panels by former Art teacher Russell Philip was hung.</p>
<p>Another large theatrical production that year was ‘Afternoon at the Seaside’, which was accompanied by a production of ‘Trial by Jury’.</p>
<p>[Performers etc. are listed.]</p>
<p>In June 1978 the school newsletter took on a more community role and was more widely distributed, being made available from stores in Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett. Publication became weekly during school terms. The School Council purchased an offset press for $6,000.</p>
<p>Over the next sixteen years the size and colour of the newsletter changed, but its basic concept remained the same. It carried news from the school, the community and the Council. It advertised fund-raising events and had a diary of events and church notices. There was plenty of sport, a chat column and library news as well as photos. In short it became a comprehensive newspaper.</p>
<p>Soon Cynthia Burnett needed volunteer typists and Jan Jacka and Di Cameron were the first to offer. Denise McCabe took up the challenge of layout. Sue Gebhardt became Chief Editor. Gradually the numbers involved in all aspects of publication increased. [A long list of those involved is printed.]</p>
<p>Chronological Highlights:</p>
<p>1978 – The newsletter began. Burra Apex Club bought equipment such as electric typewriters etc. and continued its support until it disbanded in 1990, when it gave a final donation of $1,300.</p>
<p>1987 – The school printery closed and the newsletter was commercially printed. In this year a grant of $1,000 from the State Bank helped with equipment.</p>
<p>1991 – David Maher redesigned the logo on the front page. The newsletter survived on donations and sponsorship – especially from Apex, Burra Traders’ Association and the Council. It was distributed to each school family and to stores in Burra, Booborowie and Mt Bryan, to Farrell Flat Hotel and for a time at Hallett. It was also posted to readers interstate, in Adelaide and in other country areas.</p>
<p>[The current production team was then listed.]</p>
<p>It has sometimes been of more than 20 pages and is much to the credit of the community that it survived for 16 years.</p>
<p>Now that Burra again has its own newspaper the ‘Burra Broadcaster’, rather than duplicate news and the effort, the Community Newsletter has finished its job and has made way for the commercial enterprise to succeed.</p>

<p>The Booborowie Annual School Concert was a terrific success this year.</p>
<p>The Terowie Uniting Church held a closing service attended by about 100 people. Rev. Clem Christopher was the guest speaker. He was in Terowie in 1939. The church was opened in 1882 and was built by Sara &amp; Dunstan at a cost of £1,150. The architect was Mr F.W. Dancker of Adelaide. Much of the furnishings were by a local, Mr Tuck.</p>

<p>The Commercial Hotel has undergone recent renovations. The intention was to establish a beer garden next to the hotel in Commercial Street. When the façade next to the hotel was removed it revealed some of the best stonework in Burra in a cottage set back from the street. The cottage has one wall in common with the hotel and is thus thought to have been built at the same time. The Commercial Hotel was opened on Wednesday 6 September 1876 ‘but no great stir was made on that occasion’ according to the Northern Mail at the time.</p>
<p>In 1893 Daisy Kennedy, reputedly the greatest violinist of her day, was born in the hotel. She made a return visit with her brother in 1964 to have a last look, as she said, at the hotel where she was born and at the house in Kangaroo Street (now occupied by Mr &amp; Mrs M.W. Eberhard) where she lived while her father was headmaster of the Burra School 1892-95. Her brother A.L. Kennedy, who accompanied her to Burra, achieved fame also; as one of Mawson’s companions on his Antarctic journeys. He later surveyed a vast area of the Kimberley, becoming one of Australia’s leading geologists and mineralogists. Present owners of the Commercial have now presented their hotel frontage as a Burra showpiece, featuring the beer garden with the quaint cottage backdrop.</p>

<p>Harry Quinn is this year’s Australia Day Citizen of the Year. He came to the Booborowie district in about 1950 after flying as a wireless operator in the RAAF in WWII. He has given dedicated service to the local community ever since. As a Board Member of the Burra Hospital for 32 years, including ten years as Chairman, Harry hardly missed a meeting. He strove to maintain services and upgrade the building and facilities. He represented the hospital on various committees and health related associations. He also served as councillor for Booborowie on the Burra Burra DC for 16 years from 1959 to 1975. He was a foundation member of the Booborowie Bowling Club in 1954, President 1968-75 and again 1992-3 and a member of the Booborowie Tennis Club 1950-65. He served on the Booborowie Hall Committee 1956-79 and was president 1965-67 and was a member of the Booborowie School Council 1957-77. He has been involved with the Catholic Church Council since 1966 and with the Booborowie RSL Sub-branch from 1954 to its closure in 1982; 11 years as Secretary, 3 as President and 4 as Vice-President. He has travelled many thousands of kilometres and spent thousands of hours in community service over the years.</p>

<p>The BCS Boarding House has been chosen as the Event of the Year for Australia Day. The need for a larger boarding facility arose when BCS attracted more students requiring board than was available. Burra is seen as a good place for outback students to receive a good education with caring staff in a school with excellent buildings and library and other facilities.</p>
<p>With the sanction of the School Council a sub-committee was set up to explore possibilities and negotiations began to see if the vacant nurses’ quarters could be used. The Hospital Board was agreeable and a lease was signed. The next step was to refurbish the quarters. On a Saturday before school began, a working bee was held and many people turned up to arrange furniture and organise rooms. The children arrived on the Sunday. The Uniting Church Op Shop made a donation to enable the purchase of linen and furniture and the Isolated Children’s Parents’ Association also gave a donation and so did the Eastern Districts’ Progress Association and the Variety Club. Other individuals gave donations and school staff volunteered to help with homework sessions. A DEET Hostel grant for a building extension became available. The Burra Burra DC agreed to apply on behalf of the boarding facility for the grant for a much needed dining room, kitchen and bathrooms. The application was successful and the Council received $128,000. The work has all been done by local tradesmen – Rob Jacka and local sub-contractors. The Council also made a donation of $5,000 to help establish the boarding house. The future of the facility looks bright. Bookings have been received for places up to 2005 and next year it will be filled to capacity.</p>

A shake-up in tourism was needed: days spent in SA by interstate and overseas visitors had decreased by 16% and hotel-motel occupancy was barely 50%. The reasons for the merging of Yorke Peninsula and the Mid North, however, seemed to fail to convince listeners.</p>

<p>The Lewis Board of Management met for their final meeting on 10 February. The Board is being disbanded under the Council’s restructuring of its tourism operations. Formerly the Lewis Trust, the Board has overseen the restoration and administration of Paxton Square for many years. In the late 1970s Burra was receiving much favourable comment as a visitor destination, its heritage was acknowledged and the scene was set for a developing tourist industry, but accommodation was a problem. After a decade of restoration the square set the scene for this type of accommodation and since then many cottage bed and breakfast establishments have been set up in Burra. The Burra Motor Inn has come on stream as well. Burra is now well served with accommodation. The entire Paxton Square is booked out for Easter, when the Riley Car Club will be in residence. Some of the many involved in the square’s restoration have been Andrew Gebhardt, Bob Lewis, the late Ted Baulderstone and the late Brian Bevan. Shortly the Burra Burra DC expects to appoint a Tourism Executive Officer to oversee the management of the Council’s Tourism ventures, of which Paxton Square is but one.</p>

<p>AdChem announced today it was suspending part of its copper treating operations at Burra, with a consequent loss of 46 jobs. The concentrate treatment facility will be placed on a care and maintenance basis as a result of the short supply of copper concentrate around the world. This has made smelters fiercely competitive for toll smelting and has made AdChem’s operations here uneconomic. The decision was announced at Burra by AdChem’s General Manager Mr Mark Woodhead.</p>
<p>He also said the production of the company’s main source of income, copper oxide, would not be affected and the company would continue to employ about 40 staff at the plant.</p>
<p>AdChem is the world’s largest producer of copper oxide and exports to more than 25 countries. 90% if the copper oxide is exported to be used in electronics, timber preservation and agriculture. Although the concentration process has been suspended, the company says it has identified sources of copper-bearing materials which could be amenable for treatment through part of the existing plant. A development program is being instituted.</p>

<p>Richard Holbrook writes re the decision of Council that from 28 February the 1995 Committee called the Burra Tourist Association would no longer exist. This committee comprised representatives from the following committees:</p>
<p>Burra National Trust</p>
<p>Burra Mine Museum</p>
<p>Burra Traders</p>
<p>The Lewis Board</p>
<p>Merino Capital</p>
<p>Mid North Tourist Association</p>
<p>Jubilee 150</p>
<p>Plus three members of the community and the Burra Burra DC representative.</p>
<p>The decision was made behind closed doors without consultation. The Council does not seem to have considered that the move jeopardises the Passport Key.</p>
<p>Such action promotes a lack of confidence from the community.</p>
<p>Council says it has made the move in order to take ‘the next step’, but what that is lacks definition because they either cannot or will not answer questions put to them.</p>
<p>Restructuring of the tourism industry may well be needed, but what right has the Council to act unilaterally without consulting the people who form an integral part of the tourism infrastructure?</p>

<p>The Main Street Program</p>
<p>Rob Jenkins of the program addressed a group of 40 interested persons on Thursday night. As a result Mr Stephen Angel will distribute an enquiry sheet to local bodies and individuals to establish the common needs and aspirations of private, commercial and rural interests. The sheet will seek to identify the best and worst aspects of Burra. One issue highlighted was that on the same night there were three meetings in progress with similar aims and Mr Jenkins suggested some co-ordination was needed.</p>

<p>N.B. Lewis writes asking if anybody can assist in identifying which are the ruins of the childhood farm home of Sir Hubert Wilkins. Sir Hubert made the first flight over the Arctic from Alaska to Spitsbergen in 1928 and also the first flight in Antarctica in the summer of 1928-29. The ruins are pictured in the Australian Geographic of October-December 1992 on page 119. I have no idea to what extent, if at all, Wilkins is part of local history, because he spent most of his life abroad. He has been more esteemed in the USA than in his homeland.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC has released information about the Council’s Tourism Resources. A committee of seven Councillors will:</p>
<p>Be responsible for management and promotion of Council owned Tourism Resources.</p>
<p>Undertake promotion in conjunction with other interested groups, like the National Trust, the Regional Tourist Association and local traders.</p>
<p>Exercise delegated powers to spent funds and make decisions, including staff appointments.</p>
<p>A Burra Tourism Executive officer will be appointed on a two-year contract with responsibilities including:</p>
<p>Management and supervision of operations at the Tourist Office, Paxton Cottages, the Mine Museum and the caravan Park.</p>
<p>Promotion of Council facilities.</p>
<p>The presentation of regular reports and recommendations.</p>
<p>Consultation with local interest groups and traders.</p>
<p>Other staff:</p>
<p>Tourist Office – 3 part-time counter staff</p>
<p>Secretary – 1 half time employee</p>
<p>Handyman – 1 half-time employee</p>
<p>Paxton Cottages – 1 caretaker and 3 casual cleaners</p>
<p>Caravan Park – 1 caretaker</p>
<p>Mine Museum – 3 casual guides</p>
<p>It is estimated that the extra costs to change the management structure would be $8,000 in the first year.</p>
<p>Since Geoff and Sylvia Pearce retired the Council has operated the Caravan Park with a minimum of staff and effort. Without an on-site manager the use of the park has declined and some complaints have been received.</p>
<p>The Various Section 199 Committees held their last meetings in February. Council will be receiving a report from each committee recommending future action with reminders of forward planning undertaken and possible projects and commitments already made. A mixed reaction has been evident in comments passed on to Council and although it is regrettable that some people feel ‘left out’, Council will still need the support of the comments during this new stage of developing the Council’s tourism.</p>

<p>Burra Swimming Pool</p>
<p>It was decided at last Week’s meeting that the pool would be open to the public as soon as gates were installed on the gymnasium verandah and this is being worked towards in haste. The meeting decided that the school could use the pool for swimming activities, which have included swimming lessons. More trees will be planted and further landscaping will occur between the bus bay and the canteen. The site is to be smoke-free.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC’s assessment valuations have risen by 2.13% this year. Rural values are largely static, but properties in towns rose significantly.

<p>Des Woolley writes asserting that the position of failed and partly failed business ventures in the district is due to the Council – expansion plans have been denied or restricted or smothered in red tape and conditions. It was a sad day when the town came under the Heritage Act and made worse by the insidious Main Street Program. Recently a circus was denied (so I am told) the right to set up in Burra. The Council imposes restrictive practices and over regulation to the detriment of the town.</p>
<p>[The editor comments that the circus was given permission to use the oval, but decided against going ahead with the fixture.]</p>
<p>Lucy Krause (10) writes on behalf of children in the district complaining that they have nothing to do. There was no swimming pool this year. The playgrounds are no fun and the circus was cancelled.</p>
<p>Issue 153, 23 March 1994, page 3</p>
<p>Circus Royale</p>
<p>[An article elaborates on the Circus Royale situation – saying that permission to use the oval was given despite concerns that heavy equipment could cause damage, as it had done in a case several years earlier. Circus representatives offered a $500 bond and permission was then given, but the management then pulled out.</p>

<p>The Redbanks Committee has been formed. Redbanks is a very diverse area geologically and has interesting flora and fauna. The Council wants to have it open to the public by 1995.</p>
<p>The Committee has the task of forming an Area Management Plan to present to Council. Members of the public will be asked for their comments. The reserve was closed by the SA Government in 1992 due to injury claims, etc. A public meeting in 1993 recommended the Burra Burra DC should accept responsibility for the future of the reserve and as it was community land it should not be sold for farming use. The use of motor bikes on the reserve was generally condemned. Council accepted this recommendation. An interim caretaker has been appointed. Steve Kerrigan, District Clerk, said the Council took on the reserve on the condition that no off-road vehicles be allowed back into the area and so the committee will not be considering this question.</p>

<p>Supplement</p>
<p>Main Street Update</p>
<p>The object is to revitalise the town by providing what the community wants. Initially funded by the State Government, it eventually becomes self-funding and has no ties to local government. When community input and involvement comes together funding will be made available by the State Government and this must be used to employ a co-ordinator. At the last public meeting thirty-seven people attended. A motion was passed that each person would circulate ten questionnaires. The response has so far been very positive. One question refers to the name ‘Main Street’ and asks what you would prefer to see it called. Suggestions have been:</p>
<p>Burra Development Plan</p>
<p>Better Business Plan</p>
<p>Burra Alive</p>
<p>Burra Community Improvement Program</p>
<p>Make Burra Beautiful</p>

<p>Community Health Needs Survey recently produced a good response rate of 43%. The survey sought to identify knowledge of current health services, use of health services and future health needs.</p>
<p>Most respondents were satisfied with the services received. There was some dissatisfaction concerning shortage of services by GP, dieticians, for mental health and in home care services. The major needs were identified as:</p>
<p>A female GP</p>
<p>A Women’s Health Clinic</p>
<p>An additional male GP</p>
<p>An upgraded accident and emergency department.</p>
<p>The possibility of a visiting female GP is being discussed.</p>
<p>An upgrade of the Casualty, X-Ray and Treatment-Recovery section of the hospital is due to begin in mid-1994. A range of other services were seen as ‘desirable’. [Listed.]</p>

<p>Ian Auhl writes:</p>
<p>During a recent visit from Cr Colleen Woodgate I learnt that BCS has no qualified secondary History teacher. If this means that no History is being taught at BCS, it needs rectifying. Australian History should be part of the curriculum and I would be dismayed to find that no local History was being taught at some stage of schooling in Burra. Much has been achieved by a series of locals in the protection, preservation and restoration of Burra’s sites and buildings. But it should be remembered that the basis for this work has always been historical research. Ongoing research is needed for example into the historic roads to Burra (undertaken by Mr R.J. Noye of Clare) or the story of Burra since 1877 or the history of the Burra Smelting Works. Of concern too should be Burra’s claim to be the Merino Capital of the World, which currently seems to be based on little except the assertion that ‘the Collinsville Merino Stud consistently receives record prices for rams’. (Tourist Brochure)</p>
<p>What item is there in Burra to show a tourist who is interested in the ‘Merino Capital’ idea?</p>
<p>‘At present it seems to me that the title (dating from 1987) was [an] after thought riding not so much on the merino’s back but on Burra’s role as a historic mining town.’</p>

<p>BCS. Reports on 5BCS’s test broadcast are coming in. The signal seems to have been heard easily around the town and along the by-pass road.

<p>Burra Gardening Group met last Friday at ‘Kookaburra’ where Mrs Barbara Rayner of ‘The Bluff’ Hallett spoke on trees. The group has been meeting for some four months after Helen Cleland of ‘Kookaburra’ floated the idea. It is an informal gathering of those who enjoy swapping knowledge, cuttings, bulbs, etc. and generally learning about growing plants in this particular climatic area.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>Following on from the Health Towards 2000 Needs Survey, comes the Audit Commission Report on Health in SA and a new funding model called Casemix Funding, which will be introduced into most hospital, including Burra, from July. Recommendations from the Needs Survey are in the process of being adopted, said John Chilton, Hospital CEO on Monday. A recent advertisement for an additional Mental Health Professional in the region did not attract an applicant and will be readvertised. This was an unmet need in the survey. The Hospital will be preparing a Local Services Register for distribution. The Audit Commission has other recommendations yet to be adopted. Regionalisation of services is recommended and is favoured by the Government. Consequences for small hospitals like Burra are unknown, but it seems likely that some core services like surgery would be centralised, giving smaller hospitals more of a primary care role. From 1 July 1994 hospitals will be more competitive and there will be casualties among hospitals not patronised by their local communities or which are identified as inefficient. Under Casemix Funding the hospitals will only be paid for what they do. It will be a case of use it or lose it.</p>
<p>Pascoe Photographs</p>
<p>The Pascoe Collection of stud sheep photographs is currently on display upstairs in the Burra Tourist Office.

<p>Editorial. The local St John volunteers do a great job, but when a casualty needs to go to Adelaide they get a bill or around $740 – quite a hefty amount considering there is no labour cost involved. When the hospital transfers someone they too get a hefty bill. A few years ago many country areas ran their own ambulance service and the local boards ran a tight ship. It is time we looked at the economics of a private ambulance service looking after the district.</p>

<p>T. Swann BA (Hons), Dip Ed. writes for BCS staff.</p>
<p>Mr Auhl should do a little of his own research. He would find that BCS has no shortage of trained secondary History teachers and that History is well represented in the curriculum. Chris Collins and myself are both University trained History teachers applying our trade in the senior secondary level. A group of committed Humanities teachers teach History at other levels. At BCS students are acquainted with local History from a very early age and have a good skills base by the time they get to secondary History. Years 8-10 are taught general History, which includes local History. Year 11 students are required to take Australian Studies and can also elect to do Modern World History. At Year 12 we offer PES Australian History.</p>
<p>What is disappointing ‘About Mr Auhl’s letter is that he is publicly repeating ill-informed gossip, which tends to undermine the very group he should be supporting.’</p>
<p>‘If anyone has concern about the curriculum delivered at BCS, I suggest their first step should be to contact the school and find out exactly what is being taught.’</p>
<p>BCS. Fifty-four people including staff, bus drivers, relieving teachers, swimming pool manager and eleven physical education students completed a six-hour Basic Casualty Care Training Session on Friday, run by Allison Tandy and Eunice Mills. Friday 13 was a student free day to enable this to be run – staff are required to update their training every two years. There will be a combined Lower North Schools Training and Development Day on 20 June, which has been negotiated with the School Council as a student free day. The planned strike by the SA Institute of Teachers Union on 24 May will not affect BCS as union members here voted not to take part.</p>

<p>Robert G. Skinner &amp; Glenys J. Christopher write on the galah problem in Burra.</p>
<p>An article in the Northern Argus of 18 May says that the Burra Burra DC has invited comments from the public on the control of galahs. The birds are roosting in gum trees around Burra Creek and the trees are beginning to die. The article says Council feels there is not much point in planting trees if we cannot look after the ones we have. The solution is for the Council to implement a positive program and put in 5,000 trees immediately. At Ford’s Corner we have planted 2,000 in three years and expect to plant another 500 to 600 this year.</p>
<p>Ian Auhl OAM, BA writes an apologetic letter to BCS concerning his previous statements about History teaching at the school and also to Cr Colleen Woodgate.</p>
<p>‘Evidently I misheard or misinterpreted a chance remark the Councillor made in reply to a query of mine.’</p>
<p>‘I don’t think that Mr Swann can, however, accuse me of a lack of support for Burra’s history teachers.’</p>
<p>‘If, over the past eight years or so, just one of Burra’s teachers of history had thought to contact me to say whether they found by Burra books (and likewise my Burra research collection) useful in teaching their subject, when [sic: for then] perhaps I might not have made such an old fool of myself.’</p>
<p>‘Likewise there has been no response to the recent ABC TV Video ‘Living Australia, Burra’ in which both my research and myself were involved.’</p>

They worked on Saturday digging out soil build-up on the floors and replastering eroded walls. On Sunday they took advantage of the Burra passport to explore the town’s heritage sites.</p>

<p>Obituary. Mabel Caroline Augusta Stolte 19 September 1910 to 2 June 1994.</p>
<p>Mrs Stolte was the daughter of Alfred &amp; Jane Phillips. She lived all her life in the Mt Bryan District and devoted herself to doing good for everyone. She attended Mt Bryan School and was later involved in many activities in the town and district. In younger life she was a capable tennis player, winning a number of trophies. In October 1934 she married Frederick Charles Stolte in Mt Bryan Methodist Church (now the Sunday school). They had forty-five years of marriage and raised four children, Beth, Heather, Murray and Jill. As well as helping her husband on the farm, she cared for her mother in her declining years. Her culinary and dressmaking skills aided many organisations over the years. She cooked and sewed for trading tables to raise money for building the Mt Bryan Church and was a long-time member of the Methodist (later Uniting) Church Guild. She knitted and packed parcels for the FFCF and after the war was a member of the Red Cross and the CWA. She was a member of the school Welfare Club for many years and a prize winner at many Burra Shows in baking and sewing. She was a widow for almost fourteen years. She had eleven grandchildren and fifteen great grandchildren. [Born and died at Burra.]</p>

<p>Terowie Uniting Church</p>
<p>With the closure of the church the Citizens’ Association has been speaking with the Peterborough Parish Council to reach an agreement for the Association to obtain title to the property. The aim was to keep it as a heritage building and prevent it from being developed as a residence or commercial property. Though sympathetic, the Council needs to obtain what it can when the building is sold and therefore will soon put it up for tender. Originally the Wesleyan Church, work commenced on the building in 1882 and opening services were held on 2 March 1883. The final service was on 19 December 1993. An interesting history of the church and Sunday school is given in the May issue of Terowie Enterprise.</p>

<p>Brian Moore of the Botanic Gardens Adelaide contributes an item on the question of whether Burra’s hills were always bald.</p>
<p>In 1846 John Ainsworth Horrocks noted that near present day Yacka there was very little wood for the fire and he noted that just north of Wirrabara the hills to the west were well timbered, while to the east they were open and well grassed. Thomas Fisher in 1851 described the road north of Kapunda as passing through undulating park-like country and an extensive plain. About eight miles before Burra he said it becomes very barren and hilly. He described the hills to the north of the Burra Mines as rounded and bald. The first surveyors of the district indicated that at least two thirds of the area was virtually devoid of trees and the vegetation was open and grassy. Today little of this grassland exists and remnants are degraded and invaded by exotic weeds. No grasslands are protected in conservation parks. The Biological Conservation Branch of the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources has proposed a survey of native grassland and of grassy woodland communities in the Mid North, to run over two years.</p>

<p>Notice. District Council of Burra Burra</p>
<p>Public Meeting, 14 July, Commercial Hotel, to discuss future tourist promotions and marketing.</p>
<p>Letter. T. Swan, BCS English Teacher, writes in response to concerns expressed about the suitability of Archie Weller’s book Going Home as a school text. It has been asserted that the book promotes immorality, unsafe sex, racism and prurient thoughts etc. In fact swearing and titillation is more than adequately provided in popular entertainment and what fascinates the students in this text is rather that it deals with contemporary life. It is not the ‘rude bits’ they find interesting, but they want to discuss such things as victimisation and the place of violence in society. They focus on relationships in the stories and draw moral conclusions on who was right and who was wrong. The realism of the text provokes this in a way not many books do. The situations can be taken seriously because they are not a sanitised version of life. We should give students credit for being able to make their own moral judgements, to look at social realities and to reflect on their moral and political significance.</p>

<p>Burra Burra DC advises that reports indicate the Kingston Street Bridge that dates from c. 1878 has reduced flexibility because of design standards when built and the installation of concrete decking in 1933. Overweight vehicles would not cause it to crack, but to collapse. Consequently it has a load limit of 8 tonnes gross. Strengthening is not an option because the superstructure would have to be removed.</p>

<p>The upgrading of the Casualty &amp; Theatre areas has been helped by the bequest from the estate of the late Miss Agnes Seigert.</p>

The other half toured Burra sites. [In view of the Burra Burra DC report Issue 179, 21 September 1994, page 2 below the ‘charcoal pits’ would seem to refer to the slag paddock.]</p>

<p>Burra Housing Development</p>
<p>The Kooringa CoHousing Co-operative plans to build 23 homes and a community centre on five acres of vacant land an Allen Street on the southern edge of Burra. The density will be c. 4 per acre, but instead of each being on a quarter acre block, they will cluster around a central building that will provide a community kitchen, laundry, lounge and playroom, leaving the rest of the site available for orchards, windbreaks, gardens and play space. This style of development has become popular in Scandinavia and the USA, but is the first of its kind in SA. It is funded mainly by the SA Government. The design includes solar heating. Co-op members do not own the houses, but have a lifetime security of tenure. The secretary of the Kooringa CoHousing is Colin Endean. Tree planting has begun on the site and funding for the first seven houses has been approved by the SA Co-operative Housing Authority.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>Acting Hospital Board Chairperson Colleen Woodgate said a Service agreement between the Hospital and the Health Commission , due to be signed on 14 October, has not been signed and many letters seeking clarification have not been answered. The Hospital is seeking clarification on the allocated bed numbers and the ratio of private and public bed numbers.</p>
<p>The 1990 agreement allocated the 30 beds as 10 acute and 20 long stay nursing home type. At present there are 17 long stays in residence.</p>
<p>Funding has been allocated for 9 long stays and the resulting shortfall in funds would make running the Hospital quite difficult. Advice on Friday was that sections of the agreement were being redrafted. Mr Kerin MP has been advised that nursing home bed days have been marginally reduced as more nursing homes were being built. Burra’s doubling of long term patients in recent months has gone against this trend.</p>
<p>Ram Sales</p>

<p>Remnant Vegetation in the Burra Hills region will be the subject of a survey 23-30 October. The survey will cover remnant vegetation on private bushland outside national parks. This information is needed in determining which plant species are best suited for revegetation work and will be useful to Landcare and Greening Australia and will also aid in assessing fire hazards and fuel loads for bushfire management. Owners of land will receive a letter seeking permission for survey teams (a botanist and assistant) to enter land to collect data. The area to be surveyed ranges from Saddleworth to Booborowie in the east, the plains in the west, Eudunda in the south and Peterborough in the north. [East &amp; west would seem to be the wrong way round.]</p>

<p>AdChem</p>
<p>There is presently a glut of copper oxide on the world market and as a result the Burra operation will shed about eight jobs. The board has asked for charges to effect a saving of $1 million. The idea is to ensure the long term viability of the Burra plant. Cuts will affect both award based and staff positions. Production for the year will be around 15% below the previous year’s output. Since the suspension of concentrate treatment the company’s priority has been to obtain a lower cost source of raw materials. This has proved difficult and so other costs must be cut. From next month the operation of the cupric oxide plant will return to a 19 day shift cycle, reducing the shift teams from four to three. One person will also be cut from each shift team. A further cut of one person from the day shift relief team and from maintenance will also be needed.</p>

<p>Redbanks Reserve</p>
<p>Redbanks has been a popular community recreation area for many years. After it became popular with motorbike riders and off road recreation vehicle users, a number of accidents led to the Government closing it in December 1992. It was then declared a Conservation, Recreation and Education Reserve under the control of the Burra Burra DC on 26 November 1993. The reserve was closed to the public pending a draft plan. Off road recreational vehicles will not be allowed back. The draft plan suggests:</p>
<p>The removal of feral animals</p>
<p>The prohibition of dogs and cats on the reserve</p>
<p>That horses be restricted to defined areas on a trial basis</p>
<p>The continuation of the ban on off road vehicles</p>
<p>The plan also addresses maintenance, visitor access and future management. The draft is available at the Council Office and public comment is invited.</p>

<p>Maureen Bevan was accorded a Civic Function on 8 December to honour her contribution and commitment to the management of Paxton Square Cottages over the past decade. She and her late husband Bryan, were appointed as managers soon after the Bridge Terrace row was restored in 1983. They saw the complete square restored and made available for holiday accommodation.</p>
<p>Andrew Gebhardt, who was a former Chairman of the Lewis Board, commended Maureen and Bryan for their work. When work started it was thought a 40% occupancy rate was needed to service the loan. A staggering 80% rate was achieved and that paved the way to proceed with restoration.</p>
<p>Robyn Page, immediate past Chairman of the Lewis Board, endorsed Andrew’s remarks and described the Bevans as hard working, caring and kind and they achieved a State Tourism Award, which gave Paxton Square national exposure. Maureen had continued alone after the death of her husband – with the help of her family.</p>

<p>Rick Williams, works manager for Burra National Trust, was digging a post hole at the Bon accord Mine site when the shovel disappeared down the hole. He discovered some stone foundations and a twenty foot deep shaft, which was partly undermining a section of Linkson Street. It will be further investigated, but is thought to be Dickson’s Shaft. A number of shafts are believed to exist on the site, though none of them bore copper ore.</p>

<p>Weather. Burra’s rainfall for 1994 totalled 271 mm, which was well short of the average of 450 mm.</p>
<p>Issue 194, 18 January 1995, page 1</p>

<p>Letter. Dick Cleland write re the refurbishment of the Mt Bryan East School. He is glad to have taken before and after photos – though wishes that the render had been preserved, rather than removed.</p>
<p>[The context seems to imply that the render should have been preserved as an original feature of the building. In fact the school was not originally rendered and presumably the render was added when the school was repaired at some point. Its removal and repointing of the stone work would thus have been restoring the original nature of the exterior.]</p>

<p>Hallett Primary School Council has written a strongly worded letter to Rob Lucas, Minister of Education &amp; Children’s Services, outlining the ‘lack of understanding and support shown by the Department and Members of Parliament’ during recent events surrounding the removal of the school bus service. At the time the bus was one child short of the number required for retention and a simple rerouting would have given sufficient numbers to keep it going – the family in question was incorrectly located on Departmental maps, making them seem closer to the Burra Secondary School bus. Now parents are being encouraged to remove children from Hallett because Burra’s secondary School buses are being made available to pick up Primary students.</p>
<p>[The article goes on to mention dissatisfaction with the headmaster and with the District Superintendent and the process of selecting a new headmaster. The Council feared the school was being undermined so that it could be closed, despite reassurances that this was not so.]</p>

<p>Letter. Lionel M. Young L.Th., JP of Mowll Village, Castle Hill, NSW writes with some reminiscences.</p>
<p>He was presently 92 and his father was Joseph Hawkins Checcuci Young, born in Burra 27 November 1868 and his mother was Alice Ada Clode born 16 November 1869. He was related to the Woollacott family and a cousin of Stan Woollacott. He visited Burra in 1932, staying with his Aunt Kate, nee Woollacott and also with Aunt Essie, who lived opposite the railway station. His parents had moved to Tyabb in Victoria, where he was born 6 May 1903. He had a sister Evelyn born 6 May 1901 and a brother Keith born 24 May 1905.</p>
<p>They left Tyabb when he was aged 3 and of the 8 siblings three survive. He met Josie Battye last year at a church Friendship Luncheon. He recalls that one of the Woollacott boys opened a college in Essendon, Victoria and another who was a Methodist minister in 1928 over there.</p>

<p>Burra Yacht Club Regatta</p>
<p>There were some 500 spectators and eight teams in the dragon boat event, which was won by the Boarding House students. The morning parade of entries included some very large stilted puppets from WomAdelaide’s the ‘Ringless Circus’. Flour bombs from the bridge played a part in the outcome of races. The Nourse bath-boat, complete with shower, was high in the style stakes, but with the heavier Nourse-Brak combination in the bath promptly sank upon their boarding. The last regatta was held in 1988. The idea began in 1985 when Jimmy James, in attempting to cross the flooded creek at the Bon Accord Hotel, lost his car to the floodwaters. Peter Reilly bravely mounted a rescue mission – some say against immense odds – and pulled off a famous rescue. This encouraged locals to immortalise his actions in the annals of local history, leading to the Burra Yacht Club and the boat races. [3 photos.]</p>

<p>Kangaroo Blindness Epidemic</p>
<p>A widespread epidemic of blindness affecting kangaroos has been reported across the Riverland and Flinders Ranges districts and it has now appeared to the east of Burra. The cause is presently unknown, though a virus is suspected. There is no treatment. It has been seen most in western grey kangaroos, but more recently has appeared in red kangaroos. Police and Wild Life Officers ask for any sightings to be reported with details if possible of the breed, sex, size and location. The disease was first noticed in SA near Renmark some weeks ago.</p>

<p>Letter. Des Woolley writes at some length, suggesting that the long list of candidates for Council suggests a general dissatisfaction with that body and he also suggests:</p>
<p>There are too many restrictions and rules (laid down by an absentee body)</p>
<p>Too much Council money is expended on so-called expert advisors and consultants</p>
<p>Too many take-away food shops, antique shops and Bed &amp; Breakfast places in Burra, but nowhere locally to buy clothes and shoes</p>
<p>Council is failing to address the basic problems of the area</p>
<p>So vote and vote thoughtfully with the above in mind.</p>

<p>Letter. Anthony Thorogood writes about gardening without water. In planting some 6,000 shrubs and trees on his property in the past four years, he watered each once with about 10 litres of water and 75% have lived. He claims the other 25% were killed by frost. The answer is to plant trees and shrubs that suit the local soil conditions and require only the expected amount of rainfall – in this area 350-450 mm. 450 mm will support red flowering blue gums, coral gums, wattles, white flowering tea trees, hakeas and purple and white hardenbergias and many more.</p>

<p>An Autobiographical sketch by William Trembath is printed.</p>
<p>I was born at Kooringa, county Burra on 13 May 1851. When very Young was sent to a private school run by Mr O&hellip;d – thoroughly educated himself, but lacking the essential skills for becoming an efficient teacher. Dissatisfied with my progress, my parents then transferred me to the tuition of Mr Sk&hellip;s, where I obtained the greatest portion of my education. Here discipline was harsh and I often went home with smarting hands or sore shoulders from the strap. They said it was for being pert and forward, naughty and insolent and was therefore just. (I doubt it.) At 12 years of age I went to Mr W&hellip;s Commercial Academy, where I was successful and gained praise for general proficiency. Mr W. was a person of thoroughly classical attainments and had a most efficient mode of teaching. In early life I had an almost unconquerable love of horses and was never happier than when on horseback, riding recklessly and assisting in mustering horses or cattle or on a day’s kangaroo hunt. I frequently visited the North Eastern Plains, the Murray, Kitchowla [Ketchowla] and Baldino [Baldina] all picturesque and lovely spots and happy days around a campfire with merry songs and romantic tales.</p>
<p>[The school teachers suggested here would seem to be:</p>
<p>Thomas and Mary Oakford who had a school in the old Bible Christian Chapel in Market Square 1853-65.</p>
<p>W&hellip;s would refer to Mr &amp; Mrs F.R. White’s school established in 1863.</p>
<p>Sk&hellip;s has not been identified, but could be a mistaken transcription for John Stephens (St&hellip;s) who ran the Wesleyan Day School 1857-72.]</p>

They outlined the parameters that had been agreed to in 1993 and pointed out that a solution for the excess numbers was to enter a C grade team at Spalding, but no response had been received to this proposal. Forming a committee this year had proved difficult and it had taken two attempts to hold an AGM, just to meet quorum requirements.</p>

<p>Redbanks Reserve</p>
<p>Last week a major operation was mounted to remove car bodies from the reserve. Approximately 400 car bodies were recovered from the ravine on the north side of the park. Most had been dumped in the 1960s and 1970s. They were recovered by a crane from Clare Valley Waste Service. A significant amount of associated rubbish remains. Simsmetal has used a mobile crusher to reduce the bodies into flat lumps of metal. By Friday two semi-trailers were en route to Adelaide with scrap metal, the sale of which will pay for the operation. Redbanks still bears the scars of abuse from motorcyclists. Consultants are preparing a management plan and this should be completed by September.</p>
<p>It is expected the reserve will be closed for some time, but will eventually be opened again so that people will be able to enjoy its permanent water holes, red cliffs and fine stands of mallee and sites of archaeological significance. It was declared a reserve on 26 November 1993. Some limited use of the reserve is expected to be permitted soon.</p>

<p>Griffith’s Cottage, Bed &amp; Breakfast</p>
<p>In 1912 John Griffiths built a shop/residence at 8 Morehead Street, Aberdeen and his wife operated a successful business there for approximately 30 years.* At the rear of the property a stone building was constructed and used as a storeroom. Over the years it has had many uses and when Richard Holbrook &amp; Jenny Field purchased the property, it was a dilapidated granny flat. They have now had it converted to a two-bedroom Bed &amp; Breakfast. Stephen Angel helped with design and furnishings. David Parnell replaced an exterior stud wall with stone and in conjunction with Chris Kelly restored the stonework. Simon O’Connor of Tunglebung Pioneer Furniture made a lampstand, table, curtain rods and bush gates. Peter Strawbridge, blacksmith, made door latches, etc. Alan Hall of Burra Furniture Works made other furniture and other local tradesmen, Malcolm Beinke, David Loffler, David Nourse and Adam Green contributed their skills.</p>
<p>[Advertisement and advertorial.]</p>
<p>[*This is not strictly true. The shop was run by his wife and two of his unmarried daughters. John Griffiths was older than his wife by some 27 years and by the 1930s the couple had retired to Glenelg, leaving the running of the shop to two daughters. One of them married in 1934 and the shop was then taken over by a third daughter, Katie and her husband, Hilary Fuss. Katie Fuss died in 1936. Hilary carried on the business until 1941.]</p>

<p>National Trust Display at BankSA</p>
<p>The display runs from 18-31 May and the Kooringa [Masonic] Lodge invites the public to the Town Hall on 27 May for a Public Introduction to Freemasonry.</p>
<p>Freemasonry began in Burra soon after the discovery of copper. Power to hold a Lodge in Burra was granted under the Constitution of the Grand Lodge of England, with the Lodge to be known as the Mildred Lodge No. 585. [The first regular meeting was held on 16 February 1850.] The name was changed to Kooringa Lodge in 1854. For many years the meetings were held in the Assembly Room of the Burra Hotel [i.e. the hotel on the site of the Burra Hospital] with meetings timed to be held immediately before full moon to facilitate the safe journey of members afterwards. After the mine closed in 1877 many families left and [in December 1888] the Charter was surrendered. A new Charter was granted under the name of Kooringa Lodge No. 6 [in August 1899]. The Lodge purchased the [former Primitive Methodist Church] for £350 [in 1901] and the refurbished building was dedicated on 18 June 1901. The Lodge celebrated its centenary in 1950. There have been 407 members since 1850.</p>
<p>The Oddfellows MUIOOF</p>
<p>The Loyal Burra Burra Lodge was established in March 1849 with eight members. In 1933 the Lodge Hall was built at Burra North and in 1945 it had 363 members and funds of £12,000. It also had a Junior Lodge with 110 members and funds of £440. [Note the story of the Oddfellows Lodge in Burra is much more complicated than this suggests. There were two separate Lodges for many years – one that met in Kooringa and an Aberdeen Lodge that met until 1910 in the Lutheran Church in Redruth.]</p>
<p>Independent Order of Rechabites, Rose of Sharon Tent.</p>
<p>This was founded in Burra 29 September 1865. Meetings were first held in the old Baptist Church [in Thames Street], but moved after a few years to the Lodge Room at the Burra Town Hall. In 1876 Brother C.J. Pearce was elected secretary, a position he held for a period of 63 years.</p>
<p>The Foresters Lodge</p>
<p>This was established in Burra in 1859 and by 1945 there were 101 adult members and funds of £2,500. A Juvenile Lodge was founded in 1891.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Lodge</p>
<p>This lodge was a latecomer, being founded in Burra only on 24 April 1937 with Mr Frank Baulderstone as foundation secretary. [For many years it met in the former Scout Hall on Market Street, just south of St Just Street at Burra North]</p>

<p>The Old Mt Bryan East School was the venue to officially open the Heysen Trail Huts last Saturday. The huts provide accommodation for hikers on the Heysen and Mawson Trails and have been developed over the past seven years by the Outdoors Recreation Unit of the Office for Recreation, Sport and Racing. They were opened by the Minister of Health and Aboriginal Affairs, Dr Michael Armitage. So far ten huts have been established and eventually seventy-five will be placed a day’s walk apart along the trails. Each has basic cooking and sleeping facilities and rain water tanks. The first hut was Mayo Hut in the Flinders Ranges – officially opened in September 1988 – a former pioneer settler’s cottage.</p>
<p>[The article then goes on to give details of funding and which groups have done the work.]</p>
<p>The Mt Bryan East School was built in 1884, opened in 1885 and closed in 1947. It was vacant until acquired by the National Trust in the early 1970s, but unfortunately the Trust lacked the funds to restore it and so it was transferred to the Department of Recreation &amp; Sport in 1990.

<p>Letter. Ian Auhl writes saying that the Governor General was apparently non-plussed to hear that two of the S.T. Gill paintings were recovered from the town dump.</p>
<p>‘It certainly surprised me.’</p>
<p>Auhl then outlines the real sequence of events:</p>
<p>He found the paintings under the Burra Town Hall stage in 1966.</p>
<p>He took the four paintings to Adelaide to the Art Gallery of SA with the full knowledge and permission of the then Mayor, Mr E. Baulderstone.</p>
<p>This was necessary because three of them had been gathering mould under the stage and all four needed to spend time in the Art Gallery fumigator and have fungicide treatment.</p>
<p>They also needed to be authenticated by art specialists.</p>
<p>He had been shown the wooden access panel to the under-stage area by Burra Institute Librarian Mrs Steer and was actually looking for missing bound copies of the Register newspaper from the 1850s, when the discarded paintings had been found.</p>
<p>The discovery and the other S.T. Gill paintings in the Art Gallery of SA had motivated him to write the book Australia’s Earliest Mining Era – South Australia 1841-51, Paintings of S.T. Gill.</p>

<p>Burra Cemetery. The ‘Chinese’ and the ‘Murder’ headstones have been repaired. The Chinese headstone was in small pieces and had to be assembled like a jigsaw puzzle and the Murder headstone needed some lettering re-chipped. Pearse Monumental Masons of Clare did the work. Some headstones have been replaced [from those along the wall] and where positions were not known (because some records have been lost) they have been placed in the area cleared in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Kooringa Masonic Lodge has assisted in repositioning a stone which had been erected by them in 1878. Headstones in the cemetery testify to the many different countries from which early resident came.</p>

<p>The Parsons’ Exhibition – Critique by Glenys Christopher</p>
<p>The panorama of the Burra Hills commissioned by the Council to celebrate Burra’s J150 is in the unique style of Allyson Parsons and is a beautiful acquisition by and for the people of the district.</p>
<p>‘Detail of grasses, shrubs, rocks and building materials, the foreground in shadow and the distant hills lit by a soft and glowing light make this work a superb celebration of the artist’s love of this country and of Burra’s 150 years. Realism, detail and subtle colour are obvious attributes of Allyson’s work, but her portrayal of light makes her paintings breathtaking.’</p>
<p>Marie’s drawings are exquisite. Sunlight reflects off enamel jugs and teapots, dazzles on the skins of pomegranate and lights background hills. The whole exhibition is a credit to these two artists and the venue is superb.</p>

<p>Burra Telecentre</p>
<p>A small working party is considering the possibility of establishing a telecentre in Burra that could provide a whole range of services to farmers, rural industries and small businesses. The idea has been pioneered in a number of rural centres across Australia, though only one is operational in SA and that is on Eyre Peninsula. It could provide the use of word processing programs, spreadsheets, farm management programs and other computer software with tutors available to teach their use. It cloud extend existing educational services, for example in conjunction with TAFE. Through the internet it could start to promote Burra internationally as the Merino Capital of the world and promote Burra’s heritage and tourist attractions. It is possible that Federal funds may become available to help with the cost of financing such a centre.</p>

<p>A model of Kooringa’s proposed ecologically designed houses will be on display at the Civic Centre this Saturday 5 August. Ian Millington of Kooringa CoHousing Co-op said this development is planned for five acres on Allen Street on the southern fringe of Burra.</p>
<p>Application for approval will go to Council within five weeks. The proposal will put four houses on one acre, but instead of one per quarter acre block, they will cluster round a safe and pleasant central place with cars confined to the edge. Each house is private and fully equipped except for a laundry. A central building will provide a community dining room, laundry, office, library and playroom. The idea is popular in Scandinavia, parts of Europe and USA. The houses are to be ecologically designed and though members cannot own a house, they can invest in equity and have a lifetime security of tenure.</p>

<p>Anthony Thorogood – ‘The Rainforests of Burra’</p>
<p>An article on the question of whether Burra was ever forested.</p>
<p>Claims are made for the presence of river red gums, blue gums, peppermint gums and sheoaks in the area. There is good evidence for red gums along the local creeks. Old records make reference to sheoaks and Kooringa is said to mean a ‘place of sheoaks’ in the Ngadjuri language. Records do not refer to blue gums in Burra, but there are good stands of blue gums to the south, north and west. I have been told there are peppermint gums on Princess Royal Station.</p>
<p>S.T. Gill’s painting of a View of Burra in 1847 shows sheoaks and strands [sic] of gums.</p>
<p>Golden wattle is colonising part of the mine site and the district also has examples of the rare Acacia glandulicarpa and of Acacia rotundifolia on road verges. Another native shrub is the Christmas bush, Bursaria spinosa.</p>
<p>Despite this all the old writings and paintings support the view that the area was dominated by savannah woodland – that is to say a grassland with scattered trees. The recent discovery of the pygmy blue tongue lizard supports this, as it is a creature of grassland.</p>

<p>Anthony Thorogood – ‘The Rainforests of Burra’</p>
<p>A continuation of the article from the previous issue.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t Burra well wooded when the white settlers arrived?</p>
<p>I believe that the soil was good, rainfall adequate and despite cold winters, it was not by world standards very cold.</p>
<p>I believe the answer lies in the firestick farming practice of the Aborigines.</p>
<p>Fire encouraged fresh grass, which in turn encouraged kangaroos. Early explorers like Flinders constantly mentioned fires. Repeated fires, along with kangaroos, frost and drought killed tree saplings.</p>
<p>A rich black vein of rock on our property was tested and declared to be carbon – perhaps representing a long dead rain forest that died before the Aborigines came.</p>
<p>Sheoaks may have been quite thick when Aborigines first came and were thinned by fire. Remaining trees were exterminated by settlers with sheep, miners with goats and pigs and a demand for structural timber and firewood. I believe in planting trees, but not in the native grassland areas, which are a unique stockhouse of wild grasses and flowers with their own unique wildlife.</p>

<p>Fire</p>
<p>The White Hart Garage, operated by the Thamm families at Burra North, was gutted by fire in the early hours of Friday morning last. The fire appears to have started in the office area and spread along the roofline to the rear of the building. MFS, CFS &amp; SES crews attended and controlled the blaze within an hour. The main damage was to the office and spare parts sections. Some irreplaceable records of the firm’s history as wheelwrights have been lost. Several vehicles were caught in the fire – a truck and Landcruiser were burnt and a tractor and Landrover suffered lesser damage. Damage has been estimated at c. $250,000 and the clean-up is expected to take some weeks. The fire was contained to the original section of the garage and fire investigators believe an electrical fault was the cause. [Photo of Travis Thamm in the burnt-out office.]</p>

Despite their name they have a pink tongue, which distinguishes them from their larger brethren. [Photo.]</p>

<p>SA Government wishes to halve the number of Councils. They have said they wish to reduce the number to 59 rather than by one third or to 34 as recommended in the MAG Report. Councils will be given three months after the appointment of the Board to propose voluntary amalgamations. The Local Government Board will facilitate assistance so that formalities can be completed in time for the 1997 Council elections.</p>
<p>Councils who do not nominate a proposed amalgamation will be assessed and the Board would then make recommendations on amalgamating to improve efficiency. A ratepayers’ poll would then follow. The proposals are different from the recommendations of the Ministerial Advisory Group, which reported last month.</p>
<p>Burra Council has stated they are not in favour of forced amalgamations.</p>

<p>Council Tourism Policy</p>
<p>A public meeting at Burra Courthouse on Monday night called on the Council’s Resource Committee to produce a comprehensive business plan for the main individual tourist sites. It has been asked that the plans show short term break-even points and eventual financial and community benefits. About 150 people attended and local tradesman Alan Hall laid down the rules that allowed Council members, Chairman Graham Kellock, Tourism Resource Committee Chairperson Colleen Woodgate and Finance Chairman Jim Quinn opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>The tourism budget for this year came under close scrutiny. Colleen Woodgate said the Council was working with the National Trust and Burra Traders Association to establish a Tourism Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Len Bence said he thought Paxton’s Cottages were well run before the Council took over.</p>
<p>Councillor Quinn said the main hurdle before leasing the Caravan Park and Paxton Square Cottages was the outstanding loans on those sites.</p>
<p>Dick Cleland said as a Bed &amp; Breakfast operator he felt uncomfortable with the Tourist Office acting as a booking agent and promoter of both Council run enterprises and private operators.</p>
<p>Chris Reed pointed out that tourism was estimated some years ago to bring more than $4 million annually into the district.</p>
<p>Andrew Gebhardt said tourism attracted significant federal and state grants – the main problem lay in ongoing staffing costs.</p>
<p>Councillors were pushed on the question:</p>
<p>‘Where do you stop subsidising tourist ventures running at a loss?’</p>

<p>Saltbush Prime</p>
<p>Clare chef Stephen Schmitz is supplying saltbush hogget carcases for $7.70 kg to top restaurants and hotels around Australia and overseas, it was revealed at a ‘saltbush hogget’ meeting in Burra last week.</p>
<p>He urged graziers and industry representatives to think seriously about organising the marketing of a new product to be called ‘Saltbush Prime’.</p>
<p>This is needed to control substitution rackets, regulate prices and develop bulk markets. The product can be promoted as lean, clean and green – without chemicals.</p>
<p>It would use merinos 18-24 months with a dress weight of 23-25 kg. Hanging on the bone (cryovac storage) for up to six weeks improves the flavour. It should be treated as a game meat:</p>
<p>Hot searing followed by a long rest period</p>
<p>Or if slow cooked, in an open dish.</p>
<p>Ian Warnes of Woolgangi is supplying 25 animals per week to WildOz Pty Ltd for a fixed $40 per head. Although time consuming, it was worthwhile because of the reliability of the sales. Woolgangi runs 8,000 to 10,000 merinos, producing 2,500 to 3,000 lambs. Hoggets from outside country are suitable for 8-10 months of the year, but in the dry period after Christmas the idea is to supplement from animals off saltbush plantations in the inside country.</p>

<p>Creek Day</p>
<p>The festivities by the Burra Creek on Saturday were very successful. A large crowd spread along the park from 10 a.m. and the official launch was made by Barry Wakelin MP – the local federal member. There were plenty of arts and crafts stalls, food stalls and music. There was a fairground organ, Jeanette Wormald with her SA country music, the Celtic Broadsword Team and the Royal Caledonian Society Pipers. Dick Frankel and the Jazz Disciples and The Wild Matildas were also there, as were the folk combo, Brigalow and the Morrismen. Matt Reilly refereed the ice cream eating competition.</p>

<p>The show went very well, with a record attendance. Gate takings were a record – up about 30% on recent years. Entries in the horse sections were at record levels, though cooking, produce and children’s sections were down somewhat. Shearing returned after being absent for some years and the trade stands were well represented.</p>

Council Chairman, Graham Kellock, said the Council wanted to know where it could help in tourism development. One problem raised was that the present passport was linked in only with Council and National Trust properties. The idea of an independent body running the Tourism Office was mooted.</p>

<p>Back to Burra Schools Reunion</p>
<p>Despite atrocious weather that included a few snowflakes, about 700 people registered for the reunion on 21 &amp; 22 October. This included 35 from interstate and 40 former staff members. All events had to be held indoors due to the very wet and wintry weather. Information given allowed at least 40 schools to be identified. A booklet titled ‘School Daze’ was printed and each senior citizen was given a copy. Dinners on Saturday night were held at the Sports Complex and the Burra Hotel and each was booked out.</p>
<p>Sunday’s assembly was moved to the school gymnasium, where former headmaster Colin Morrison conducted the assembly. A salute to the flag was followed by much reminiscing. Addresses were given by:</p>
<p>Ray Jennison – dux of the school in 1942</p>
<p>Kevin Fahey – Present Principal</p>
<p>Graham Kellock – Chairman of the Burra Burra DC</p>
<p>Robyn Page – Chair of the Burra Jubilee 150 Committee</p>
<p>The Burra Community Library had a display of school memorabilia.</p>
<p>A bus tour in the afternoon visited the sites of St Joseph’s School and those at Copperhouse, Ayers, Leighton, Gum Creek, Wheetelande and others.</p>
<p>At Ayers a former teacher, Mr George Murray (almost 90) spoke to the group and a cairn of stones had been built by Don Lloyd in readiness for a plaque.</p>
<p>All in all it was a very successful reunion despite the weather.</p>
<p>Issue 234, 25 October 1995, page 2</p>
<p>The Races at Kimberly Station had to be cancelled due to the wet conditions, but two teenage girls ignored the advice and drove their Gemini sedan on roads unfit for a 4WD and were finally bogged 15 km east of Pine Valley Station. They were found at 1.30 p.m. the following day. 40 Burra residents who had gone out earlier were stranded at Kimberly until road conditions improved. Strangely, although the food delivery had been impeded by the road conditions, the alcohol supply seems to have made it through.</p>

<p>Letter. A long letter from Robyn Page repeats much of the school reunion news, but a note lists the nine school sites that the Burra J150 committee had had plaques made for:</p>

<p>Letter. Ian Auhl writes concerning an invitation for Professor Blainey to speak at Burra on 9 December. He says he has been aware of Blainey’s importance to Burra since reading his book The Rush That Never Ended in 1964 – which first impressed upon him that Kapunda and Burra were Australia’s first mining towns. Blainey’s first contribution was to substantiate Auhl’s submission to the SA Government to have the whole of Paxton Square placed under the protection of the Historic Relics Act (1965). Blainey also gave Auhl permission to use his words ‘Australia’s Earliest Mining Era’ as the title for one of Auhl’s books in 1970. Auhl doubts if his research and submissions concerning the various historic sites would have proceeded without Blainey’s inspiration. Without Blainey’s insight, it is likely Burra would have remained a sleepy old town, almost unaware of its significance to SA history and it is doubtful if it would have become a Proclaimed Historic Town.</p>

<p>Issue 237, 15 November 1995, page 3</p>
<p>The Editor (Terry Wilson) writes on the need for Burra to have an industrial zone, which has been a matter of some discussion for quite a while. Three factors limit possibilities in Burra:</p>
<p>Zoning regulations</p>
<p>Perceived heritage conflict</p>
<p>Nearness to a watercourse</p>
<p>Enquiries from the Broadcaster over two years have elicited no replies except prevarication. A firm industrial base would help boost the town’s dwindling business activity and help the ancillary services and shopping facilities to thrive. Other towns in other areas with similar problems have tackled the difficulties and done things such as offering sites and services or free rate periods of up to five years.</p>
<p>A project with only twenty extra incomes would have a positive effect and look what happened to real estate values when Adchem shed fifty workers. As a result families left, school numbers fell and there was a glut of empty houses.</p>
<p>If the decline of the town as a service centre is not seen as a dangerous option, decisions will drift on as they have been for two years.</p>

<p>Ratepayers’ Association</p>
<p>A meeting of more than 50 concerned citizens last Tuesday resulted in the formation of a Ratepayers’ Association in the Burra Council District.</p>
<p>Mr Alan Hall said a major reason for its formation was the lack of response from the Council after the last public meeting at the Old Courthouse. This had called for Council to furnish a business plan for their different areas of activity. He was also critical of the Broadcaster for what he said was highly selective reporting of Council minutes.</p>
<p>A committee of 13 was elected with Alan Hall as Chairman and John Monfries as Secretary-Treasurer.</p>

This coincides with the considerable local debate over the Council’s role in the tourism industry. There is a widespread belief that the Council should be doing more to attract new and essential business to Burra and relaxing some of its rules and regulations arising from heritage legislation. The Traders’ Association has fewer members than in the past and has decided its role needs re-defining. This is especially so in view of Council amalgamation prospects, with a possible base elsewhere.</p>
<p>People are especially concerned over the rapid turnover in shops, the absence of some essential services, which leads people to shop elsewhere and the large number of houses for sale.</p>
<p>While there was concern over high rates, there was no widespread disagreement with Council policies on tourism. Most people surveyed saw Burra’s future closely tied in with tourism and with heritage values. They were concerned with the perceived lack of communication between Council and the community. Customer service in Burra was said to have improved and prices were now broadly comparable with Clare. Most people associated the Traders’ Association with the Christmas celebrations, but with little else – though a need for an association to present traders with a united voice to talk with Council was accepted.</p>
<p>A suggestion was to re-name the Burra Business Association in an attempt to widen its base to represent tourism operators and other businesses. The survey also suggested it should:</p>
<p>Encourage people to shop locally</p>
<p>Undertake joint promotional activities</p>
<p>Worth with the Main Street Committee to provide a general facelift in the town centre</p>
<p>Help attract new businesses</p>
<p>Work with the school to promote local employment.</p>
<p>The Council was keen to work closely with the Association. Several people stressed that the Association should not be waiting for the Council to take the initiative. The town needed an Association to draw people together and in this context the recently formed Ratepayers’ Association was seen as retrograde – being more divisive than helpful.</p>

<p>Letter. Ian Auhl writes, pointing out that the J150 year has seen an emphasis in Burra on history, heritage and tourism. There will naturally be a reaction in the coming year and a need for a balance between heritage, tourism and Burra’s role as a service centre. He suggests part of the answer is as it has always been – loyalty to the town and its institutions with local shopping and the use of local services.</p>

<p>The Smelts Paddock</p>
<p>This article deals with the new trail and signage around the site and lists some of the points:</p>
<p>The Patent Copper Co. was formed in London in early 1848 to build and operate a smelting works at the Burra Burra Mine.</p>
<p>By mid-1849 the first smelting house was completed with eight furnaces and a refinery, with three furnaces added in 1850.</p>
<p>The English &amp; Australian Copper Co. took over in 1851.</p>
<p>A second smelting house with nine furnaces commenced operations in 1854.</p>
<p>As payment the smelting company retained one third of the copper produced.</p>
<p>The operations were conducted by Welsh smeltermen, brought out from Swansea with their families 1849-55.</p>
<p>Houses for up to 75 smeltermen were provided at the works.</p>
<p>The village of Llwchwr was established about 1 km to the north in 1855.</p>
<p>The smelting works employed 1,000, including 400 teamsters in 1851.</p>
<p>At first refined copper was carted by bullock dray to Pt Wakefield.</p>
<p>After 1857 it was carted by mule teams to the Kapunda railhead.</p>
<p>Production declined after 1862, when smelting works were erected at Pt Adelaide and operations at Burra ceased in 1869.</p>
<p>In all some 28,000 tons of copper metal were produced from 150,000 tons of Burra ore – at today’s prices for copper this was worth some $100 million.</p>
<p>When mining began at Burra in 1845 Swansea in Wales was the world’s principal copper smelting centre.</p>
<p>The site at Burra is of world significance as possibly the only example where remains of a pre-1860 Welsh-style smelting works survive.</p>
<p>The site was listed on the State heritage Register in 1984.</p>

<p>The J150 Commemorative Dinner</p>
<p>Professor Geoffrey Blainey was the keynote speaker at the J150 dinner at the Burra Town Hall. He was welcomed by Robyn Page, Chair of the J150 Committee. Professor Blainey paid tribute to those responsible for preserving the history of Burra, specifically to Ian Auhl. He painted a picture of Australia on the eve of the Victorian gold rush, when Burra was the seventh largest town in Australia and the only one in the top ten not to be a port. It was then twice the size of Brisbane, with a population of 5,000. It had the first health benefits scheme in Australia and provided housing for miners. It was also the largest Cornish community outside of England. The first Bible Christian Church in Australia was built here in 1850. (Now the Paxton Square Cottages booking office.) He also placed Burra in later exploration. In 1873 Gosse named Ayers Rock after the Secretary of Burra’s mining company, Sir Henry Ayers. John Forrest, after an epic travel through Western Australia, was treated to a dinner at the relatively new Burra Town Hall. Ernest Giles also was given a dinner in his return to the outskirts of civilisation. Professor Blainey also mentioned the Lewis family and placed Burra in the wider plane of Australia’s history.

<p>Letter. ‘Ulrike’ writes commending kangaroo meat as part of a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Letter. John Oates writes in response to Alan Hall’s alleged comment that the Council had an ‘arrogant and born-to-rule’ attitude.</p>
<p>It seems pointless to elect a ratepayers’ association to belt the Council that has just been elected.</p>
<p>Council would appear weak or foolish if it went to the ratepayers’ association to make a decision.</p>
<p>How can Councillors be unapproachable if they have not been approached?</p>
<p>Since May I have had four people outside of Council contact me over issues.</p>
<p>Ratepayers’ Association says it has c. 60 members – this number would not have elected a Councillor in May 1995.</p>
<p>As a ratepayer, I have concerns over the tourism industry in Burra. Some small or one large industrial development would bring probably as much or more growth, jobs and money as tourism at present.</p>
<p>Council is propping up tourism because it is saving the town from dying, until some industry is brought here. I can’t see we have much choice.</p>
<p>Sure, many things cannot be bought in Burra, but if people who shopped for everything outside of the town started shopping here, perhaps Council would not have to spend so much of electors’ money on tourism.</p>
<p>I too would like to see money spent on roads and see rates fixed for a few years.</p>
<p>Every time there is an election the few who do most complaining don’t have the courage to stand for election – using the same old excuse of lack of time.</p>
<p>The last thing we need is division in the town.</p>

<p>Stuart Plaque Unveiled</p>
<p>A plaque was unveiled in front of the Burra Art Gallery on Saturday morning to commemorate the return of the successful John McDouall Stuart expedition in 1861. Local resident of 36 years, Beth Field and her sister Pat Farquhar with husband Norman (who came from Victoria) were present. [Photo.]</p>
<p>The sisters were born in Gawler, not far from the house at Kingsford where the explorer Stephen King lived. He was their grandmother’s brother and had taken part in the 1861 Stuart expedition, crossing the continent from south to north and back. As a result of his involvement he also became involved in a survey for the erection of the overland telegraph from Adelaide to Darwin.</p>
<p>Judge Wilson, Chairman of the Gallery’s Board, is also related to Stephen King. He referred to the connection in his speech. The Mortlock Library had agreed to the display of four original sketches by Stephen King as part of a small exhibition of pictures and memorabilia associated with the expedition. About 50 members of the John McDouall Stuart Society attended the event. Their President, Tony Auld expressed their gratitude for the hospitality shown them.</p>

<p>BCS had a permanent Agricultural teacher for 1995 and as a result has been able to develop a long term plan for the Agricultural curriculum. This will continue for 1996, with a vocationally based course in Year 11, said teacher John Agren.</p>
<p>Burra’s Years 6 to 10 students take Agriculture as a compulsory subject and it is an option in Years 11 &amp; 12.</p>
<p>Two ‘farms have been used this year – one between the school and Smelts Paddock and the other at Kookaburra, behind the old Hampton Township. Ten acres were cropped at Kookaburra and ten at the school – mostly by Year 11 students.</p>
<p>The land near the school has copper toxicity problems and animals kept there too long die from copper overload. Onion weed and shallow soils also plague that site. All classes had some exposure to the led steers project, though the main work there was done by Years 11 &amp; 12 students. The result had been considerable success at the Royal Adelaide Show. Year 8 students had mainly reared the eight ‘bobby’ calves.</p>

<p>The Smelts Walk was opened by Professor Geoffrey Blainey on Saturday 9 December. Many of the ruins of smeltermen’s cottages, chimneys and the smelthouse were uncovered in a recent archaeological survey. The walk shows how ore was brought from the charge yards to be mixed with the flux and loaded into the furnaces. The walk also takes you through the stages of the smelting process. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Letter. Christmas message from Eva Pink, Chair of the Burra Traders’ Association.</p>
<p>Letter. Richard Holbrook, Chairman of Main Street Committee writes commending the upgrading of BP Burra by Richard &amp; Dawn Dollman.</p>
<p>Letter. John G. Monfries responds in a long letter to Cr John Oates’ recent long letter.</p>
<p>Over the past months we have heard a lot said about the Council and their management of community assets.</p>
<p>Throughout the Council has not asked the broader community for its views – even if it has consulted specific special interest groups.</p>
<p>This is quite apparent after the public meeting in August at the Old Courthouse.</p>
<p>Its response was to call a meeting of people involved in the tourist industry.</p>
<p>They were hardly likely to be critical of a body spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on their industry.</p>
<p>It is this type of approach that has led to the label ‘arrogant’.</p>
<p>[The writer goes on to condemn the lack of communication between the Council and the community and the lack of any time for questions from the community at Council meetings – or a forum of any sort for views to be expressed. Costs for Council agendas are $6 and likewise for a copy of minutes. He believes a Ratepayers’ Association is the only way for the community to be heard – all else having failed.]</p>
<p>Letter. David Baker also writes a fairly long letter spelling out the need for a Ratepayers’ Association:</p>
<p>Opposing views and diverse opinion are signs of a healthy community and democracy.</p>
<p>Elected representatives are expected to undertake the views of the majority and act upon them.</p>
<p>The Ratepayers’ Association is an ideal venue for elected people to hear views of some of the ratepayers.</p>
<p>Tourism will always be a part of the town and tourists will be made welcome.</p>
<p>But there are only a few – perhaps 15-20 that rely on tourism as their main source of income – mainly in the Bed &amp; Breakfast business.</p>
<p>Council does not pay rates and income tax on its businesses and has other unfair advantages in competing with other Bed &amp; Breakfast businesses.</p>
<p>Letter. John Oates writes to thank the paper for publishing his letter and says it has provided tremendous feedback.</p>
<p>‘ALL replies were positive at the time of writing.’</p>

<p>Burra’s Future</p>
<p>A joint meeting was held of Burra Traders’ Association, Burra Burra DC, the Main Street Committee &amp; Burra Residents &amp; Ratepayers’ Association. The main aim was to discuss key points in the report by Vincent Bourke, aimed at restoring a sense of community and increasing avenues of communication between the Council and the community – perhaps the need for something like a Burra Progress Association. This was seen as particularly pertinent in the face of a possible loss of an independent Burra Burra DC and a winding up of the Main Street Committee. A number of ideas were floated:</p>
<p>Promotion of more conferences and enhancement of facilities for same</p>
<p>A light industrial zone to encourage more businesses in Burra</p>
<p>Encouragement of home-based industries</p>
<p>The expansion of the school to agricultural college status</p>

<p>Mt Bryan School. Some of the pupils have been found to have significant levels of arsenic in recent tests. Household water tanks are suspected to be the source and the arsenic is believed to have come from dust raised in grading and removing ballast stone from the abandoned railway. This has been removed and crushed at Mt Bryan since early 1994. First grade stone is stockpiled and used on existing lines. The second grade is finer and the third is quite powdery. For years the weeds along the line were controlled by arsenic sprays.</p>

<p>Obituary. Ian Auhl 1914-96 (By Mary Woollacott.)</p>
<p>Ian Auhl died peacefully at his Burnside home on 22 March aged 81. Burra has lost one of its greatest visionaries and most devoted sons.</p>
<p>Back in the mid-1960s Ian was Principal of Burra Primary School and his love of the area was apparent in his early writings, published in the Burra Record. He drew attention to the wonderful and fascinating history of the town and its role in the destiny of South Australia. It took Ian’s research, writing and verbal communications skills to bring the knowledge of Burra as a special place to life. An early article was ‘The Girls of Hampton Court’. He later produced a history of the Unicorn Brewery Cellars in ‘In Cellar Cool’ and a history of the Burra Model School for its centenary in 1977. Last September he was proud to have the Local History Room at the Community Library named the ‘Auhl Local History Room’. His masterpiece was of course ‘The Story of the Monster Mine’ – the result of intense labour and meticulous research.</p>
<p>Ian was born in Burra in [27 December 1914] and returned as the Primary School Principal fifty years later until the end of 1967. Throughout his working life he taught at a number of places in SA before retiring due to ill health.</p>
<p>Despite writing books on several other places in the state, it was Burra that had a tenacious grip on his loyalties and he sometimes became a lone and even unpopular voice in his quest for the status he knew to be Burra’s natural right. Saving Burra’s buildings and with them out heritage became his obsession. To achieve this he enlisted the practical and moral help of other townspeople and the local National Trust Branch.</p>
<p>The Burra Conservation Study, which he undertook in 1978 drew many previously little known matters to the attention of those with the power to do something. There were moments when his zeal must have been a thorn in the side of the Town and later the District Council – indeed right up to the end. Today we have a well preserved, interesting and attractive town and much of the initial credit for this development goes to Ian Auhl’s determinism and perseverance over decades.</p>
<p>In 1979 he was awarded the OAM for his services to conservation, but his greatest reward was probably the proclamation by the Governor Dame Roma Mitchell of Burrs as one of the few heritage towns in the country, in February 1993. Ian was the first to admit that much of Burra’s history has yet to be written and to that end he and Eva donated money to the Library’s Research Awards to help with further exploration of our rich past.</p>

<p>BCS has purchased ‘Brewery Hill’, a 170 ha property overlooking Burra to the east. Most is grazing land, but about 40 ha is arable. The hill was previously the property of the Topsfield family. A $30,000 development grant from the Department of Primary Industries has been made available for the farm project as well as a large grant from the Education Department. The Department of Education and Children’s Services has provided a grant of $60,000 towards the purchase. The total investment will be $102,000. A parents’ forum this week was broadened to hear from two guest speakers about what was being done elsewhere – Mike Camac spoke about Cleve Area School and Dean Cresswell spoke as Assistant Principal at Urrbrae High School. Urrbrae has just been granted $16.4 million for a wide ranging development of the campus and curriculum – enabling development beyond wheat, sheep and cattle into horticulture, viticulture, environmental education, land care and associated technologies. Burra can look forward to developing projects with special focus areas for the farm, such as the use of contour banks, water harvesting, ‘alley’ farming, organic farming, rotational grazing and alternative agriculture.</p>

<p>Council Amalgamation discussions continued. The Mid North Local Government Region has released comments on proposals that Burra Burra DC will consider on 15 April and there will be a public meeting to canvass the issues in late April or early May.</p>
<p>The Government requires amalgamations and so far Kapunda and Light have successfully amalgamated and Angaston-Barossa and Tanunda are in the process.</p>
<p>A meeting of regional councils at Saddleworth on 3 April made progress on a potential pattern of amalgamation for the remaining Mid North Councils.</p>
<p>The current proposals involve:</p>
<p>Morgan, Ridley, Truro and Mannum to make a ‘River’ group.</p>
<p>Eudunda, Robertstown and Burra Burra with perhaps Hallett to form an ‘Eastern’ group.</p>
<p>Clare, Riverton, Saddleworth-Auburn with possibly Blyth-Snowtown to make a ‘Central’ group.</p>
<p>Blyth-Snowtown, Mallala and Wakefield Plains could make up a ‘Western’ group.</p>
<p>The councils concerned have yet to consider these suggestions and there would inevitably have to be some fine tuning and public consultation before any final action.</p>

<p>Council Amalgamations</p>
<p>Hallett DC Chairman, Peter Mattey updated residents on the amalgamation issue at meetings in Terowie and Hallett last Tuesday and Wednesday. He said there was no alternative to amalgamation and that Hallett Councillors considered the western cluster with Crystal Brook and Red Hill to be too remote and sought discussions with Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda Councils. A phase two memorandum had been signed with Peterborough Town and District Councils, but a number of issues were still to be resolved. An alternative to going with the north or the south grouping was to split Hallett and so go both ways. The Wednesday meeting asked the Council to enter phase 2 negotiations with the southern grouping and if possible to re-open the discussions with Jamestown and Spalding.</p>

<p>The Editor reprints part of an editorial from Issue 208 of 27 March 1995 about the long delay in getting an industrial zone for Burra. The editorial suggested it could be time to dismiss consultants Bone &amp; Tonkin.</p>

<p>Council Amalgamations</p>
<p>The southern group of Councils has approached Hallett to enter into merger discussions. Last night Jamestown and Spalding met with Hallett Council even though they are well advanced with their own merger talks. A large number of Hallett residents seem to favour a split in the district with some area going north and some south, but Peterborough Town &amp; District Councils are unenthusiastic about that idea. The southern option seems the only one still viable. Eudunda is arguing with Saddleworth-Auburn over an area of land near Marrabel and this may slow an outcome for Burra. It is hoped to present options to residents by the end of May.</p>

<p>Neil Page, business development advisor with the Mid North Development Board has reported to the Council on the future or tourism in Burra – especially in the light of Council mergers. He recommends that certain aspects of tourism operations be transferred to community hands (excluding Paxton Square Cottages and the Caravan Park). An independent board should be established and not a Section 199 Committee.</p>
<p>Finance for the Board’s operations should be a mixture of:</p>
<p>Tourism operations including the passport.</p>
<p>Council grants</p>
<p>Membership fees</p>
<p>Mid North Development Board</p>
<p>The Board should be encouraged to pursue the use of volunteer staff, traineeships and other CES or DEET incentives for employment.</p>

<p>Matt Reilly took a trio of old identities on a round trip through the eastern country that they were associated with when young. They were:</p>
<p>Ron Dewhirst (88), who had an accounting business in Booborowie until Trevor Willis took over some ten years ago. Ron recalled being a driller for I.J. Warnes in the 1920s and of riding his bike in from Koomooloo to play football in Burra.</p>
<p>Bob Radford’s family started at Glenora in 1892 and at Canegrass in 1903.</p>
<p>John McBride, also in his 80s started at 16 on a station out of Mannahill and spent nine years there, until war broke out. He was then stationed at Parafield and Mallala as a flying instructor, before being sent with 24th Squadron south of Darwin, from where sorties were run to Bali. After the war he went to Kia Ora, which he managed for forty years.</p>
<p>The group went out to Old Koomooloo, where Eddie Keogh and his team were shearing.

<p>Is relieved to finally receive some advice from the Burra Burra DC about the reform of councils in SA.</p>
<p>Wished to make the following points about council amalgamation:</p>
<p>There has been no open debate between the proponents of amalgamation and the community.</p>
<p>This means the community has not been made aware of any disadvantages.</p>
<p>The community has not been given the opportunity to express their wishes for or against amalgamation or in respect of the proposed partners in proposed amalgamation.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding was entered into without community consultation.</p>
<p>The community has not been advised of any possible savings or other long term benefits.</p>
<p>Will local government remain ‘local’ and can we be assured there will be no loss of local democracy?</p>
<p>We believe some form of open forum is needed.</p>

<p>Drew &amp; Crewes’ Building</p>
<p>The eastern wall of a storage shed at the rea of Drew &amp; Crewes’ building collapsed on Friday after heavy rains – perhaps the result of missing guttering. It was previously a storeroom for Drew &amp; Crewes’ and then Bence’s. Most recently it was tenanted by Off-beat Arts &amp; Crafts. Heritage advisor Douglas Alexander will advise on causes and a possible course of action.</p>

<p>Burra Residents &amp; Ratepayers’ Association held a well-attended meeting at the Sports Complex on Sunday afternoon and resolved to ask that the Council consider amalgamation with either Clare, Riverton and Saddleworth-Auburn or Robertstown, Eudunda and Part of Hallett. District Clerk, Steve Kerrigan explained the rate situation for the Burra Burra DC compared with the average for Clare, Riverton and Saddleworth-Auburn. Burra’s town rate was 46% higher and its rural rate 37% higher. He said Council had wished to gather enough information on merger proposals before calling a public meeting planned for 12 August. Council considered Burra would be better off if it remained the centre of a new district. Cr Kellock said that a number of Clare Councillors had said that they thought Burra’s eastern boundary was too far away and they did not want to include parts of Hallett, Robertstown or Eudunda.</p>

<p>Council Merger Meeting</p>
<p>Monday night’s public meeting was poorly attended, prompting Council Chairman Graham Kellock to conclude that people must be satisfied with what the Council was doing. He said that after much discussion the Council’s preferred option was to merge Burra Burra with Part of Hallett, Robertstown &amp; Eudunda. A Structured Reform Working Party from those four councils had been meeting since 4 June 1996 and had reported to the Local Government Boundary Reform Board. In response to questions he said:</p>
<p>The Clare, Riverton and Saddleworth-Auburn option was not favoured either by that group or by Eudunda and Robertstown.</p>
<p>Cr Kellock had favoured one large group comprising both the optional groupings, but this had been opposed by Eudunda and Riverton.</p>
<p>The population for the council areas concerned was:</p>
<p>Eudunda 1362</p>
<p>Robertstown 812</p>
<p>Part Hallett 260</p>
<p>Burra Burra 1971 For a total of 4405</p>
<p>Clare 4200</p>
<p>Riverton 1643</p>
<p>Saddleworth-Auburn 2294 For a total of 8137</p>
<p>Burra already co-operated with Hallett, Eudunda &amp; Robertstown on weed control and the Robertstown Council boundary was only 10 km from Burra.</p>
<p>On the other hand Burra and Clare Hospitals were linked and some Burra students went to Clare schools.</p>
<p>The proposed representation on a merged council would be:</p>
<p>Burra 5</p>
<p>Hallett 2</p>
<p>Eudunda 3</p>
<p>Robertstown 1</p>
<p>Harry Quinn thought that many Eudunda electors were unaware of their council’s activity concerning mergers and many of them favoured a merger with Morgan.</p>
<p>It was hoped to have the amalgamation in place by March 1997, in time for the next council elections.</p>

<p>Letter. Alan C.O. Hall writes suggesting that people did not attend the recent public meeting on Council amalgamations because Councillors have repeatedly said they will not take direction from ratepayers and so Burra will end up with Robertstown etc. regardless of the benefits of merging with Clare.</p>
<p>Letter. Jane and Peter Strawbridge write suggesting that the low attendance at the Council merger meeting was less an indication of agreement and more an indication of lack of confidence of ratepayers in direct consultation with Council. The recent Residents &amp; Ratepayers’ meeting urged a stronger effort to merge with Clare, with which Burra has much closer transport, hospital and tourism links than with Eudunda, Robertstown etc.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Burra has more interests in common with the growing economic centre of Clare and further investigation of the Clare amalgamation prospects should be pursued.</p>

<p>Hallett School Closure</p>
<p>A celebration was held at the Hallett School last Thursday, 26 September to mark its closure after 116 years. Children from Hallett were joined by those from Spalding and Booborowie for a day of fun and recognition. Numbers at the school had dropped to nine. Principal Shane Misso said in 1977 there were 74 at the school and at the start of 1996 there were 18. This fell to 10 as families left the district. [Photo of Mr Misso and students.]</p>

<p>Burra Show, 119 years old.</p>
<p>An article reviewing the history of the show makes the following points:</p>
<p>In 1925 memories placed the first show in 1875, but reports in the Adelaide Observer say the first show was actually in 1877. [There is no uncertainty about this; the first Burra Show is reported in the Burra News and Northern Mail 14 September 1877, Page 2.]</p>
<p>The first show was held in a walled enclosure of the old smelting works.</p>
<p>The first show was held in drizzling rain, but had a good attendance. Admission was 2/6 and 1/- after 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The show was held in the smelting yard for nine years, after which there was a recess until 1894.</p>
<p>The resurrected 1894 show was held at Victoria Park i.e. the Burra Oval.</p>
<p>The 1894 attendance was estimated at 2,300 and the society closed the year £100 in credit.</p>
<p>From 1877 till 1884 the show was followed by a banquet in the evening.</p>
<p>In 1895 a substantial stone building was erected for indoor exhibits. The society’s share of its cost was £90.</p>
<p>In 1897 the show was cancelled due to the appalling seasonal conditions of severe drought.</p>
<p>The show returned in 1898.</p>

<p>North Bungaree stud at Spalding is an offshoot of the Bungaree Stud founded in 1841. North Bungaree is now 90 years old and the Poll Stud is 41 years old. The property comprises 3,440 ha (8,500 acres) in a 500 mm (20 inch) rainfall area and devotes 6,500 acres to clover, ryegrass and natural grasses. It also produces cereals and hay. Shearing is done in September. Top price for a ram at 1995 field days was $1,500. Peter Riggs manages the property for Mary Hawker. North Bungaree sheep are known for large frames and deep bodies with soft handling medium wool.</p>

<p>Search at Sturt Vale</p>
<p>Police attended an abandoned car at Sturt Vale Station last Friday. It was found with two flat tyres and a distressed dog in it. They took the dog to Burra at 10 p.m. Meanwhile Nuriootpa Police had ascertained that Mrs June Moesing (58), the wife of the car’s owner, had left home at 1 p.m. on Thursday. A search was then organised to begin at first light. SES units from Adelaide, Pt Pirie, Burra, Hallett, Spalding and Laura participated along with CFS units from Riverland, Baldina, Burra &amp; the Eastern Districts. They were joined by two helicopters and the Burra Ambulance was on standby. Conditions were difficult due to rain making the roads slippery. The search continued on Sunday, when the dog was returned to the car and soon set off down the road. At 7.40 a.m. the woman was found alongside the road, suffering from exposure and dehydration. She was transferred to Burra Hospital. Burra Police officer Henderson praised the efforts of all involved in the search.</p>

<p>We came to Burra in 1946, just after the war and the partition of India – having left Kashmir and the lovely hill station of Darjeeling.</p>
<p>The first sight of Burra was of ‘a God forsaken place’, but they stayed long enough to have three sons and discover kind people, who never treated them like strangers.</p>
<p>Burra had been full of days of struggle after a life in India with servants and relaxation.</p>

<p>The Council Amalgamation Public Meeting</p>
<p>About 60 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Consultant Michael Barry was asked, ‘Where are the rate savings?’</p>
<p>Mr Barry replied ‘You won’t get it unless you give up significant reductions in service.’</p>
<p>[Ignore the double negative!]</p>
<p>The newsletter to householders said there would be a reduction of 3% in the total rates collected in the 1997-98 year, after which a rate equalisation program would be introduced.</p>
<p>Mr Barry said after the input of much work the working parties had come up with a workable solution.</p>
<p>John Monfries commented from the floor that if Councillors were not allowed to make the decision the Reform Board would step in and decide for them.</p>
<p>It was outlined that Burra rates would drop 9%.</p>
<p>Hallett’s would go up 20% over the ten year period, till parity was achieved.</p>
<p>The greatest concern overall was for local employment. The letter to householders said there was very little fat to be cut in District Councils and most of the benefits of amalgamation would be directed to protecting and improving levels of service delivery. If Government grants were cut in the future, it would be road maintenance that suffered the most. Past Council Chairman Jack McMahon spoke to say that he didn’t think they had any real choice but to make the most of the present changes.</p>

<p>Council Amalgamation. Public meeting at Hallett. 186 people attended.</p>
<p>Hallett Council Chairman Peter Mattey said that the Council recommended amalgamation with Burra Burra, Robertstown and Eudunda after lengthy debate and negotiations. This he said was the best deal they had been able to broker with surrounding councils.</p>
<p>Cr Sullivan said a full-time gang will be on construction, giving greater efficiency and Hallett would be rated at the rural rate. Rating parity would be achieved over ten years and the net debt would be eliminated by 2002.</p>
<p>Cr Mattey said councils to the west had vetoed efforts to merge with them and those to the north would not commit to a financial direction of a merged council.</p>
<p>John Hale, a past Councillor and Chairman objected to suddenly having to ‘get in bed with Burra’.</p>
<p>Robert Jenson from Terowie questioned the benefits for the northern wards and other speakers expressed concern about Burra’s debts.</p>
<p>Burra Burra DC’s Steve Kerrigan has since confirmed their council’s net debt of $456,418 less self-servicing loans of $492,613, which leaves Burra Burra with a surplus of $36, 195 at the end of June 1996.</p>
<p>(The self-servicing loans were: Paxton Square Cottages 253,984</p>
<p>Effluent Scheme 187,940</p>
<p>Sports Complex 7,274</p>
<p>Half Caravan Park’s loan of 86,831 )</p>
<p>A speaker from the Hundred of Whyte (to the west of Hallett) expressed a desire to amalgamate with the west where most of their shopping activities centred upon Jamestown.</p>
<p>It was explained that this could be done if the Hallett DC and the three western councils agreed.</p>
<p>Council Amalgamation. Public meeting at Terowie last Wednesday. 128 people attended – many of whom had also attended the Hallett meeting.</p>
<p>Cr Mattey said the proposed option would make the whole [Hallett] Council area one ward, represented by two Councillors. The western option offered Hallett Council area one representative.</p>
<p>Cr Hill gave an overview of the Council’s deliberations.</p>
<p>Cr Harvey said he had asked for a referendum on the western option.</p>
<p>The meeting was told the western option had not been open until the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Jamestown, Spalding and Rocky River Councils had already reached agreement and were due to lodge documents with the Reform Board early in November and that would finish the option currently available.</p>
<p>Councils could be admitted later, but conditions then applying were unknown.</p>
<p>Council Amalgamation. 58 people attended the ‘Have Your Say’ meeting at Robertstown.</p>
<p>Council Chairman Denis Keller outlined the proposal. The present proposal to merge with the Hallett, Burra Burra and Eudunda Councils followed exhaustive consultations with those councils and also with Saddleworth-Auburn, Clare, Riverton and Morgan in varying combinations. The perception that Burra and Eudunda’s debt structure was excessively high and unmanageable was totally unfounded. Burra’s total debt was $793,556, but 58% of that was self-supporting and 42% was met by Council revenue. It also had cash reserves of $337,000. Eudunda’s total loan commitments were $355,309. Its self-servicing loans were $15,339 and $89,168 was funded by Council cash and investments totalled $72,000. A general show of hands at the meeting favoured the proposal.</p>
<p>Council Amalgamation. The editor commented that Hallett and Terowie meetings showed that whatever the outcome, there will be a large group of dissatisfied ratepayers. Terowie residents who look to Peterborough for shopping have already had the door slammed in their face and Hallett’s western residents will likely miss out on increasing their ties with Jamestown. Intransigence however, could be counterproductive if it prolongs argument to the point where it is too late to enter into a new area on your own terms.</p>
<p>Letter. Michael Barry, consultant writes to clarify a point from the Burra Council Amalgamation meeting, reported in the issue of 23 October 1996.</p>
<p>‘Rate Savings Linked to Loss of Services’ fails however to convey the main focus of the meeting.</p>
<p>The article seemed to imply that I said that the four councils seeking to amalgamate would reduce services if they implemented rate reductions. This is not the intention of the four councils. Their intention is to reduce rates overall by 3% in the first year after amalgamation, while maintaining services. My view however, is that experience shows that rural amalgamations at best produce modest savings because:</p>
<p>Most rural councils already have little fat to cut.</p>
<p>All councils face increasing demands for new and improved services through State Government regulation and removal of services as a result of their cost cutting measures in rural areas.</p>
<p>Some of the savings will need to be diverted to specialist staff to tackle these new or improved services. If greater rate reductions were required in rural councils, then that could only come at the cost of reductions in service levels.</p>

<p>150 Years of the Burra Police</p>
<p>When copper was discovered at Burra in 1845 the nearest police were two mounted constables 30 miles away at Bungaree Station, where they were busy protecting the local flocks of sheep. In 1846 the Commissioner of Police, Captain Finnis came north to establish a police office and see to the appointment of a resident magistrate – made necessary by the Burra Burra Mine and the increased traffic on the North Road. Two mounted and two foot constables were allotted the area, though it took some time for them to arrive. The 150th anniversary of police in Burra will be marked by the visit of the Police Band, which will present a special concert in Redruth Gaol on Tuesday 26 November.</p>

<p>Morphett’s Engine House</p>
<p>Following their meeting on 29 October the Burra Burra DC has contacted the National Trust with a suggestion for including the unstaffed Morphett’s Engine House Museum on the Burra Passport. If no agreement is reached beforehand the Engine House will be closed from 29 November due to financial constraints. Council has been staffing the museum for two hours a day during the week and for three hours at weekends. Some months ago the National Trust proposed it manage and staff the building and pay the wages and involve the general community through a committee. The Council would make a financial commitment and share any profit. Council has delayed discussion until they work out how to place the Engine House on the passport. Once closed the mineral displays will be removed. The Van Buuren model of a beam engine, the audio system and the video commentary will remain.</p>

<p>The Burra Heritage advisory Committee convened a workshop at the Civic Centre last week, which was well attended by a cross-section of the community. The purpose was to hear ideas on the redevelopment of Market Square and Best Place. Douglas Alexander said it was not about bringing in a bulldozer, but to guide and inform relatively minor decisions that when multiplied would amount to a significant impact. Further consultation will follow in February or early March. Much of the input called for upgrading of existing facilities – the greening of both areas and more shade and seating. Other comments focused on the condition of roads and footpaths and the need for the parking of buses. Better signage, especially for Burra North was another issue. Better street furniture was another concern.</p>

<p>Christmas Message from Graham Kellock, Chairman of Burra Burra DC</p>
<p>When I took over as the Chairman six years ago I didn’t think I would be the last Chairman of the Burra Burra District Council. The new Regional Council of Goyder will cover a much wider area, but should supply the same wide ranging services, but more efficiently. This year has seen the sealing of the road from Morgan to ‘The Gums’ Station completed. Early in 1997 work will start from the Burra end to the Robertstown turn-off. The whole project will be completed in 1998. Plans have been drawn up to seal the Kooringa Road in the near future. This year Council has struggled to put its tourism budget on a more user-pays basis. The art Gallery was officially opened on 5 October. I thank the CFS and SES crews for their efforts in keeping the community safe. Thanks also go to all Council staff and elected members for their efforts.</p>

This is part of a $19 million upgrade, which when complete will see a sealed road from Morgan to Burra. The terrain between Burra and the Robertstown turn-off prevents a by-pass road. The road will re-open while the last section to ‘The Gums’ is completed.</p>

<p>Police are concerned about road safety in Market Square and Commercial Street, with heavy transports negotiating the area. Heavy vehicles carrying dangerous goods should be banned from the town area. To achieve this, the bypass road needs to be upgraded. Officer Kaiser suggested also that the give-way sign at the T-junction on Market Square should be replaced with a stop sign. (It is difficult to see traffic approaching from Kingston Street Bridge because of the Council Chamber). Council does not have the funds to seal the bypass, but the Department of Transport has agreed to extend the median into the Market Square, Commercial Street intersection.</p>

<p>The Four S.T. Gill Paintings have been valued by James Elder of Elder Fine Art Galleries at $300,000 to $400,000. He has suggested they could finance a major town project, such as the renovation of the hospital – possibly with a two to one subsidy from the Government of SA. He said they were of extreme historical importance and their conservation must be a concern for the local council. A likely purchaser would be the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. The Council has said the paintings are to be housed in Burra and it resolved at its last meeting that they would not be sold or permanently removed from Burra.</p>

<p>Letter. Russell Skinner, Chairman of the Main Street Committee writes to say he considers the closing of the ANZ Bank branch as but one aspect of the ugly face of the economic rationalism that is scorching rural communities as public utilities and commercial institutions centralise their operations. He regards their conveyance of the information in a form letter, with less than a month’s notice for customers to re-organise their financial arrangements, as appalling commercial ruthlessness. Perhaps rural communities like Burra need to consider establishing their own financial co-operative.</p>

<p>Housing in Burra. The demand for houses was about the same in 1996 as in 1995. 24 houses were sold in the Burra Burra DC area and the average price remained fairly steady. It was $52,204 in 1992 and $56,318 in 1996. 1993 was a boom year when 50 houses changed hands at an average price of $63,576. AdChem’s rationalisation has placed a number of houses on the market and at present there are a number of fine bluestones available in a buyers’ market. A number of Burra businesses are still doing well however, by appealing to a broader market. These include: Stephen Angel’s Décor Made Easy, Gary McPhee of McPhee’s Butchers and Saltbush Clothing. The sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road could see some boost to economic activity.</p>

<p>Goyder Council is considering the balance of fire services and possible savings. This comes after Cr Quinn asked that the Minister for Emergency Services be asked to look at the feasibility of withdrawing the Metropolitan Fire service (MFS) and transferring the responsibility to the CFS from 1 July. Naracoorte lost its MFS unit ten years ago and Eudunda three years ago. Burra MFS is staffed by 9 personnel and has responsibility primarily for the town area and has equipment specifically designed for urban fires. The MFS acquires surplus trucks from the Metropolitan Area at no cost. The Council is looking at ways of reducing the estimated $52,000 cost of fire protection in a financial year.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital was visited by an accreditation survey team last Wednesday and Thursday. The feedback was positive, but the written results of the survey will be some months away. The hospital celebrated its 120th birthday with a special cake at a celebration with patients, staff and the Ladies’ Auxiliary. The formal celebrations will be on 6 April, when a fair will be held in the hospital grounds. The hospital serves a wide area that includes Burra, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Farrell Flat, Hallett &amp; Robertstown districts. Over the years the board of management has constantly striven for improvements and innovation and in that has been greatly assisted by bequests and the commitment of the Ladies’ Auxiliary. The amalgamation of the Burra, Clare and Snowtown Hospitals last September saw the formation of the Burra Clare Snowtown Health Service Inc. Services will be reviewed over the next two years, including the provision of theatre, long stay and short stay beds. John Brak, Burra Hospital House Committee Chairman said the biggest threat facing country hospitals was the loss of theatre facilities and that will ultimately depend on government funds.

<p>BCS. The foundation stone of the old school building was laid 120 years ago on 27 February 1877 by Thomas Bath. It was built to accommodate 800 to 900 students at a cost of £6,976. Construction was by G. &amp; W. Sara and Dunstan. The opening of the Burra Hospital took place on the same day. The town celebrated with a half holiday – shops closed at noon and miners had time off. Sir Henry Ayers opened the hospital and after ‘a capital lunch’ the official party proceeded to the Burra Institute, from which a procession was formed to go to the school site. It was led by the Burra Brass Band, followed by 20 Freemasons, Oddfellows, Foresters and Rechabites, each order in full regalia. At the rear came the members of the Ministry present, the Mayor and Councillors of Burra, Mr Bath, etc. A crowd of almost 1,500 gathered at the school site, where Mr Bath as the earliest established businessman laid the foundation stone with a silver trowel made by Alfred Day, an Adelaide jeweller. The band then played the Song of Australia and the crowd then gave three cheers for The Queen, three for Mr Bath and three for the ladies. The official party ended the day with a fine dinner and the usual speeches. For the general public there was a musical and literary entertainment at the Institute.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital Gala Day celebrating 120 years of the Burra Hospital was held last Sunday. Special visitors were brothers Bob &amp; Peter Brunnitt [sic] descendants of one of Burra’s first doctors. The event was a great success. [Dr Robert Brummitt arrived in Burra in 1877. He stayed for 23 years and was very active in civic affairs, being Mayor December 1883-November 1884 and again December 1894- November 1897, but given that the mine opened in 1845, he can hardly be said to be one of the first doctors in the town.]</p>

Aberg &amp; Sons opened a butcher shop in Burra in 1933 and Ruth Aberg married Wilfred Garratt in 1935.]</p>

<p>The Burra Railway Line is planned to be sold by the Federal Government. The sale includes passenger rail, SA freight services and the Tasmanian Railway System. There have been more than 30 expressions of interest. AN says the broad gauge lines in SA’s Mid North are not viable. Studies by Rail 2000 however, suggest they are viable if not shackled to poor work practices. The Burra track is in a very bad condition and has been neglected, but is nevertheless adequate for the present rail traffic. [Bulk grain haulage.]</p>
<p>Those bidding for the SA lines appear to fall into two groups. One would aim to keep operating only the profitable main line grain services and the Leigh Creek coal traffic. The other would want to rehabilitate the system, including branch lines, with a long term regional commitment. Rail 2000 is concerned that the government will take the highest bidder without reference to long term implications for SA.</p>

<p>Letter. Joe Kazimour of Joe’s Super Snacks, Prices Bakery and Golden Fried Chicken writes a very long letter, taking exception to the decision-making process re his illuminated sign that was recently disallowed for his business in Market Square. Some of his points:</p>
<p>When he invested in the Golden Fried chicken franchise the deal included an internally illuminated two-sided sign designed to be set at 90o to the building and high enough for all to see.</p>
<p>When he applied for permission to erect the sign the initial reactions from John Brak and Douglas Alexander (Heritage Adviser) were so negative that he immediately regretted having placed the order for the franchise.</p>
<p>Although the sign carried a trademark registered all over Australia, the Council wanted a change of colour and design.</p>
<p>He agreed to mount the sign flat against the parapet.</p>
<p>He then found that a single-sided sign cost as much as a two-sided one ($500) so he opted for the latter and applied for permission to mount it at 90o to the parapet – and was refused.</p>
<p>Mr Alexander objected because:</p>
<p>This was contrary to what he was originally advised.</p>
<p>The site was highly visible in Market Square, the focus of the State Heritage Area, which would be adversely affected.</p>
<p>The corporate design and colouring are not sympathetic to the individual historic character of the square.</p>
<p>The sign would lead to the proliferation of similar inappropriate signage.</p>
<p>If Council did not adopt Mr Alexander’s recommendation it would be necessary to obtain the concurrence of the Development Assessment Commission.</p>
<p>Mr Kazimour then comments on the already installed illuminated signs – some at 90o to the buildings on the Service Stations, BankSA, Hotels and Lotteries Commission – BUT let’s not disturb ‘Big Businesses’.</p>
<p>Council voted to allow the sign 6 votes to 2.</p>
<p>Mr Kazimour then writes at length on the negative decision of the Development Assessment Commission and the biased way it rushed into its decision, railing against the role of the Heritage Adviser and the consequent negative impact on the town’s economic progress as the result of such heritage nonsense that is supported by ‘Douglas Alexander and his Heritage Stooges’.</p>

<p>SA Tourism is enjoying high bed occupancy rates, but local responses are mixed. Country SA recorded a 3% increase in the last quarter. Barry Wright of Tiver’s Row Cottages said they had 47.2% occupancy in December 1966 quarter, up 5% on 1995, but summer occupancies are the downfall. Paxton Square income for 1996-97 is expected to fall by 20% from the previous year.</p>

<p>Letter. Dawn Broderick writes a letter vaguely in support of Joe Kazimour, but largely comprising a meandering set of reminiscences of the good old days of her youth.</p>

<p>Letter. Bob Skinner writes applauding Joe Kazimour’s attempt to increase his business and so benefit the town, but he goes on to question some of Joe’s outrage:</p>
<p>It would seem that Mr Kazimour could still display his sign flat against the parapet, as he said he agreed to. (Any safety issues could surely be overcome.)</p>
<p>As for existing garish signs, they are not in keeping with heritage values and he hopes they will go in time.</p>
<p>Advertising can be eye-catching and effective without being offensive. He feels Mr Kazimour does the Council CEO and planning officers an injustice – they can only advise the Councillors as to the legal requirements and recommended planning procedure.</p>
<p>Letter. Shaun Dollman also writes in support of Joe Kazimour:</p>
<p>‘standing up for the little people of this town.’</p>
<p>‘Is the same thing going to happen with the Main Street/Best Place Plan concept program. We want our opinions to be heard, not just pushed under the rug.’</p>
<p>Letter. P.L. &amp; D.J. Strawbridge also write in support of Joe Kazimour, following rejection of their signage proposal as well: because it was ‘overly ornate&hellip;free standing, and signage was excessive.’</p>

<p>Regional Council of Goyder</p>
<p>The new council reduced its elected from 29 on amalgamation to 13 at the council election. Valid votes were cast by 2330 of the 3,652 persons eligible: a 63.8% response. A further 90 invalid votes were received with the declaration flap removed or incorrectly completed. 44 envelopes also came in too late to be counted. This may have affected the outcome in Eudunda Ward, where there was a tie after the distribution of preferences, between R. Leditschke and J. Wibberley. Returning officer Stephen Kerrigan then had to draw a name ‘out of the hat’ to decide the candidate to be excluded. Mr Wibberley’s name was drawn out.</p>

<p>Burra Show Society. Mrs Jean Jamieson has been Secretary-Treasurer for more than 20 years and has announced she will retire at the next AGM in 1998. She took over the role in 1976 from Darrell Field and was in the position when the ring was enlarged in 1977. President at the time, Mr Ron Shipard praised her for her effort over the years. This year the show will feature a ute competition and another Miners Revolution dance in the evening. Changes are planned for the state finals of the Miss Showgirl Competition after the 1998 finals – the competition will then have both male and female participants – both to move with the times and to obtain better sponsorship returns. A Young Citizen Award will replace it. The Burra Show will not end the Show Girl Competition locally, but some changes will be announced next week.</p>

<p>Market Square – Best Place Changes – Public Meeting</p>
<p>More than 60 residents attended the meeting to discuss the plans that have been on display. Douglas Alexander, Heritage Adviser led the discussion. Concerns included the need for trees no to obstruct businesses, better footpaths, improved lighting, better signage and some wanted business façades improved. Overall they wanted little physical change to the square. Some better organisation of parking, more colour and some more trees. Generally people left calmer, with fears of wholesale change allayed.</p>

<p>Henry Cullen was given a morning tea on Friday on his retirement. His father, Lance took over the Eastern Mail Run in 1949 and Henry has since covered more than a million miles making deliveries on the route.</p>
<p>[Photo of Henry Cullen, his wife Dot and postmaster Brian Hastelow.]</p>
<p>Lance Cullen began on the run on 1 August 1949. He had a semi-trailer and carried fuel, general goods and provisions as well as the mail. The route was Glenora, Woolgangi, Koomooloo, Braeside, Sturtvale, Quondong (overnight stop), Oakbank, Oakvale (near the NSW border), then Oakbank, Morganvale, Canopus, Pine valley, Canegrass, Balah, Redcliffe, Grassville, Koomooloo and back to Burra. This was a distance of c. 380 miles or 600 km. Starting at 1.30 p.m. on Friday, they returned at about 6 p.m. on Saturday, if all went well. On one occasion when heavy rain fell mid-route they returned the following Friday, just in time to re-load and set off again. Roads were then often just bush tracks and at one time the trip meant encountering 156 gates. Lance convinced some graziers to install cattle grids, which he delivered free of charge. In mid-1966 Lance was unsuccessful in the tender for the renewal of the contract and it went to another person. Lance and Henry then continued with the weekly delivery of goods, fuel and provisions. It was estimated that in the first seventeen years of the mail contract Lance travelled c. 350,000 miles of 560,000 km.</p>
<p>At other times the Cullens would be out east carting wool.</p>
<p>During 1968 the Cullens regained the mail contract. Lance Cullen retired from the mail run in April 1969, to be succeeded by son Henry, who carried on for a further 28 years and now is ready to hand the job on to his son Rodney.</p>
<p>About 25 years ago they could do the run with a smaller vehicle because the fuel began to be delivered to the properties in bulk rather than in drums. The big problem affecting the run was always rain. At one time the semi-trailer got bogged down to its tray! Even as recently as last February the run had to be done by two vehicles because the circular route was cut by flood water – in one section to a depth of 6 m. Some of the road now has a reasonable surface, but there are still 39 gates and sections of bush track. There have also been changes in the route. It now includes such stations at South Dam, Kia Ora and Braemar, which lie further north than the original route. Some of the original stations are no longer occupied. The service now leaves at 9.30 a.m. and all being well returns at 6 p.m. the same day, having covered c. 530 km.</p>

The Council will subsidise the loan to the tune of $10,000 p.a. for the first five years, after which the club becomes fully responsible for all repayments. The club applied for a grant of $150,000 from the Department of Sports and recreation in February this year and the success of their application will be known at the end of this month. The Council’s offer remains open for 12 months.</p>

<p>Burra-Morgan Road</p>
<p>The newly opened sealed road has seen motorists travelling faster, but there is a need to be aware of emus and kangaroos. The road was opened by local MP Ian Venning this week, after the completion of the $19.6 million upgrade. It had been closed since January to allow the 15 km section through the Burra Hills to be reconstructed and sealed. It is still under construction with 30 km yet to do between the Robertstown turn-off and ‘The Gums’ and that will be completed before the end of 1998. It will provide another quick and efficient route for freight between east and west as well as better access for tourists to the Burra creek Gorge. The section from Burra to Robertstown turn-off was closed because the terrain meant a bypass was not possible.</p>

<p>Vincent Burke contributed an article stating that Burra had to face some hard facts about the changing demographic structure of the town and district and the impact of those changes on its economic future and state of health. He was concerned that overall there had been a loss of retailing in the Market Square precinct, especially relating to food and basic needs. Ten shops were presently vacant. The school population had declined by 30% over 15 years. There had been a loss of some essential services and threats to others. He included a number of statistical tables as supportive evidence:</p>

There will then be a short heritage walk, which will include Malowen Lowarth. After that there will be time for visitors to purchase lunch before a local coach town tour. The tour will end with afternoon refreshments at the Mobil Roadhouse followed by the return coach trip to Adelaide. All up the cost will be $65 per person, including the coach, morning tea, morning walk, town tour with entry to the Mine Site, Morphett’s Enginehouse, Redruth Gaol and the Miners’ Dugouts and afternoon tea.</p>

<p>Letter. Anthony Thorogood writes in response to Vincent Burke’s rather pessimistic view of the decline of the town and district. He sees it more as a readjustment to changing circumstances. People are travelling longer distances to shopping complexes. Population statistics don’t take into account weekenders and so make population decline seem worse than it is in reality. There is opportunity in Burra for a varied mix of ‘New Age’ tourist businesses. Burra is readjusting rather than dying.</p>

<p>Editorial on Industrial land in Burra.</p>
<p>Past Councils have been lethargic in obtaining a constructive outcome in regards to an industrial zone for Burra and their consultants have been remarkably slack. The Council had asked for ideas on revising the then Supplementary Development Plan, but apparently have not had a single response in writing. The danger is that if no responses come in by the end of the month nothing will change.</p>

<p>Credit Union</p>
<p>Public meetings at Burra &amp; Eudunda last week called for a working party to report back on the feasibility of a credit union and to outline the options. More than 70 people attended in Burra and 35 in Eudunda. Two representatives of Credit Care addressed the meeting in Burra. Credit Care advises communities interested in setting up a credit union. The representatives said banks had made a commercial decision to withdraw from rural Australia to maximise profits for shareholders. Credit unions’ responsibility was to their members and so channel their profits into better service and social programs. Typically credit unions only allow 10% of loans for commercial services and so no one has lost money in credit unions in the last 25 years. Credit unions can issue their own cheques. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Mr H.G. Scholz, an ex-Eudunda Councillor has enquired about the cost of changing to postal elections for Council. Steve Kerrigan, CEO of Goyder Council has answered:</p>
<p>The cost of the postal ballot was $7,895.</p>
<p>The cost of the election using polling booths as previously would have been $7,533.</p>
<p>The cost of an election if booths were reduced in number to just four would be $5,943.</p>
<p>He felt that the extra cost was well justified by the significantly higher turn-out of voters.</p>
<p>The Burra-Morgan Road is expected to be completed up to five months ahead of schedule at a cost of $19.6 million – perhaps as early as May 1998. The road was re-opened in July, but motorists are urged to use other routes wherever possible as there are significant delays on the section under construction between the Robertstown turn-off and ‘The Gums’.</p>

<p>Mongolata Gold Mine has been the focus of interest by the mining exploration company Redfire Resources for a number of weeks. They were investigating the feasibility of open cutting the hill currently being mined by Kevin Wallis and eventually they would focus on the possibility of mining underground in the sulphide zone below the water table. In the 1930s the Mongolata Mine yielded about one ounce per ton with occasional richer pockets of gold. An open cut would require the movement of some 45 million tons of rock to yield perhaps 4 grams per ton.</p>
<p>Kevin Wallis continues to make wages out of his gold mine using traditional mining techniques. Byles Mine faces the east, with the main adit dug into the hill some 250 m and finishing c. 60 m below the surface. A narrow set of rails runs along the mine adit, which is shored up with timber and which passes various side drives and dead ends before opening up at a main shaft to the surface. Tunnelling proceeds beyond the end of the rails. The adit slopes slightly upwards to facilitate the removal of ore in trucks holding almost a tonne. The side drives indicate the amount of work done in the 1930s. Around a bend is a second major shaft that plunges to the water table at the 420 ft level. The water table is 100 ft lower than when the mine closed at the end of the 1930s. Kevin has had a relatively safe operation, except when a false floor collapsed, burying him waist deep at the next level.</p>
<p>Years ago specimen gold was stored in wheat bags in the underground gold vault. In the 1930s one 6 kg specimen of gold was found in the hills behind Wildildie and there were other finds almost as good. Kevin has encountered some small richer deposits and some veins average 300 ounces per ton in the old diggings. Kevin uses the old 10 stamp crusher that originally came from Mt Grainger near Oddlawirra in 1933. It accepts ore up to 4 inches in diameter, crushing it to sand. This is then washed down over large amalgam plates, copper sheets covered in mercury to which the gold grains attach. This is then retorted, evaporating off the mercury, leaving a gold ‘sponge’, which is then melted into a gold bar.</p>
<p>During its busy phase in the 1930s Mongolata had a cluster of miners living nearby, with a general store and post office, with mail delivered twice a week and fortnightly church services.</p>

<p>Kangaroo numbers have risen following reasonable rains over the past year. Andrew Michelmore is a professional shooter based in Burra, who says numbers have increased so that they are seen everywhere to the east. He is currently working on Collinsville Station 60 km northeast of Burra. In large numbers kangaroos can cause major damage to farming and pastoral properties, ruining crops and competing with livestock for food and water.</p>
<p>Andrew operates four or five nights a week. The meat is sold to Macro Meats, the largest processor of kangaroo meat in SA, who purchase kangaroo meat from some 30 or so shooters. Other operators in the area are:</p>
<p>Mark Brooks at Hallett</p>
<p>Terry Skelton at Glenora</p>
<p>Damien Miller &amp; Rick Murphy at Koomooloo, Yunta and Sturtvale.</p>
<p>Kangaroo harvesting is undertaken by licensed shooters with permits issued by State authorities to work where it considers kangaroos are causing damage.</p>
<p>Carcases are tagged and checked to ensure legality and skins are exported to tanneries and leather works in Europe and SE Asia.</p>
<p>The Broadcaster reporter went on a shoot:</p>
<p>Requirements are that kangaroos are hanging on the truck and bled within three minutes of being shot. After twelve carcases were hung, the shooter stopped to dress them – heading and gutting them in turn. The second dozen came in less than half an hour. They were western grey kangaroos weighing up to 40 kg. Shortly after midnight they had a full load of 43 and they returned to weigh the catch and to the chiller. Throughout the night’s hunt Andrew had only needed a second shot once.</p>

<p>BCS. The development of a goat herd at the school has created much interest from both the students and passers-by. A little over a year ago it began with goats caught from ‘out east’. These were supplemented by animals from Mongolata and Quondong, donations of tame goats and the purchase of 12 dairy goats. All the feral nannies were in kid when captured and so kids appeared at intervals. A Boer buck and two pure Boer nannies were purchased in March and soon produced kids – the first arriving in early August. Boer-feral crosses followed. The dairy does were mated with an Anglo-Nubian buck before arrival. The ferals shed ‘Cashmere’ towards spring and students have combed this off and it has been passed on to weaver Jenny Statton. Overall there are now some 60 goats. They have all learned to respect electric fences and so far have not breached them. Shelter is vital and trees have been planted for them. There is a market for goat meat at $2 per kg dressed.</p>

Alan Botting has been working hard at promoting the town with new brochures and pursuing a major event in the form of an Arts &amp; Music Festival in February-March 1999 that would include an innovative stage on the Mine Pool. Other projects include a ‘Bluebird’ train service to Burra for special events, a Merino Capital Museum and a new range of local tours. All this is having a positive effect on the local traders’ turnover.</p>

<p>Redfire Resources – Annual Report</p>
<p>Entered a joint venture agreement to cover the tenement covering the Mongolata Goldfield area.</p>
<p>Identified two target areas within 5 km of Burra.</p>
<p>Burra Copper Mine produced 2.7 million tons of ore [in the 1970s] averaging 3% copper, up to its closure in 1981 and copper occurrences are present north and south of the historic mine.</p>
<p>Mongolata has a series of gold workings along a 12 km zone and was actively worked in the 1930s. Targets to the east under alluvium have been identified by recent government aerial magnetic surveys.</p>
<p>Tooralie lies on the eastern boundary of the company’s tenements and covers an area greater than 1000 km 2. Recent mapping and magnetic data indicate the area is highly prospective for gold and base metal deposits.</p>

<p>Burra Art Gallery</p>
<p>Chairman of Goyder Council, Denis Keller officially opened the next stage of the development of the Burra Art Gallery recently at a special preview of the Russell Morrison exhibition. He was welcomed by the retiring President of the McDouall Stuart Board, Judge Andrew Wilson.</p>
<p>The gallery building was originally constructed in 1860</p>
<p>It was used as the Kooringa Telegraph Station and Post Office for 100 years before the opening of the Post Office in Market Square.</p>
<p>After a 1993 petition with 450 signatures the Burra Burra DC purchased the building for use as an art gallery.</p>
<p>The Gallery Board was formed the following year to oversee the preparation of plans and to raise funds to restore the building.</p>
<p>To date more than $60,000 has been obtained from the State Government and half as much again is needed to finish the task.</p>
<p>Much is owed to the drive and vision of Susan Roche.</p>
<p>The Gallery was officially opened a year ago by Mr Kym Bonython.</p>
<p>In addition to the hard work of the Board the Gallery owes much to the input of its many volunteers, especially to Len Bence, Glenys Christopher and members of the local artists’ group and of course, to the former Burra Burra DC led by Graham Kellock.</p>

<p>Advertisement &amp; Article: Peacock’s Chimney</p>
<p>It is 25 years since the re-siting of the chimney at the entrance to the mine. This was undertaken by the Burra National Trust in 1971-72. Dismantling was carried out by Trust members Gerry O’Connor, Murray Tiver and Dudley Cockington. The chimney was dismantled without scaffolding [!] from the inside. Each stone was marked with different coloured paint for each layer so that re-assembly could be done in the right order. Gerry and Carmel O’Connor donated the land for the re-siting. The foundation block was poured by hand, using three cement mixers and volunteer labour. Dedication was done during the first Burra Copper Festival by the Governor, Sir Mark Oliphant. A plaque commemorating the 25th anniversary will be unveiled by the Governor, Sir Eric Neal on 18 October after a free champagne breakfast at the site. [1972 photo.]</p>

<p>In 1977 I gained employment with Matthews Emporium in Burra and was trained in floors, curtains and furniture and eventually also took over buying and selling of men’s and ladies’ clothes as well as the furniture department. After winning a number of awards for window dressing, I undertook Interior Design and Decorating courses. In 1987 Ross &amp; Dianne Drew decided to close the Emporium. In October of that year with the support of Maryanne, we bought the original furniture building of Matthews and started Décor Made Easy.</p>
<p>In later years we have contracted our floors to Adrian Green and curtains to Russell Murphy.</p>
<p>In the last few years we have opened up ‘Creative Displays’ – for wedding receptions and public dinners – most recently the Opera in the Outback displays. Our next plan is to employ another person to be trained full-time, as I was twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Malowen Lowarth has been found to house a rare quilt. Jenny Manning, who is researching for her book The Australian Quilters Directory visited Burra on 11 December, especially to view the quilt. Embroidered on it is the inscription ‘AN to SN 1829’. Jenny examined it carefully and believes it probably originated in England and is done in a naïve primitive style. She also believes it to be among the five oldest quilts in Australia. It came to Burra from National Trust Headquarters in Ayers House, Adelaide about ten years ago.</p>
<p>Aged Care.</p>
<p>Burra may receive up to four more lower-care aged places out of 24 allocated within the Wakefield Region. If approved this may see some redevelopment at Burra Hospital to meet Commonwealth standards and providing a home-like environment for nursing home and hostel type residents. This in turn means that acute services would be separated from the aged care component of the hospital. No change to acute care is currently being discussed.</p>

<p>Policing in Burra.</p>
<p>Some Burra residents have been concerned about how the district has been policed recently and on Monday night this concern surfaced on the Channel 7 news. Matt Reilly was one of those who spoke to the press, but says there were a number of inaccuracies in the item that just made them sound like a bunch of whingers. As a result there will be a public meeting on the issues raised. Tonight those who feel they would rather a spokesperson took their concerns to the public meeting will meet together at the Civic Centre. The public meeting will be held in the Burra Town Hall at 8 p.m. on 18 December. Guests will be the Chief Inspector Jim Langmead, Officer in charge of North East Division and Senior Sergeant Dean Harris of Peterborough Police.</p>

<p>Terowie Institute was built in 1879 and has been undergoing restoration. In 1995-96 and 1996-97 financial years $25,000 was spent on replacing the roof, re-wiring and repairing and repainting the interior. The cost was split between Council and the local community. The present financial year has seen work focused on the exterior walls and plaster work. This required $1,110 to be raised locally, plus $1,250 from Goyder Council and a loan from Council of $1,250.</p>

<p>Public Meeting re Over-policing</p>
<p>More than 300 people attended the meeting called as a result of pressure on senior police to address allegations of over-policing. Council CEO Steve Kerrigan acted as an independent convenor and said has view was that what was needed was an atmosphere of two-way commitment between the police and community. Police were represented by Superintendent Dave Eason from Adelaide, Divisional Commander Jim Langmead from Pt Pirie and senior Sergeant Dean Harris from Peterborough.</p>
<p>Jim Langmead said police resources had been directed towards reducing the road toll through random breath tests and speed detection and they could make no apologies for that.</p>
<p>Local farmer Graham Kellock said constant radar guns and breatho’s in front of businesses were discouraging people from coming into town.</p>
<p>Matthew Reilly spoke of being inundated with complaints about police officers.</p>
<p>Rosemary Seaford said that as a representative of senior women, she described policing now as rude, arrogant, intimidating, threatening and demeaning. She wanted a return to firmness and respect and called for respectful and confidential policing – to which she received a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Charlie Bourne, wishing to represent the younger generation, said he had no issue with the law, but urged officers to act with dignity and honour.</p>
<p>James Hawker spoke in support of Officer Russell Disher who is currently on stress leave.</p>
<p>Jack McMahon said you couldn’t umpire without a whistle and acting now could avert a problem down the track.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Eason said everyone’s personalities were different and if they had genuine concerns they were there to see if they could fix it.</p>
<p>Gary Illicevs, a resident with 17 years police experience, said the police needed to have the confidence of the town – ‘we are not complaining about the law’.</p>
<p>Rosemary Seaford moved a motion prepared by a meeting of about 60 locals held the previous night:</p>
<p>‘That the residents of Burra and the surrounding districts object to the aggressive policing of officers Cousins and Kaiser, and the adverse affect [sic] this has on our community. It creates a definite sense of loss for the community: that the SA Police Department note that this is a vote of no confidence in the two officers and that action be taken to replace them with officers respected, knowledgeable and experienced in community policing.’</p>
<p>This motion was amended to say that the Burra community wait until the police investigation is made until the issue of no confidence is further considered.</p>
<p>The amendment was carried 125 to 110.</p>
<p>Six people were then elected from the meeting to consider the issues raised with senior police and then report back to the community as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Issue 342, 24 December 1997, page 2</p>
<p>Letter. Elic Gillett from Hampshire writes as a third time visitor and with due respect to comment on the public meeting re policing – which he understands to be largely in relation to spot fines on drivers who had exceeded the legally permitted amount of alcohol in their blood. Firstly he is surprised that a fine is considered appropriate, because in most European countries the penalty would be loss of licence for three to twelve months. Secondly he is surprised that a small number of people think it worthwhile to arrange a public meeting to criticise the police for carrying out the job they are paid for.</p>
<p>Letter. Bob Skinner writes to praise Steve Kerrigan for the manner in which he handled the difficult meeting on policing in Burra.</p>

<p>Letter. Avian Pink writes re proposed changes to the constitution of Burra traders’ Association, aimed at widening its parameters to include tourism.</p>
<p>Regardless of the tourism issue the constitution need updating.</p>
<p>If adopted the change would simply place tourism matters on the same level as business, commerce and industry and broaden the membership base.</p>
<p>Burra would have one strong association to liaise with the Council and the National Trust.</p>
<p>If the Traders’ Association stays unchanged then the growing interaction at local, state and national levels in business, commerce and tourism development will not be serviced adequately.</p>

<p>Burra Traders’ Association is unable to alter its constitution because it did not get an 80% response to its request to go ahead with a meeting on the matter, as required by its constitution. Vice-President, Terry Wilson thought it a shame that the members were not even prepared to put the question to a vote yes or no. For those interested in forming a tourism association, it seems they will have to start from scratch. The National Trust is keen for such an independent body to be formed, because it would free the Trust to concentrate more fully on their key task of maintaining the sites they own in the town.</p>

<p>Letter. Vincent Burke writes re a tourism Association.</p>
<p>The attempt to achieve an expanded and unified organisation via the Burra Traders’ Association has failed, which is a great pity. Tourism is a vital part of the town’s economy and it is important to have an organisation that is separate from the National Trust. A public meeting is therefore called for Thursday 26 February to proceed with the establishment of a Burra Business &amp; Tourism Association. We are keen to include the ‘Unique Accommodation’ group, hotels, motel, caravan park, antique shops and any business with a link with tourism or that provides a service to those directly involved.</p>

<p>The Burra-Morgan Road</p>
<p>The sealing project for the Burra-Morgan Road was officially opened by the Minister of Transport and Urban Planning, Diana Laidlaw. Councils had been lobbying for the sealed road for about sixty years. The Minister unveiled a plaque.</p>
<p>The Road building and sealing was undertaken by L.R.M. Constructions and overseen by Luigi Rossi of the Department of Road Transport. At one point the road was closed for seven months to speed up the process. The dry winter in 1997 may not have pleased farmers, but helped to bring the project in early and under budget. Already traffic on the road has increased. Burra traders are commenting on the number of buses using it as well as truckers, holidaymakers and boating enthusiasts. It is part of the shortest east-west route across Australia. The opening was also marked by a Bicycle Blitz. Eighty breakfasts were served on the banks of the Burra Creek at Burra before Graham Gunn flagged off the first two riders – Brian Thamm and Ivan Venning (Member for Schubert) at 8.30 a.m. In all 137 riders participated. The ride went to ‘The Gums’ for the official opening of the road by the Minister, Hon. Diana Laidlaw and then continued on to Morgan, where prizes were presented. The first solo finisher was Kathy Bruce, the first senior team was Peterborough Football Club and the first junior team was Goyder Student Boarding Hostel. Some fundraising during the ride meant that $569 will be split between Burra and Morgan ambulance Units.</p>

<p>Mary Warnes Community Room (The Baby Care Room)</p>
<p>The room will be officially opened on 24 April. It will be opened by Carolyn Cooke, granddaughter of Mary Warnes. It was first mooted as a project in 1994, when the old swimming pool facilities were vacated. They proved unsuitable and after consultation with the Council, they made the space between the Visitor centre and the former Boulger store available. Many of the town’s contractors have worked on the site and have donated a wide door for double pram and wheelchair access, a sink with hot and cold water, a large change trolley and bench and a playpen area for toddlers and comfortable seating. The CWA, which was founded in SA by Mary Warnes, has also been a supporter.</p>

Water from the dam will be used to green the fairways and tees and later for the greens. A creek has been made from the Barrier Highway area to run water from the pipeline to the dam. Soil from the dam site will now be used as a base for the tees and greens. Eventually holes 3 &amp; 4 will be repositioned to give 8 holes on the east side of the highway and 10 on the western side, with holes 9 and 18 finishing at the clubhouse.</p>

<p>The Mary Warnes Community Room was opened on Friday by Ms Carolyn Cooke, granddaughter of Mary Warnes. In 1994 it was suggested that the buildings at the old swimming pool could become a baby’s changing room. After much discussion, the Council offered the small storage space adjacent to the Visitor Centre for conversion to a safe, comfortable and hygienic area to feed and change babies. There were a couple of disabled local teenagers who also needed these facilities. More than 24 local groups and families donated goods and money. A number of generous local tradespeople were also vital in getting the place transformed. It will be open during Visitor Centre hours and will be maintained and cleaned by Council. Mr Graham Kellock represented the Council and was presented with a certificate of accreditation to say the room meets criteria set down by the Nursing Mothers’ Association of Australia and the Australian Parent Magazine. After the opening the CWA provided morning tea. [2 photos.]</p>

<p>Terowie Cemetery</p>
<p>The 1998 Clean Up Australia Day effort saw two trailer loads of rubbish, weeds, clippings etc. removed. Since then Deryck Skinner has put in much effort to tidy the cemetery. A number of descendants of early residents have indicated an interest in marking previously unmarked graves of relatives. Albert Kloester has worked on behalf of a number of families to restore grave sites and to exterminate large colonies of aggressive ants on site. Deryck and Sue Miller have undertaken to uniformly mark all presently unmarked graves. John Aver Mitchell was the founder of Terowie. He was a Scot born in 1832 and died in Terowie in 1879. In March 1872 he purchased Section 158 in the Hundred of Terowie and built the Terowie Hotel on the edge of the Section. He then had the rest of the Section (and later other areas) surveyed into town allotments. Terowie CMC is setting up a fund to restore Mitchell’s grave for the 120th anniversary of his death in 1999.</p>

<p>The Regional Council of Goyder has applied to the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program for funds to develop a copper interpretive centre at the Burra Mine at a cost of $750,000. This would complete the Burra Mine Museum and provide visitors with a unique experience. It is the first opportunity to seek such a grant since the SA Sesquicentenary. Morphett’s Enginehouse would be the main focus and there would be three primary components:</p>
<p>Reconstruction of Morphett’s Boilerhouse.</p>
<p>Construction and installation of a full size replica Cornish Beam Engine.</p>
<p>Essential maintenance of the Enginehouse and reintroduction of the Shears to the Enginehouse to support the main beams.</p>
<p>The centre would explain how the mine worked, how it gave the almost bankrupt colony a sense of well-being and how the town represents the earliest example of transplanted Cornish mining and domestic architecture in Australia.</p>
<p>The application also seeks to link Burra with Federation through the person of Sir William F. Holder, a resident of Burra 1876-91, being Mayor of the town on two occasions and Premier of SA in the 1890s before being elected to the first Federal Government in 1901 and becoming its first Speaker. The centre would feature a Sir William F. Holder room.</p>

<p>Fire. MFS &amp; CFS units were busy in Burra last weekend with two house fires. The first was in Crowan Street, Burra North on Saturday 4 July.

<p>The Police Community Consultative Committee [PCCC]</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Jim Langmead discussed the possibility of a PCCC with a group at Burra Activities Centre on 29 June. It would be the first such committee in SA. It had been thought that the first committee would be at Pt Pirie, but the troubles experienced in Burra had prompted it as a better choice. The complaints from the original public meeting had been followed up and resolved in an informal manner. A community survey is planned and Burra will provide a benchmark with 1,200 being included in the survey.</p>
<p>Some disquiet was expressed because the group elected at the public meeting had never issued a final report and some of them had not been informed that the group was being disbanded and a PCCC possibly formed. Inspector Langmead has agreed to set a date for the final meeting of that group, probably in late August, and then to write an open letter to the media. He also confirmed that Burra is officially still a three person station, though it only had two officers at present. Staffing is being reviewed across the state. He thought it was now time to close the issue and move on and the PCCC was a way to do that.</p>

<p>Goyder Council</p>
<p>On Monday Hallett community members and a large contingent of Robertstown residents attended Council to ask that the decision to close Council offices at Hallett and Robertstown be rescinded. They addressed the Council and presented a petition. They argued a lack of consultation and the need to promote stronger links with the community. It was said the Robertstown office needs to be retained, bearing in mind its service to elderly people, the library service in the building and the various uses made of the rear of the building, such as for meetings and art and craft displays. More than 80% of the town’s population signed the petition.</p>
<p>Peter Rankin, for Hallett, said the Hallett CMC refused to represent the community on the issue. Hallett had lost the Council Works Depot and the district clerk had moved to Burra. As a consequence the Post Office had lost its biggest customer and was of questionable viability. Assessed values of houses in Hallett were now totally unrealistic, as services decline.</p>
<p>A move by Cr Mosey to revoke the motion that the offices be closed was ruled invalid, when CEO Steve Kerrigan pointed out it could not proceed before the next Council elections. Cr Don Pfitzner then moved the original motion be deferred pending further discussions.</p>
<p>[The outcome of that motion is not reported.]</p>

<p>Redfire Resources in their last quantity report said the Burra Project consisted of two exploration licences covering more than 1,000 km2 around the Burra Mine and the Mongolata Goldfield. The Burra Mine [in the 1970s] was an oxide copper deposit that produced 2.7 million tonnes of ore averaging 3% copper. Past exploration concentrated on copper outcrops south of the town. To the north the prospective zones are covered by alluvium for some 15 km and this is where Redfire has been looking. 243 surface soil samples have been taken. Anomalous copper values have been found extending for 700 m and 100 m to 300 m in width, were found1.5 km and 4 km north of the old mine. Redfire has confirmed that the mineralising system extends to the north of the old mine. At Mongolata anomalous gold values have been found north of the goldfield.</p>

<p>Discussions included:</p>
<p>Onion wed control</p>
<p>Grazing management</p>
<p>Land rehabilitation and revegetation</p>
<p>There were workshops and demonstrations.</p>
<p>Ray O’Malley of Mallee Treeplanting Services of Karoonda, spoke on the use of seedlings to stabilise planned and prepared sites quickly, with their ability to compete with weeds.</p>
<p>Dudley Cockington spoke of the decline in Blackoak and Sugarwood species due to slow regeneration. Here management of total grazing by sheep, cattle, goats, kangaroos and rabbits was the key issue.</p>
<p>Establishing watering points away from permanent water to allow stock to spread out, but without increasing overall stocking rates would enable young plants to survive. Other ideas were to improve sheep productivity to allow a reduction in stocking rates for the same return. [Other ideas are reported.]</p>
<p>The Natural Heritage Trust will be asked for further funding to revegetate the Hallett-Terowie rail corridor. 71⁄2 km of direct seeding was done last week.</p>

<p>Edith Pearce was born 91 years ago at Gladstone and later moved to Clare with her parents, older sister and brother, where they lived for some time. When her father retired from farming they moved to the Unley area of Adelaide and she attended Unley High School, though she always said she was supposed to go to nearby Methodist Ladies College as a weekly boarder &ldquo;to learn manners&rdquo;, but she had refused the offer. However she had no hesitation in sending her own two daughters there, so we trust that she was reasonably pleased with the end results!</p>
<p>Her maternal great grandparents, the Francis Pascoes and their children had come to Burra from Cornwall in I848 and first lived in a dug-out in the creek. Her grandparents lived in the Clare area where they took up land and one of their 17 children, Elizabeth would become her mother.</p>
<p>She had many fascinating memories - of sitting around the kitchen table aged nearly five and listening to the grownups reading aloud from the newspapers about the sinking of the Titanic; of proudly sitting up in the back of her father&rsquo;s first car, the one with the number 3320 (still on the family cars) as they drove through Clare, hoping that everyone would notice her. She concluded that very few did - even if cars were still a novelty over 80 years ago. She was also quite proud of the fact that she saw Halley&rsquo;s Comet twice in her life-time. She opted to go to a Sunday School picnic rather than going to hear Dame Nellie Melba sing and also recalled walking about on one half constructed end of the Harbour Bridge during a trip to Sydney. She enjoyed going to Test Cricket matches and saw Bradman play in Adelaide.</p>
<p>She loved all animals, particularly cats and was famous for giving the many creatures in the family menagerie wonderful and appropriate names The Methodist Church and a long Methodist heritage played a large part in her religious and social life over many years and it was through one of her church’s ministers, the Reverend E.</p>
<p>H. Woollacott, that she met his youngest brother, Stanley, also from a Burra family of long-standing, who was ten years her senior in age. After a long engagement, due to the fact that both had ageing parents to care for, the couple married in 1944 and came to live in the Smelts Road home which would become a happy, spacious and secure haven in which to raise us. She was a wonderful, encouraging mother and a devoted and supportive wife. She spent a number of quite difficult years caring for Dad at home before he needed permanent hospitalisation.</p>
<p>In later years after the sale of the family’s farming and grazing land, travel became one of life’s pleasures and the fact that as a fami1y, we travelled around the world together during most of 1970s set the scene for many other trips by each of us. to various parts of Australia and the globe She made her last overseas trip at the age of 85, made all the more memorable for aging her elder daughter by some 100 years when she got lost in Singapore’s massive Changi Airport for an hour!</p>
<p>She was very well read, loved music, especially that termed Classical, and passed those loves on to us from an early age by constantly reading to us and introducing us to music, although our piano lessons didn’t bear much fruit!</p>
<p>Her wonderful sense of humour still surfaced even in quite recent times when there wasn’t a great deal to laugh about. She had a great general knowledge and could answer a variety of Sale of the Century quiz questions with ease. Her witty comments and sense of humour were almost legendary within the family even when age began to tell on her memory.</p>
<p>Perhaps owing to having lived through the Great Depression she liked to put things away in case they would come in useful “for school projects” or for “a rainy day”. A large house made this habit a very easy one to nurture and judging by what she managed to keep for the projects and the rainy day, we can expect floods sometime in the near future!</p>
<p>Her life span of 91 years saw remarkable changes to the world into which she was born. Those years have seen a range of monarchs, governments, World Wars, and great social changes. She happily embraced many of those changes which have ranged from the Edison waxed cylinders to compact discs and computers, from horse-drawn vehicles and primitive bi-planes to Jumbo Jets and manned space flights. Her era spanned times of financial uncertainty to comfortable affluence for main people. Through these nine decades she maintained a cheerful nature and disposition and even in the last few years when her quality of life declined markedly she rarely if ever complained and was polite to the end. That she was still able to be in Burra and in our excellent Hospital, with its caring staff, would have meant a great deal to her.</p>
<p>Her death last Sunday morning came as a relief from the burden of a heavy load and we commend her to</p>
<p>God’s loving care.</p>
<p>Throughout her long life, she never lost her faith in His goodness. We will constantly remember her for the wonderful person that she was and are grateful to be able to say that we are her daughters.</p>

<p>National Threatened Species Day is celebrated on 7 September – the anniversary of the day the last Tasmanian tiger died.</p>
<p>In SA the 4th National Day in 1998 will focus on the Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard. Following its rediscovery in 1992, inside a dead brown snake, after an absence of 30 years, a search has revealed ten small populations, with numbers now estimated at 5,500. They live in trapdoor wolf spider holes and can live for at least eight years in the wild. A public talk on the species will be held in Burra on 23 September.</p>

<p>Burra Cycling Classic was held over the weekend of 12-13 September. The main race was on Saturday over 125 km and on Sunday a series of scratch events were held from Leighton Cricket club to Mt Bryan and back. John Stafford, who won the event in 1948 (aged 17) started the Saturday race. In 1948 it started in King William Street, Adelaide, by the City Baths and finished in Burra, 120 miles later, having criss-crossed the country through Kapunda, Marrabel and Clare. One of John’s riding mates, John McIntosh (‘Blue’) was also in Burra for the weekend. The three big races of the time were Burra to Adelaide, the Mt Gambier 100 and the Warrnambool to Melbourne. Other local names of that time were Sid and Eric Scroop, Donny Kerin, Rex Opperman and the two Garrard boys. [Photo of John with Don Lloyd.]</p>

This has taken some time because it was not originally known that the Native Vegetation Act applied to the grassland to be disturbed – then rip lines had to be pre-marked so that they could be checked for pygmy bluetongue presence. (None was found.) [Further detail is provided.]</p>

<p>The Great SA Bike Ride brought 450 visitors to Burra on Monday afternoon, after a fairly hot ride from Eudunda. After settling in at Burra Oval many returned to Market Square for food and live music. ‘Breaker Morant’ was screened at the Redruth Gaol in the evening – where some of its scenes were shot. Most riders were off to Clare before 9 a.m. on Tuesday, to try to escape the heat. The riders came with a vast support network of at least three semi-trailers, two covered trucks, vans with toolboxes and repair kits etc. and a travelling café. Overnight the oval was covered with pup tents.</p>

<p>Accident/Obituary. Two well-known Mid North identities died last week. Collinsville studmaster Wal Hennessy and Jamestown businessman Ross Downing were killed when a light aircraft in which they were travelling crashed on Kilfera Station, south of Ivanhoe on Wednesday. They were attending a field day. It is alleged the plane veered to avoid powerlines, but clipped a radio tower and hit the roof of an old homestead, before bursting into flames. Wal Hennessy was a leading Merino expert and had been studmaster at Collinsville since its purchase by Paddy Handbury in 1994. He is survived by his wife, Ann and three children. Ross Downing was known for his transport and contracting business.</p>
<p>Burra Ambulance Centre is being renovated and the ambulance bays and training room are both being enlarged by 3 m. This will allow easy access to vehicles for cleaning and restocking and a safer working environment. The construction is by local builders D.T.

In the meantime thanks are due to Howard Matson for allowing the use of the shed at his home to house the ambulances.</p>

<p>The 4th Annual National Threatened Species Day saw a focus in SA on the Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard. Once common through the northern Mt Lofty Ranges and into the Adelaide area, it had been thought extinct until rediscovered in 1992 after an absence of 30 years. Searchers have now identified a number of sites and they are estimated now to number c. 5,500. They are found only in temperate native grasslands of SA’s Mid North. At a public meeting in Burra on 23 September speakers were Sylvia Clark, Project Officer and Dr Mark Hutchinson, Curator of Reptiles at the SA Museum. They also spoke the following day at BCS.</p>

<p>It has been agreed to hold three athletic meets with the first on 19 October at the bottom oval, after which an attempt will be made to form a committee. [The implication seems to be that if a committee does not come forward then, the club would cease.]</p>
<p>The Old Mine Store</p>
<p>Conservation work is currently being carried out at the old Mine Store – John Carpenter’s property. A conservation study was done on the store and yard, built in 1847, a couple of years ago, with funds from the National Estate Program. Conservation work was then earmarked as urgent and a second grant is now seeing this done. The building once housed offices, stores and a storeman’s residence and had an adjoining spacious yard surrounded by a high wall. It was a depot for building materials, iron, tools and mining machinery of the SAMA. Along with the powder magazine, it is believed to be the oldest remaining mine building in Australia.</p>

<p>Goyder Council &amp; BCS have expressed concern at the delay in the construction of Burra’s mobile phone tower. The proposal has the support of the local community and the State heritage Branch and is currently being assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission, which has asked for more detail. The Commission is seeking to know its impact on each of 39 individual heritage items in the town, listed separately on the National Estate Register. It also wants information on what steps Telstra will be taking to minimise the impact of the common service trench on any archaeological, bio-diversity and heritage issues. Goyder Council considers all this has been covered by the State Heritage Assessment and the repeat process is a waste of time and money, causing needless delay. The Commission has also requested information on alternative sites and photographs with greater clarity of the hillscape and skyline and thinks Telstra should seek the advice of an architectural archaeologist and expert on biodiversity.</p>

<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery held its AGM on 22 November.</p>
<p>Chairman Peter Harvey’s Report</p>
<p>The Board’s aim has been to develop a strategy to meet the objects and purposes in the constitution; to create a community-based facility that will play a significant part in Burra events and tourism, while creating a focus for art development in the region – which will include bringing to the gallery as many interesting and stimulating shows as we can afford.</p>
<p>Attendance for the year was 3,261, which compares well with other country galleries. In NSW and Victoria, as well as three other regional galleries in SA, the funding comes through Councils, State Government and benefactors. Burra is the only regional gallery in SA without paid staff. We must therefore be all the more appreciative of the work of our volunteers and especially of curatrs like Susan Roche, Mary Woollacott and Hazel Newcombe. The volunteer guides are also vital to keep the gallery open seven days a week for most of the year. The Board will continue to pursue funding options. The Leonard Bence Retrospective attracted 1,600 visitors.</p>
<p>Elected: Chairman, Peter Harvey; Secretary, Colin Endean and Treasurer, Val Rivers.</p>

<p>BCS held a 120/20 Concert in the Burra Town Hall last Thursday and Friday to celebrate the school’s 120th anniversary and the Community Library’s 20th birthday. There were full houses for a program that spanned the 120 years, with items from Gilbert &amp; Sullivan to the Roaring 20s, the Rocky Horror Show and the Spice Girls. The school was opened on 25 January 1978, with an enrolment of 420, though average attendance in the first year was below 300.</p>

<p>[No. This is an error. The mine closed 29 September 1877.]</p>

<p>Botanists Ann Prescott &amp; Millie Nicholls led a group enthusiasts around the Mine Hill on the evening of 10 November in drizzling rain and low temperatures to see a wonderland of plants. Twenty-five species were gathered in a short time. Ann estimates c. 50 perennial species are in the area. The hill is one of the few places in the Mid North where there are native grasses in such profusion and in such good condition. Native grasslands covered much of the Mid North area from Crystal Brook to Clare, but most have been cultivated or grazed.</p>

<p>The Burra Motor Co. has changed hands.</p>
<p>Dollman’s Burra Motor Co. has been operated by three generations of the Dollman family and the new owners are Neil &amp; Angie and David &amp; Libby Webster. Guy Dollman Snr came to Burra with his family from Wilcannia in 1923 and established the Burra Motor Co. alongside the Commercial Hotel. He moved to the present site in the late 1930s. Originally the present site had an ice works and Luke Day, a Chinese storekeeper and greengrocer had his shop on the corner. The Burra Motor Co. was a thriving business with 15 employees at one time and was an independent petrol retailer, selling brands such as Caltex, Golden Fleece, Neptune, Shell, Vaccuum and Ampol. John Nankivell can recall the old hand-pumped petrol bowsers, where a certain volume was pumped into a large glass measure on top of the bowser and was then gravity fed into the cars. John worked there for some 22 years, starting in 1948 and the late Jeff Neale also worked there for many years. Dollmans had the franchise for Vanguard cars and also for Hillman, Dodge and Chrysler at different times. Jim Richards started work there in 1950 and worked for Dollmans for 13 years, ten as foreman. Guy Dollman Snr died in 1967 and Guy Jnr and his wife Dawn then ran the business. Guy Jnr died in 1993, after which his son Richard continued in partnership with his mother.</p>
<p>The interior was modernised in 1993 at the suggestion of Connie Hallion.</p>
<p>It is believed there have been two fires on the site over the last 75 years – one when Luke Day was there.*</p>
<p>Richard Dollman also recalls that when floodwaters swept down Commercial Street they had either to sandbag the premises or sweep water out of it. [3 photos.]</p>
<p>[*There is a report of a fire in Luke Day’s shop in the Burra Record of 30 September 1914, page 3, which seems to have been a fairly minor event. The fire in Wright’s Motors is reported in the Burra Record of 19 November 1930, page 3 and was a much more serious affair.]</p>

This superb effort to celebrate the 120th birthday of public education in Burra and 20 years of the Community School was a great achievement of the students. Year 11 students did the research to establish information about each decade, which was then written into a script to be read out by the Year 10 &amp; 11 presenters on the night. Students from R to year 9 learnt the songs and dances to be performed. The effort involved all the school’s 270 students apart from Year 12, the staff and a host of parents as well as the group Triomore.</p>

<p>A free Bushcare Workshop has been organised at Mt Bryan by the Nature Conservation Society, Trees for Life and greening Australia. These series of workshops across SA are particularly aimed at community groups interested in conserving and maintaining native vegetation.</p>
<p>Previous to European settlement extensive areas of the plains and low hills in the Mid North from Clare to Peterborough were devoid of trees and shrubs. They were Temperate Native Grasslands dominated by native grasses and herbs such as lilies and daisies. Less than one percent of these areas survive and most of the survivors are heavily infested with weeds. The remnants are important habitats for rare and endangered species. The workshop will consist of a slide show and talk by botanist Rick Davies and zoologist Tim Milne. Rick has done extensive work on weed control in native grasslands and Tim is doing a PHD study on the endangered Pygmy Blue Tongued Lizard. The talk at Mt Bryan Hall 9 a.m. Tuesday 2 February will be followed by an afternoon visit to the newly acquired grassland area at Mount Cone, which is to become a conservation park. It contains some of the best surviving areas of remnant grassland.</p>

<p>Goyder Council will close its Hallett Office from 1 February. This has followed the general request of Hallett residents, who wish to utilise the building for other community activities. Lachie Gosse, Chairman of the Hallett Community Management Committee, said the committee’s decision was unanimous. In future dog licence payments, rates etc. can be paid at the Post Office, which is open five days a week, rather than at the Council office, which was open only one day a week. Tammy Liebhardt, who has staffed the Hallett Office on Fridays, will continue to work at the Burra Office.</p>

<p>Obituary. An editorial comments on the contribution of the recently deceased Don Dunstan to the life of SA.</p>

<p>Burra Silo Committee held a post-harvest meeting. Recently the railway line past the cells has been covered with gravel, allowing B-double road trains to load grain without unhooking. A proposed change at the silos was to build a chute from a cell to the outloader chute, which would enable the silo to receive and also operate the outloader at the same time. This would cost in the vicinity of $35,000 and may be budgeted for in the next year.</p>
<p>[Note that this report confirms the effective closure of the Burra railway line. A grain train was reported for January 1999 and the above confirms that rail access to the silos was then terminated. No passenger trains had used the line since the Australian Railway Historical Society’s special on 19 September 1992. The last regular passenger train was on 13 December 1986.]</p>

<p>J. R. Langmead, Chief Inspector &amp; Officer in Charge North East Local Service Area, writes an open letter to the Burra Community.</p>
<p>In December 1997, a public meeting was held in the Burra Town Hall to address complaints that had been received from members of the community concerning the way in which the town and district was being policed. At the meeting a committee was appointed to work with senior police to overview the investigation of the complaints. This letter honours a commitment to keep the public informed of the results. Senior staff from the Police Internal Investigation Branch spoke to 17 people who had lodged individual complaints and to three others who wished to air their concerns. None of the complaints involved serious misconduct, but rather revolved around how police dealt with members of the public. All complainants have agreed to have their complaints resolved informally, allowing police the deal with maters raised as issues of management. At the end of the investigation the Police Complaints authority wrote to each complainant advising them that matters had been resolved and the investigation was complete. Some of the problems raised are being addressed in the ‘Country Policing Review. While acknowledging there were certain problems, it is important to note that in the past Burra police have enjoyed very positive working relationships with their police. In a recent survey over 400 randomly selected households were asked about community attitudes towards police. Just less than 50% replied and 86.6% of those who did so were either satisfied or very satisfied. This is well above the state average of 77.6% and the national average of 78.8%. It reflects intensive work done since that public meeting nearly 12 months ago. The first meeting of the recently formed Police Community Consultative Committee was well attended and details of this committee and its aims will be published in due course. The original committee appointed at the public meeting has been very diligent in seeing that the Burra community has not been disadvantaged in any way. They have had numerous meetings with senior Police officers to discuss the progress of the investigations and I acknowledge the role they have played in addressing and resolving the issues raised.</p>

<p>Burra Golf Club. A retaining wall has been built around the number one tee block to make a feature of the clubhouse. Last week Jack McMahon and a team of club members sowed the fairways. The sanding of the greens and the hours spent by club members working on tee blocks is bringing the project near completion. It is hoped to be able to open the course on the Easter Weekend with an official opening on the long weekend in May. It is hoped this year to increase membership to 100 full members.</p>

<p>Profile by Rosemary Opperman</p>
<p>I am married to Peter and with our sons Matthew (21) and Michael (18) we own and operate Oppy’s Burra Foodtown. I enjoy cooking, gardening, and watching telly in my spare time. I was born at the Burra Hospital in 1955 and educated at Burra Primary &amp; High Schools. On leaving school I worked for Bence’s until I married in 1974. I joined the Ambulance Service in 1981after doing a First Aid Course and then became a Volunteer Ambulance Officer. In 1997 I was proud to be named Burra Citizen of the Year for my work in the ambulance Service and felt the award was received on behalf of all members of the station. I have been Team Leader at Burra for 13 years, overseeing the daily operations of the service. Being a member for 18 years has been a most rewarding experience.</p>

<p>How much more should be spent on improvements when other facilities are available in Burra?</p>
<p>Routine maintenance exceeds income, so how can usage and hire be increased to cover maintenance costs?</p>
<p>Is there a group interested in managing the building?</p>
<p>Is the community interested in the future use of the hall?</p>

<p>SA Ambulance Service Recruitment Drive</p>
<p>Profile of Nigel Winzar</p>
<p>I am 51 years old, married with two young children at school. I joined the Ambulance Service four years ago to do a bit more for the community, but also to gain skills that could aid my own family if sick or injured. In the past not knowing what to do when faced with a sick or injured child was a real fear. Now I have that knowledge and training. My commitment is one night a week training and being on call for a few shifts each month – depending on work and family commitments. Being on call still allows me to do most things – gardening, visiting friends or cleaning out the shed – as long as I stay within the town. The number of Ambulance Officers is low at present and new recruits are needed to help share the workload.</p>

<p>Profile of Garry &amp; Jenny Gebhardt (by Jenny)</p>
<p>We were married in 1988 and have three children, Kirsty (10), Justin (9) and Jason (3). Garry works in Clare as store manager for McLeod’s Tyres. Our interests include cooking, boating, gardening and camping. Garry was born and raised in Burra and I was born in Clare and spent most of my life in Yacka. We moved back to Burra in 1995. We joined the Ambulance Service in 1997 and find that as a couple it works well, being able to cover each other’s roster if necessary and the other is able to look after the children. Garry is able to work one or two days a week for the Clare Ambulance Service, who are also stretched for their daytime roster. It has given both of us the confidence to deal with situations where once we would not have known what to do.</p>

<p>Mt Cone near Burra has recently been purchased for the National Park Reserve system. It is the first grassland reserve in the state and protects 465 ha of native grassland with the major plant association being Lomandra multiflora var. dura green tussock grassland. Open tussock grasslands are rare and endangered in SA. This reserve is on relatively flat ground on heavy soils. Over 95% of grasslands have been cleared and it is almost 100% on flat land – most remnants being on slopes too steep for agriculture and have been affected by grazing, fertilizing and introduced species. Mt Cone has been grazed, but has a history of low stocking rates and low fertilizer application. (Ann Prescott.)</p>

There are blue tongue lizards in the area and their safety will be addressed. Digital towers are already operating at Black Springs, Peter’s Hill and Hallett. John Cuffley said there were no immediate plans to install CDMA technology, but it could be looked at. The nearest CDMA connection for now would be at Clare.</p>
<p>Accident. On Sunday morning 12 April a B-double truck rolled over c. 4 km north of Hallett on the Barrier Highway, loaded with 100 head of cattle.

Hallett SES and Hallett &amp; Whyte Yarcowie CFS attended. 24 of the cattle had to be destroyed and five more are to be assessed for injury.</p>

<p>Gail Edwards profile.</p>
<p>We returned from travelling around Australia to live in Burra 9 years ago with two teenage children. I knew my greatest commitment was to the church, but also wanted to give something to the community and so responded to a call to join the Ambulance Service with some trepidation. After training I felt terror at my first call-out – as it happened there was one at 7.30 a.m., another at 9.30 a.m. (a trip to Adelaide) and a third at 4 p.m. At present my time is divided between the Ambulance Service and my role as First Aid Instructor with St John. At times it has been difficult to give as much as I would have liked, but I have never been disappointed with the decision I made to join.

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>The public meeting to discuss the future of the Town Hall was well attended last week. The meeting endorsed the idea of the hall remaining primarily a community facility. It was pointed out that Burra had other facilities that were also used by the community and the hall needed to be used to be financially viable and the use would have to be extended with perhaps more concerts, film shows and craft fairs. Perhaps it could accommodate an ‘internet café’ and conferences were another possibility. For that though, it would have to be upgraded. The new Council had taken over the Civic Centre for office space, effectively removing from Burra one facility and so it was said the Council had a responsibility for the loss of amenities the community used to enjoy at the Civic Centre. An interim steering committee was established.</p>
<p>The Rostrum Voice of Youth public speaking contest was held at Burra Community School on Thursday 29th April. This year all the competitors were female. Burra Penguin Club hosted the evening.

<p>Early last year the western side of the golf course was closed for the greening program and at the end of last August the course was closed and the whole of the course was redesigned. The old blacks were removed and the new greens formed and planted. Darryl Venning, Club President, announced the new course would be officially opened on 16 May at 3 p.m. He thanked the many people who had helped to make the transformation possible – some with heavy machinery plant and vehicles and other with stone picking, raking and smoothing the greens ready for seeding. A former green-keeper from Eyre Peninsula played the course last week and said it was an amazing result. The opening weekend will see three days of golf – a Stableford competition – men’s and ladies’ on Saturday, a mixed Ambrose on Sunday before the official opening and a mixed 4 BBB Stableford on Monday.</p>

<p>Burra Golf Club</p>
<p>A crowd in excess of 150 attended the official opening of the redeveloped course on Sunday 16 May. President Darryl Venning welcomed everyone and described the greening of the course as the most exciting event in the club’s history. A huge amount of work had gone into excavating the dam and getting the water to the dam and greens and then the laying of the sprinklers and wiring for the computerisation of the scheme. Then there was the development of the greens themselves. He thanked the professionals involved:</p>
<p>Kym Traeger, the designer</p>
<p>Craig Wilson from the Mid North Regional Development Board</p>
<p>Peter Boaden from Goyder Council</p>
<p>Simon Kibble from Adchem</p>
<p>And the many sponsors.</p>
<p>Denis Keller, Chairman of the Regional Council of Goyder congratulated the club on the project, which had made the course a further attraction for Burra and added to its appeal as a visitor destination. He outlined the project’s history:</p>
<p>In 1996 the Burra Burra DC was approached and it commended the project to the new Regional Council for consideration in 1997.</p>
<p>After further planning and fine tuning it was referred to the Regional Council in November 1997 and got unanimous support.</p>
<p>A loan of $175,000 was arranged with a donation of $50,000 to be given as $10,000 per annum for five years.</p>
<p>Guarantors of the loan were sought in August 1998 and the community strongly supported it.</p>
<p>In all the project came in at just over $200,000, with $30,000 being donated in volunteer work.</p>
<p>Other speakers congratulated the club:</p>
<p>President of WGSA Den Michelmore</p>
<p>Vice-President of SAGA Malcolm Jones</p>
<p>Warren Mosey of the Lower North Group</p>
<p>Di Day as Secretary of Burra Golf Club</p>
<p>The ribbon was then cut by Denis Keller and last year’s champions Lesley Gosse and Gus Wenzel hit the first balls off the first tee.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital is presently receiving strong community support to fund electric beds. So far Burra has received funding for nine electric beds at a cost of $2,200 per bed. The Burra Ladies’ Auxiliary has funded four. Mr &amp; Mrs Cliff Lucas funded three and the CWA and the Op Shop one each. Electric beds are not only more comfortable for patients, but make life easier for staff, reducing the risk of strain injuries.</p>

<p>Ovine Johne’s Disease was found on the Woollana Stud near Mt Bryan last week. Rob Ashby, Chairman of the SA Sheep Advisory Group says sheep men should still have a reasonable degree of confidence about continuing to buy stud merino rams from the Mid North. The testing that has been done means there is a better chance of buying disease free animals from the Mid North than from any other area in Australia. Most studs have been voluntarily tested and all have been accredited as having achieved MN1 status - the best assurance sheep breeders can get. Buying from an untested flock carries a much greater risk, he said. The ‘Woollana’ case was discovered during a routine post mortem, which is part of the accreditation process. Woollana has been quarantined with sheep only allowed to be sold for slaughter. The disease does not spread easily or rapidly. Flocks across the state will now be tested. If incidence turns out to be low an eradication program is then the likely response. If it turned out to be widespread then a control program may be the best option.</p>

<p>The Telstra mobile phone tower became operational at c. 4.30 p.m. Tuesday 29 June. It was in November 1997 that Telstra confirmed it would build the tower on land leased from BCS on Brewery Hill – then came consultation with the community, planning and heritage approval. In April 1998 Telstra said it would cover 99% of the town, but one or two dead spots were possible. In October 1998 the Council and the school both expressed concern over the delays, when the application at that time was with Environment Australia in Canberra. Eventually there was news that the project would start in early 1999. It was still mid-April before a group braved the strong wind on the site to hear that work would begin immediately. Other towers have been built at Black Springs and Hallett.</p>

<p>Swimming Pools</p>
<p>Goyder Council has recently done a study of the three pools it owns at Burra Eudunda and Hallett.</p>
<p>The Eudunda pool and wading pool is the oldest.</p>
<p>The Burra pool and wading pool is less than ten years old and is at BCS under a joint use agreement with the Education Department, though this agreement, which involves the transfer of the land to the Council, has not been signed, despite repeated attempts to do so. Council has now sought the aid of Hon. Graham Gunn MP to have this done.</p>
<p>Hallett pool is less than ten years old and shares toilets, a power supply and bore, which is located on Hallett Primary School grounds, under an agreement that is no longer in effect since the closure of the school and the Council should seek an agreement with the owner, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. It was so moved at the last Council meeting and also that the existing Eudunda ablutions and change room structure be replaced by 30 June 2004 and that an ablution and change room structure be built by that date at Burra to allow that pool to act as an independent structure by 30 June 2004. Council is currently formalising a lease of the Eudunda Pool to the Eudunda Amateur Swimming Club Inc. The report recommends this type of arrangement be made with the other pools by 30 June 2000.</p>

<p>Burra Tyres</p>
<p>From 1 July Russell and Lisa Murphy (nee Smedley) have taken over the business from Ron and Geraldine Smedley. Lisa’s father, Ron took over the business from Jennisons some 15 years ago and Russell has been working there for almost three years. Ron says the family tradition of dedicated service will continue. The site of the business in Commercial Street has long been a part of Burra’s commercial landscape. Mr Horton Jennison started here in 1922 as a BMC dealer and tyre repairer and vulcaniser. Passenger car tyres were retreaded on site for many years until the process was made uneconomic by the multiplicity of sizes and treads. The retreading plant was sold in the late 1950s. Ray Jennison joined the business in 1956 and Jennison’s Tyre Service expanded and thrived, employing at one time twelve people. A fire in 1985 severely damaged the premises and later that year the Burra Tyres section of the business was sold to Ron and Geraldine Smedley. Frank Fennell was a long-time employee from 1960 into the Smedley era for some years.</p>

<p>Burra Picnic Race Club held its AGM on 6 July. Retiring President John Oates said that although numbers attending were slightly down on 1998, this year’s race day was successful and the gymkhana events were very well patronised and the sleepy lizard derby created a lot of fun. The new shelter for barbecue caterers by Bob and Reva Cullen was a real asset. The increase of $1,300 in the bank account compared with this time last year will allow donations to the Kidney Foundation and local clubs. Elected: President, C. Taylor; Vice-President, A. Moore; Secretary, Reva Cullen &amp; Treasurer, Barb Nesbitt.</p>

<p>Burra Cemetery. On 16 July the main gates to the walled section of the cemetery were rehung. The gates date back to 1854, when the cemetery was walled to keep out foraging stock and stray animals. At some unknown time the gates went missing and one was found in 1993 at the Bon Accord Museum. Skillshare at Clare was contacted and a matching gate was made. Since a conservation study of the cemetery was carried out in 1992 much restoration work has been done. Most of the remaining headstones from the cleared area, which were leaning against the western wall, have now been re-sited to the cleared area and many broken or damaged headstones have been repaired. Chairman of the Cemetery Committee is Kevin Wallis of Mongolata Gold.</p>

<p>The South Australian Underwater Training School has been granted access to the Burra Mine Pool as a fresh water training facility for scuba divers. Martin Phillips from the school described the Mine Pool as offering the perfect venue. The school is required to give students a wide range of diving conditions and needs a safe 30 m-plus fresh water diving location. They have been searching for one for some time. A sink hole in the South East has been used, but authorities have deemed it too small. The courses run for about eight days four times a year. This is a very passive use for the pool that fits well within heritage guidelines. This is the only commercial underwater training school operating in SA and one of only six in Australia.</p>

<p>Partnerships 21</p>
<p>This article outlined the opportunities presented by entering into this new method of local management for schools, children’s services and TAFE Institutions. It outlined objections to the model voiced by the Australian Education Union. Their legal advice was that it was a risky thing to sign up to because, although it was legally binding, it was unspecific and did not meet the obligations of due diligence. Funding over the three years of the service agreement was uncertain and didn’t take into account that all schools were struggling with their budgets due to reductions in funding since 1993.

<p>Burra Branch of the National Trust held its AGM last Friday. Special guests were the new Director of the Trust, Reiner Jozeps; and from Central Deborah Bendigo the President/Director, Dennis O’Hoy and the General Manager, James Thompson.</p>
<p>Mr Jozeps said there were 50 National Trust branches in the state and 280 sites in Australia, of which 148 were in SA.</p>
<p>Dennis O’Hoy, who is descended from a Chinese family that came to Bendigo in the gold rush days, gave a talk on the work of the Central Deborah and illustrated it with slides.</p>
<p>James Thompson gave a talk on the business side of the Central Deborah operations in Bendigo.</p>
<p>President of the Burra Branch, Maureen Wright, gave her annual report. It is now two years since the branch decided to become more involved in tourism in Burra by leasing the remaining Burra Passport sites from the (then) District Council and taking over the management of Morphett’s Engine House and the Burra Visitor Centre. Since then volunteers have put in a wonderful effort as site managers and on the executive. Some members have taken on paid jobs, giving more time than they are paid for.</p>
<p>1997/98 was a financial burden for the branch, but one for which it had planned. The last year has seen a turn-around in finances with all sites making a special effort to curb expenditure and with the Visitor Centre performing well. Thanks go to Manager Janelle Cousins. The trust has developed a good working relationship with the Goyder Council and other community bodies. The membership list of about 70 is an indication of our support.</p>
<p>In the future the branch and town will become involved with Flinders University through the school of Archaeology and Cultural Tourism and a professional diving school will be using the Mine Pool for training. There will also be Trust involvement in celebrations for the Centenary of Federation and d the Festival of Arts Regional Events program.</p>

<p>Kooringa Bible Christian Chapel will be 150 years old on 5 December. The congregation for this chapel formed largely as the result of the work of James Blatchford, a Cornish miner and lay preacher who arrived in the colony in 1847. He and three other lay preachers, John Halse, and brothers John &amp; Thomas Pellew had a passion to gather together members belonging to the Bible Christian Church in Cornwall to be a witness in their new home. They formed the first Bible Christian congregation outside of Cornwall. This group of about 49 members applied to the SA Mining Association in 1849 for some land and received a piece on the southwest corner of Paxton Square, where it began to erect a new chapel. It was completed in March 1850 and James Blatchford preached the first sermon. In April 1850 Revs James Way and James Rowe arrived to lead the church through a period of rapid growth. Very soon they outgrew the chapel and built another south along Bridge Terrace. The original chapel was the first of some 500 Bible Christian Chapels across Australia. In 1900 the Bible Christians united with the Primitive Methodists and the Wesleyans to form the Methodist Church. This in turn became part of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977.</p>

<p>Burra Heavy Vehicle By-Pass</p>
<p>Ron Roberts MLC met with Stephen Kerrigan Goyder, Council CEO; and Peter Boaden, Director of Operations on 8 November to discuss the Councils ongoing problems with maintaining the by-pass road. Currently it is classified as a local road, but received heavy traffic due to signs erected by Transport SA. Maintenance is a heavy burden on the Council, which believes it should be reclassified as a Rural Arterial Road, like the by-passes at Redhill, Snowtown and Crystal Brook. Once reclassified it should be sealed, as it is carrying increased traffic since the sealing of the Morgan Road. Sealing it would also divert much heavy traffic from Market Square. Currently there is a petition circulating asking for the by-pass to be sealed. There is, however, also a petition asking that the sealing of the Kooringa Rd (the extension of Kingston Street) be done before the by-pass. This has been launched by a number of business people who fear the loss of passing trade when the by-pass is sealed.</p>

<p>Bon Accord Mine Buildings are 140 years old this year. It is therefore fitting that National Trust members chose that location for their Christmas get-together last Friday night. The Bon Accord site was originally purchased by speculators from Scotland in 1846. Mining operations went on for three years, but were abandoned in 1849. They were recommenced in 1858, but no ore body was ever found and mining ceased in 1862. Despite the adjacent Monster Mine paying at one stage 800% dividends, the Bon Accord venture was a failure. Some good did come from the enterprise; from 1908-1966* Burra’s town water supply came from the Bon Accord Shaft, before a pipeline from the Morgan-Whyalla pipeline took over.</p>
<p>[Note that these dates are incorrect. From 1878-1908 water for the town was drawn from a shaft on the Bon Accord site that straddled the boundary with Linkson Street. In 1908 operations were shifted to the main shaft and it is this operation that is referred to above.]</p>

<p>Burra Cemetery</p>
<p>Goyder Council in conjunction with the Burra Cemetery Committee and the Heritage Advisory Committee will prepare a plan for the future development and management of the Burra Cemetery.</p>
<p>The older section of the cemetery is well defined by its stone wall, but the two committees felt the new section was ill defined. Also, poor drainage in the new section has been impacting on the stone wall. A plan for the future would address drainage, boundary fencing and landscaping. The future expansion of the cemetery also needed to be addressed. If new land has to be acquired trees should be planted around the perimeter to delineate the area before it starts being used.</p>

<p>Weather</p>
<p>A savage storm smashed into Burra on Wednesday afternoon, 8 December and in just a few minutes, windows and skylights were smashed, premises were flooded and cars were dented in a sudden hailstorm. Foliage was shredded and crops damaged. Afterwards steam billowed from the hot road surfaces. Burra SES and Burra &amp; Mt Bryan CFS responded to calls for help and the MFS was called to Burra Hospital, which had lost many of its windows. The storm crossed the state from Arno Bay on Eyre Peninsula, through the Snowtown area and on to Burra, before crossing the eastern pastoral district. Winds in the Snowtown area were particularly strong – stobie poles were bent and a header was overturned and field bins blown about.</p>
<p>In Burra hailstones reached golf ball size. Broken skylights resulted in flooding at Saltbush Clothing, Décor Made Easy, John Monfries’ office, Day’s Butcher Shop and the Doctor’s Surgery, the Commercial Hotel and the former Joe’s. Elsewhere hail blocked gutters and drains, causing water to enter the Art Gallery and Burra Community Print. The immediate crop damage in SA was put at $2.5 million, but this figure seem sure to rise. An area south and west of Burra seems to have been hard hit. The floodwaters closed the Burra-Robertstown Road until 10 a.m. Wednesday. Floodwaters washed stones across the Burra-Morgan Road for a distance of 15 km from the Robertstown turn-off to near the start of ‘The Gums’ property and these had later to be swept off by workers.</p>
<p>At David &amp; Robyn Nourse’s a large in-ground swimming pool was just being lowered into position as the storm struck. Two men in the hole fled rapidly as the pool was quickly lowered to stabilise the situation.</p>
<p>Sharyn Roberts tried to save her car by driving it into Elders’ merchandise area, but a skylight there fell in and hailstones came through the hole. Damage is assessed at $4,200. Glasshouses at Gerald Pens’ farm were smashed and about 2⁄3 of Thorogood’s apple trees were affected. At the Catholic Church water ran down the hill and spouted from the drain holes in the front wall, almost to the centre of Market Street. At graham &amp; Judy Kellock’s galahs were killed by the hail and magpies were injured. Many cars were dented or lost windscreens. The hail loosened paint from the underside of verandahs in Commercial Street.</p>

<p>Geraldine Smedley has retired after a teaching career of 40 years. She began at Naracoorte in 1959 and then went to Bordertown. She and Ron then headed for Alice Springs, where she joined the Commonwealth Teaching Service for two or three years, before they moved to Burra at the end of 1977. She then did some studying and part-time teaching. From 1980 -89 she taught at Mt Bryan before coming to Burra from 1988-99, with one year (1995) with the School of the Air at Pt Augusta. When she retired from BCS, a garden she and some students began about six years ago was named in her honour. [Photo.]</p>

<p>The Minister for Tourism, Hon Joan Hall will launch the Burra &amp; Beyond 2000 Visitor Guide at the Redruth Gaol on Monday 10 January 2000. It is a 28-page full colour production.</p>
<p>The Page Family will leave Burra in early January.</p>
<p>Robyn says it is 18 years since they came and rented a cottage in Thames Street before buying the Coach House in Ware Street. Some years later they bought Cyril Irlam’s house opposite the Gaol, along with 70 acres and some red deer to run, before finally moving to Paradise. Neil ran his office in Burra for many years and Robyn was appointed to BCS after being with the Regional Education Office in Clare for two years. She did some part-time work when her children were young, before returning to full-time teaching. She made a great contribution to community life. She joined the National Trust in 1982 and was secretary for a number of years – at a time when the Police Lock-up was condemned and the Redruth Gaol was unpainted. The archaeological dig was done on the White Hart Hotel and she and other members dug out cubic metres of pigeon manure from Morphett’s Enginehouse. She also served on the Lewis Board, Burra Mine Museum, and the Burra Tourist Association and was a Councillor for three years and Chairperson for the J150 Committee for five years. She was coach of the netball club and contributed to the School Council’s Curriculum Committee, the Crippled Children’s Association and the Board of the Art Gallery, the Town Hall Steering Committee and the Blue Light Disco Committee. She was also a member of the Jam with Ham Band and has been involved with school musicals. She was chosen Burra’s Australia Day Citizen of the Year in 1995. Neil has been involved in Apex, the Football Club in a number of ways, with tennis, the Burra Traders’ Association and the Tourism Association. He also won the Mail Medal for B Grade football in his playing days.</p>
<p>Their son Lachlan will be going to Scotch College next year after winning a scholarship – he is very interested in a musical career. Kendall will probably attend Burnside Primary School and Robyn has a one-year position at Blair Athol School in Year3-4. Neil will continue his work in estate administration and as a consultant to law firms.</p>

<p>Hi Chick Breeding Site to Go Ahead</p>
<p>Hi Chick Breeding Pty Ltd, a family owned business, is to establish a breeding facility in Burra. Based on land bordered by the Barrier Highway and Springbank Road, it will eventually have five production sheds, a house and amenities block. My next May it is anticipated the house, amenities block and one shed will be operating, with another shed under construction. Pat Hallion of Burra will be the manager. He is currently undergoing training at bethel, the other Hi Chick Breeding Farm. It is anticipated that the operation will employ 10-12 people full-time and perhaps some casuals as well. Mr Jan Meldrum of Hi Chick said locals will be employed wherever possible. He was visiting the site on 21 December with Craig Wilson, CEO of the Mid North Regional Development Board. The area had the necessary facilities; water supply, 3 phase electricity, sufficient isolation from other poultry ventures.</p>
<p>Breeding material is imported from the UK in the form of fertile eggs. They are quarantined on Torrens Island and hatched there. After 12 weeks the chickens are moved. These pedigree chickens will then be taken to Burra and Bethel to provide the genetic material for the production of 27% of the meat chickens in Australia (about 100 million) and for about 4 million layer chickens. Very sophisticated genetic research is done on the breeding farms and the work requires highly specialised training. The company employs its own veterinarian and has a full time animal nutritionist on staff.</p>
<p>The MNRDV will provide funds to subsidise the training of personnel. It was wise for the company to have two sites in the event of an outbreak of an exotic disease. The company had also had a lot of encouragement from the Council. The company was very mindful of the environment. All waste would be removed from the site. Trees would be planted as part of the development. Construction will start about February.</p>

<p>Sealing the Roads</p>
<p>Burra traders Association met with Council representatives on 9 December to discuss sealing the Kooringa Road and the Heavy Vehicle Detour. They spoke in support of their petition calling for the sealing of the Kooringa road to take precedence. Chairman Howard Matson said they had read with some alarm that Council gave the sealing of Kooringa Road a low priority. While the sealing of the Detour would reduce custom for the town, the sealing of Kooringa Road was likely to increase it. Council re-iterated its contention that the detour should be sealed by Transport SA. The Heritage Advisory Committee supported the move to get funding for the sealing of the Detour. At a meeting of Council since 9 December it was resolved to forward a submission to the Local Roads Advisory Committee for the reclassification of the Detour from rural local to rural arterial. Secondly the Director of Operations will investigate the costs of sealing the Kooringa Road, to be considered as part of the Local Road Sealing Priority List.</p>

<p>Aberdeen Croquet Club. From the National Trust Archives by Meredith Satchell.</p>
<p>The club was founded 12 April 1928. Today all that remains is the stone building which once served as club rooms. The Ludgvan Street bypass of the late 1980s cut through the greens, the shelter shed and the adjoining stone wall. The opening of the club took place in February 1929. The club had first looked at various sites, including one near the railway line, but they decided there would be too much dust from the saleyards. The site they chose was previously the home of the Aberdeen Tennis Club. The Tennis Club had moved on to a site adjoining the children’s playground on Smelts Road. Working bees of members’ husbands and sons did much of the hard work in preparing the site. Trees were removed and stone excavated to build a pavilion/clubroom (not the surviving building, which was acquired later). T.H. Woollacott loaned a horse and dray to assist. In November 1928 W.J. Thomas Jnr built the stone walls of the clubroom free of charge and Mr R. Fuss put up the woodwork. Mr R. Steer did the painting. At the opening on 27 February 1929 the President Mrs Emma Sara made a speech and so did Rev. W.O. Harris. The Mayor attended and accepted the deeds to the grounds as a gift to the Council. Council accepted on the condition that the grounds were not used on Sundays. After the Mayor’s speech Cr Woollacott responded and then the Mayoress declared the grounds open. A sumptuous tea followed, accompanied by a number of competitions.</p>
<p>Wilkinson’s the wholesalers of Adelaide had been asked to provide some teacups. They obliged with five dozen teacups labelled ‘Viceroy’ with the stipulation that only ‘Viceroy Tea’ was to be used in them and that any breakages had to be paid for, as they were given on loan. Presumably the survivors of the set are still on loan in their display cabinet in the Market Square Museum.</p>
<p>In 1988 an archaeological study was undertaken on the site of the old White Hart Hotel and in a brief time a 70 page document was produced. The Croquet Club, which was located behind the hotel site, got only a brief mention, along with some photos of the pavilion/clubroom to be demolished as part of the new road scheme. In 1916 the White Hart (of some 22 rooms) was being used as a residence and was owned by Mr James Reed. It was among the oldest buildings in the town, having been erected in 1851. A fire in 1916 created great damage and by 1928 there was little of the building left. In later years this area adjoining the croquet club was cleared up and trees were planted to beautify the ground.</p>
<p>The archaeological survey records many finds from the hotel site and among the other fragments there was a piece of china bearing the word ‘Viceroy’. One cannot but wonder whether in fact this came from a later era that the hotel and instead dates from a time when tea leaves and the odd broken cup were quickly dumped over the wall of the croquet club.</p>
<p>[A list of founding members follows.]</p>
<p>Of course the Aberdeen Croquet Club is not to be confused with the Burra Croquet Club; the two [ends of the town] were quite distinct communities.</p>

<p>Weather. Christmas Day was mild, but in the late afternoon a huge rainstorm delivered up to 150 points in half an hour. The run-off from Brewery Hill was particularly dramatic and washed rocks and considerable mud onto roads. The area around the dugouts was flooded, including some houses. Kerrigan’s received some damage. Eudunda fared far worse with some people reporting falls of 5 to 6 inches. Burra for all of 1999 recorded exactly 400 mm. Since then summer has really arrived with the predicted maximum for today being 40°C.</p>

<p>Floods on Christmas Day caused damage to property and roads. Some Kingston St houses suffered water damage to carpets and a blocked culvert near the dugouts exacerbated problems in that area, causing mud deposits in some places and scouring in others. The Council will seek assistance from the Local Government Disaster Fund for damage done in Burra, Robertstown and especially in Eudunda. [Photo]</p>

<p>Burra Ward Citizen of the Year is Ian Denton of Farrell Flat.</p>
<p>Ian Joseph Denton was born 20 May 1937 and was educated at Farrell Flat School and an Adelaide college. He started working for his father at the family garage 1 July 1954. He soon became involved in the town’s sporting clubs. He is a devoted husband and father of three. His wife Jenny is also a tireless worker for the community, working for the aged and sick in local hospitals and aged homes. Ian’s likely retirement in the near future will be a severe loss for the town.</p>

<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery</p>
<p>The Chairman’s Report 1998-99 is published as a supplement.</p>
<p>The report reflects a successful period of operation. The Chairman strongly believed there was a need for a manager/director and also had hopes for the creation of a community and cultural precinct incorporating the Gallery and the Town Hall, which would offer opportunities for major events with a significant spin-off for the region.</p>
<p>A significant problem for the Gallery was the recurrence of water intrusions into the building on three separate occasions. On one occasion over $800 damage was done to Allyson Parsons prints. Only quick action saved original works on another occasion.</p>
<p>The setting up of the S.T. Gill interpretive elements has been deferred as a result of the shortage of people to manage the Gallery.</p>

<p>The Mid North tourist Assoc. at a meeting in Burra last Thursday debated the need for a change of name for the region. Tourism SA proposed a change from Classic Country to Clare Country. Tourism operators were unhappy with this. A motion was passed to advise the Minister for Tourism that it should be called Clare Valley/Mid North. Recently eight regions were reduced to four [for funding purposes] and this forced the Mid North to be joined with Yorke Peninsula. Classic Country was recently asked to disband as soon as possible by Tourism SA and the MNTA has agreed to this from 30 June 2000 to enable present marketing commitments to be completed. Tourism SA apologised for not sending a representative to the meeting, which consequently was unable to get clarification on some points raised.</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>The Steering Committee has completed a report after several months. The report provides Council with a set of proposals aimed at ensuring the Town Hall remains a vital part of the town’s heritage as well as a being very much a part of the life of the modern community. Vincent Burke, Chairman, said that while it is a proud witness of nineteenth century heritage, the ideas will ensure it remains a lively part of community life in the twenty-first century. Key proposals are:</p>
<p>Upgrade facilities to ensure they are safe, convenient and suitable for all purposes for which the hall has been used, including public performances and entertainment.</p>
<p>Establish monthly film nights.</p>
<p>Develop its potential for small conferences, meetings, seminars and make the Town Hall a focus for promoting Burra as a conference destination, working with other businesses which can provide vital services for such events.</p>
<p>Make a conscious effort to attract weddings to Burra, utilising the Town Hall facilities and the services of other businesses and facilities.</p>
<p>Establish with Federal Government funding a Telecentre or internet Café, for which there was a strong response from the community.</p>
<p>Use this café as a training centre for local community members to learn more about computers and modern technology and information systems.</p>
<p>Establish a Civic History Room reflecting the town’s civic heritage and historic role as capital of the merino industry.</p>
<p>Work closely with the Burra Regional Art gallery to create an exciting cultural precinct.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee has now done its job and has asked the Council to establish a new Town Hall Management Committee to run as a separate incorporated body. Most costs would be met by grants from State and Federal Governments, said Mr Burke.</p>

<p>Flinders University has selected Burra as a prime site for archaeological and cultural tourism research. The project was initiated by Burra Branch of the National Trust and is also supported by the Regional Council of Goyder and the Mid North Regional Development Board. Mr Peter Birt, a graduate researcher, has been given a scholarship for this work and will be based in Burra. Dr Claire Smith of Flinders University will supervise. Initially archaeology will concentrate on the dugouts of Mitchell Flat and will involve both graduate and undergraduate students. Burra has been identified as the most significant colonial town we have and a perfect town to study multiculturalism in Australia. Research on marketing tourism will also be undertaken.</p>
<p>A Chemical Users Course will be offered at Burra 6-7 April by Clare TAFE. In future Edosulfan can only be supplied to persons holding a National Farm Chemical User Certificate or to a licensed spraying contractor.</p>
<p>The Burra Community School Council has mounted a commemorative plaque in the Geraldine Smedley Garden.

<p>Burra Community School Committee AGM was held on Monday when 29 parents and staff attended. David Nourse, as Chairman of the School Council, reported on the year’s highlights. A priority had been to develop Brewery Hill as an educational facility. The Telstra Tower was finally approved and erected. In The Basic Skill Test Burra students had fared very well compared with the rest of the state. The principal, Kevin Fahey, explained that they had decided not to enter into Round One of the Partnerships 21 initiative, but to wait to see what the school would be responsible for with regards to assets and to wait till the present industrial dispute was settled. Student numbers would increase slightly for 2000, but they were on the very edge of losing a teacher granted in 1998. The loss of one student could see a staff member removed.</p>
<p>For 2000 the Council Chairman is David Nourse with Chris Parker as Vice-Chairperson and Roslyn Breeding is Secretary.</p>

<p>Perlite</p>
<p>An application has been made for a perlite expansion facility on the NW outskirts of the town, adjacent to Adchem. The application now goes to the Environmental Protection Agency for assessment. Chillagoe Perlite of Queensland aims to establish the facility to produce perlite wine filtration medium, to replace imported diatomaceous earth, currently in use in Australia. Later its uses could expand to such industries as: edible oils, margarine, breweries, paint, toothpaste, household abrasives, pharmaceuticals and soft drinks. The deposit of perlite in North Queensland is owned jointly by Ian Meyer and Edwin James and is the world’s largest deposit with over 600 million tons of high grade ore. That would keep a factory going for at least a century, if natural gas supplies were available. Local employment would be needed in the construction stage and then production would be in three shifts, each requiring three workers. Local owner-drivers would be needed for deliveries. The ore could be delivered by rail or road transport.</p>

Peter Harvey, a Research Fellow at the University of SA, a National Trust Member and the industry supervisor for the work, said he hoped the study would uncover many aspects of the multicultural community of early Burra where there were people from all parts of the UK, Germany, China, perhaps Chile and other places too. Mr Birt will give a lecture in the Old Courthouse on 9 March. The dig is sponsored by Flinders University, The Goyder Council, The Burra Burra National Trust and the Mid North Regional Development Board and is expected to extend for 2-3 years.</p>

<p>Meredith Satchell writes at length about her project of recording Burra families on a database. Her work to this point has some 14,000 people recorded. Most of the data is drawn from the Index of SA Births 1841-1906, supplemented by records of Births Marriages and deaths for the district, baptismal records, cemetery records and family histories. From this data family history charts can be produced. The database will be of great assistance to both locals and visitors compiling their family trees, and it is available from the Community Library. Along with this basic data come many other stories and family information of interest to researchers. This is very much a work in progress and Meredith encourages people to contact her whether they are seeking information or they are able to add to her ever expanding data.</p>

<p>Burra School won the State Prime Lamb Carcase Competition held at the Karoonda Sheep Fair last weekend. The winning pen was three wethers bred from a White Suffolk ram out of Merino ewes. It was entered in class 3, which was for lambs greater than 23 kg dressed weight. Year 12 students had selected the lambs at the start of the school year. They weighed 53-56 kg on the hoof and 25.2-26 Kg on the hook. The eye muscle scored 24 out of 25 possible points and yield scored 48 out of a possible 50 points. The school wished to acknowledge Bob and Idrienne Neill’s Wheetelande White Suffolk stud at Farrell Flat. A couple of years ago they had given the school the sire and he proved his worth in the competition. The mothers were bought from Stewart Catt of Booborowie as 5.5 y.o. ewes and were of Greenfields blood.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>In recent weeks visitors to Burra have been interviewed by volunteers on behalf of the University of Canberra as part of a survey of three historic mining towns: Burra, Charters Towers and Maldon. When I interviewed Mary Talbot Cross and her husband Roger they wondered why Burra didn’t have a walk of fame. This seems an excellent idea. Brass plates could be placed in the footpath at intervals acknowledging Burra’s famous sons and daughters. Names that come to mind include: Thomas Pickett, Sir Henry Ayers, Henry Roach, Essington Lewis, Daisy Kennedy, Mary Warnes, Ian Auhl and Sir William Frederick Holder.</p>
<p>Voice of Youth is the premier public speaking competition for secondary school students in SA &amp; Broken Hill.

State finalists will compete this year in the National Final in Adelaide.</p>

<p>Princess Royal Station has been sold to C.R. &amp; S. Pty Ltd for an undisclosed sum. Princess Royal comprises 21,694 acres and was first taken up in 1845. It features in the district’s early mining history when a shepherd discovered copper there. Following this discovery two groups of investors, known as the Nobs and the Snobs, took up a mining lease. Each developed a mine. The Nobs developed the Princess Royal Mine, but it failed to deliver the same riches as the Monster Mine of the Snobs. Since 1864 only two families have owned the station; the McCullochs till 1900 and the Tennant family since then. Mr Simon Rowe of C.R. &amp; S. Pty Ltd said the property would predominantly be used as a cattle property, though sheep and cattle would remain a part of the program. The purchase would dovetail well with other operations of the T &amp; R Group. Cattle will be bred at Wertaloona Station and will come to Princess Royal before going to the C.R. 7 S. feedlot west of Clare and thence on to the abattoir at Murray Bridge. Cropping at the ‘Royal’ would contribute to the fodder and grain needs of the feedlot. The property is well-known for its magnificent heritage-listed homestead. Designed by Edmund Wright, this two-storey stone house was built in 1864 and sits in a beautiful park-like garden on the banks of the Burra Creek. Mr Simon Rowe, his wife Andrea and their children will live at Princess Royal. [Photo of the homestead.]</p>

<p>Susan and Tony purchased 100 acres of Burra hill country in 1990. In 1991 they planted the first of 10,000 native trees and their first apple tree, a Cox’s Orange Pippin. Since then they have planted some 800 trees from 70 sorts of apple, most of then antique varieties. They also built their mud brick home and moved in on Christmas Eve 1993. They moved permanently to Burra in 1995 and began making cider on an experimental basis. In 1999 they did a small business course and borrowed enough money to build the cider cellar. They opened tasting rooms on 13 July 1999, since when sales have exceeded projections. They have appointed a marketing manager and are speaking to Austrade about overseas exports. The customer base is 50% local and SA and 30% Sydney &amp; Melbourne.</p>

<p>Maureen Wright explains in a letter the financial arrangements of the Antique Fair. Each year up to $5,000 is spent on advertising. About $1,000 of this comes from local traders in sponsorship. Entertainment and equipment hire costs about $3,000. The co-ordinator receives $1,000 and other payments go to door staff, crèche and security. In all the committee has a budget of about $11,000. This year with other expenses the profit will be about $400. The committee is a non-profit organisation and a sub-committee of the Burra Traders Assoc. Any profit generated so far has gone into the Burra Antique Fair bank account as security against a bad weekend. Ultimately we hope to be able to support other community events.</p>

When challenged their response was that they had been doing it for ten years and Council was aware of it. Council has sent the firm a letter, but no action has resulted. The EPA has also not responded. Perhaps clients could have an impact by changing business is the company continues to act like an environmental vandal.</p>

<p>Perlite Gets Green Light</p>
<p>The Regional Council of Goyder has approved the planning application to establish a perlite factory at Burra. The EPA has asked that the Council insert some conditions in its approval. The next step was for the Council to be provided with engineering drawings for site structures. The factory is of significance for the state and nation in that its operation would significantly reduce the importation of perlite from the USA. It will reduce filtration costs for the wine industry. Ed James of Chillagoe Perlite said construction would begin as soon as possible with a capital investment of $600,000. Goyder Council CEO Steve Kerrigan said the factory was a welcome addition to the economy and would boost employment. It would give a demonstration that Burra can continue to improve as it will have a positive impact on Burra’s economy and inject millions of dollars into it. Mr James hopes the plant will be operating in time for the next vintage.</p>
<p>Weather. Snow fell on the hilltops of Burra, Peterborough, Hallett and Jamestown areas over the weekend.

<p>Burra CWA made a series of donations to local charities and organisations at a special afternoon tea gathering in the Old Courthouse on 26 May.</p>
<p>President Barbara Frances said Burra was where the first [SA] branch of the CWA was formed by the late Mary Warnes in 1926. During its early life the branch had a strong membership and clubrooms were built on land in Chapel St on land donated by the Warnes family. They were opened in 1961, but over the years membership declined and in 1991 it was resolved that the small numbers of members could not maintain the building and it was reluctantly sold. The proceeds were invested and the income used to help many organisations. A recent decision was made to give some of the branch’s funds to the community, so cheques were presented to:</p>
<p>Mr Bob McEvoy, Executive Director of the Heart Foundation</p>
<p>Mr Alan Jones, Donor Development Officer for the Anti-Cancer Foundation</p>
<p>Mr Craig Stanbridge, CEO of the Burra/Clare/Snowtown Hospitals</p>
<p>Maureen Wright, President of the Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust of SA</p>
<p>John Brak, Senior Administration Officer of the Regional Council of Goyder</p>
<p>Mr Ron Shipard, of the Burra Ambulance Board</p>
<p>Mr Len Newcombe, Secretary of Burra Burra Show Society</p>
<p>Over the last decade the CWA has made generous donations to many organisations including the Lions Club bus for seniors, SES, Bushfire Appeal, Little athletics, Burra Hospital, the Ambulance Service, Burra Kindergarten, Flood Relief Appeal, Lymphoedema Assessment Clinic, the bone densitometry unit, RFDS, the Lady Nell Seeing Eye Dog and the Dorothy Dolling Memorial Trust for the provision of training and rehabilitation for rural women and children. $2,000 has been given towards the creation of a new community room in Market Square, which has been named the Mary Warnes Community Room.</p>

<p>Burra National Trust has been conducting a planning review. The review found that the Engine house/Mine Site and Malowen Loweth were key elements in the offerings to visitors. The objectives of the new plan are:</p>
<p>To consolidate and enlarge the current cultural tourism offerings in Burra.</p>
<p>To convert the Market Square Museum into a National Trust business site.</p>
<p>To maximise the value of ‘outside sites’: the gaol, cellars, dugouts, smelts, Hampton, police lockup and the courthouse.</p>
<p>The first priority is to establish a copper interpretation centre, preferably at a national level and to consolidate the museums, particularly the Bon Accord and the diorama, at the Mine site.</p>
<p>This would free the Bon Accord Museum for development as a conference centre or for specialist displays, such as a printery, dentistry and blacksmithing shop.</p>
<p>It could be an accommodation facility or a venue for school groups.</p>
<p>The consolidation of the main museum elements at the mine site would allow for easier access for visitors and make for more efficient management for the branch.</p>
<p>A business plan is now needed for the Market Square site.</p>
<p>The feasibility of a copper interpretive centre at the mine needs investigation.</p>
<p>The building of a replica beam engine at the mine site has also been suggested.</p>

<p>Uniting Church Women’s Fellowship celebrated its 75th Anniversary on 18 June at a special Fellowship Service. The Fellowship had its origins as a Guild in 1925. For many years it raised money by holding fetes, but as numbers declined it was decided to hold trading tables in the street once or twice a year instead. It used to use the rooms now occupied by the Op Shop, but in 1989 they moved out for the shop to be set up. Over the years the Fellowship has helped bereaved families by providing luncheons or afternoon teas after funerals. Past Presidents have included: Rev. Secombe, Mrs Barrett, Mrs Potter, Mrs Baulderstone, Mrs C. Pearce, Mrs Atkin, Mrs Hobbs, Mrs Ashdown, Mrs V. Fennell, Mrs Martin, Mrs I. Nankivell and Mrs R. Tregilgas.

<p>Adchem has announced a record production and sales of copper oxide for the 1999-2000 financial year of 9,125 tonnes. This is a 25% increase on last year’s record performance. Simon Kibble, Operations Manager, said this was a great achievement. The challenge would now be to maintain their competitive advantage in the global market, which could be difficult with the prevailing higher copper prices. It was important that the company pursue opportunities to expand its market share. Mark Woodhead, Managing Director, estimated the company hold in excess of 35% of the global market for copper oxide at present. Their budget for the next financial year was for 8,250 tonnes. Adchem’s first full year result after acquiring the business from Golden Shamrock Mines Ltd in 1996 was 4,905 tonnes and production has grown every year since. The company currently employs 32 people. About $1.2 million is spent annually on capital expenditure and maintenance of the 30 year-old production facility. The annual revenue for the year was $27 million and came from over 20 countries. Improved performance comes from a decreased reliance on copper raw material derived solely from mined ore bodies and scrap metal. The company now has a wide range of raw material suppliers and processes copper-bearing residues and scrap to produce a value added industrial chemical.</p>

<p>Don &amp; Miriam Griffen and their children Amelia and Edward have relocated to Blanchetown after a long association with Mt Bryan &amp; the Burra District. Paddy Griffen arrived in Mt Bryan after his mother married Billy Dare of Mt Bryan East. Paddy married Mildred Simmons, a local girl and moved to Pt Adelaide where he worked for a wharf-building firm. After WWI his brother, Martin, was granted a soldier’s block at Mt Bryan. Paddy inherited this block after Martin’s untimely death in 1930. He moved in with his wife and family: Howard (13) and Kathleen (9). Howard was Dux of the School in Year 7. He worked on the farm until going to WWII, where he rose to the rank of Lieutenant. He spent most of his service in the Middle East as a radio operator with the 9th Division Cavalry. He was recalled home to train troops at Canungra in Queensland. During his time away he began corresponding with Sylvie Lloyd, a Leighton girl who was secretary of the Fighting Forces Comfort Fund, and they married in 1944.</p>
<p>After the war Sylvie and Howard were both very involved with the community. Sylvie was active in the CWA, the Mt Bryan School Welfare Club, The Methodist Church Ladies’ Guild, the Burra Show Society, Meals on Wheels, Red Cross and later the Burra Bowling Club among other things. Howard was a member of the Mt Bryan Agricultural Society, the School Council, the Mt Bryan Hall Committee, the Recreation Ground Committee, the Mt Bryan Methodist Church and the Burra Show, where he was largely responsible for bringing about the erection of the Wool Pavilion. He was also head steward for many years. Later in life he was very involved with the RSL and the Burra Bowling Club. His greatest service was with Legacy with which he was actively involved until he suffered a stroke in 1997. He will also be remembered for his enthusiasm and dedication to improving Merino sheep, including inventing the first fleece weighing wool table. He pioneered water and soil conservation and sustainable farming techniques.</p>
<p>Don followed in his father’s footsteps and was involved in Rural Youth, Apex, the Agricultural Bureau, Farmers’ Federation and various sporting organisations, including a long association with the Burra Volleyball Club and the multi premiership winning team ‘The Studs’. He was also involved with the Mt Bryan school Council, the Hall Committee, ‘Jam with Ham’, Burra Tourism Assoc., Merino Capital Committee, N. Areas Advisory Council for Agriculture, the Burra Show Society and Gaining Ground in Goyder. He was innovative in his farming techniques and sheep production. He designed and built a shearing shed with a separate facility for artificial breeding and was used extensively in the late 1980s when Don was involved in research and development with the Dept. of Agriculture and the Collinsville Merino Stud.</p>
<p>Dom and Miriam were married in 1982 and Miriam was also much involved in the community; first as a teacher at Burra and then at Mt Bryan. She has been involved with many organisations over the years including Mt Bryan-Hallett Play Group, School Council, Burra Guides, Crippled Children’s Assoc., and the Callisthenics Club and was a volunteer at the Regional Art Gallery.</p>

<p>A Southern Rangeland Rural Plan Meeting was held at Woolgangi Station 1 August, attended by about 25 people. Present from the Southern Rangelands Taskforce were Hon. Graham Gunn MP, Vice-Chairman Chris Reed, Julia Clarke, Michael McBride, Wendy Shirley, Jim Cawthorne and Joe Collins. Tas Sundberg the facilitator for the Central North East Farm assistance Program. This program developed out of the two failed Exceptional Circumstances applications – a $4 million program to help people living in the old E.C. Area. The workshop looked at three questions:</p>
<p>What is the thing that made most difference to your life in the past 10-15 years?</p>

<p>Become a bureaucrat and develop some strategies to help people in the Southern Rangelands.</p>

<p>Fire. A house fire at Mt Bryan completely gutted the building that was formerly the old Mt Bryan Post Office and Telephone Exchange. A man and two children were in the house at the time and were alerted to the fire by a passing bus. Five CFS units attended from Mt Bryan, Hallett, Booborowie and two from Burra with police, two SES units and the Ambulance. The cause is believed to have been an electrical fault. The Barrier Highway was closed with traffic diverted around Mt Bryan while the blaze was brought under control. [Photo]</p>

The students have long been involved in Trees for Life and Greening Australia projects. School principal Angela Arbon wrote the application and both she and the school are delighted to have been successful.</p>

<p>Annual Burra Open Cycling Handicap Event</p>
<p>There were many visitors around for the weekend with riders and supporters of the Annual Burra Open Cycling Handicap. Beginning in 1907 a cycling race was an annual event from Burra to Adelaide. Later in some years it was run from Adelaide to Burra. There were many different courses over the year, but eventually the introduction of traffic lights in the metropolitan area made the race impracticable. The format changed to a country event and for the last several years the race has been Burra to Riverton and return. This year riders set off between 11 and 11.40 a.m. on Saturday. A supporting 30 km event for juniors under 17 was run in the afternoon to the Tanks and back. On Sunday afternoon scratch races for both open and junior riders were run from Leighton Cricket Club to Mt Bryan and back.</p>

Yogi, the Red Angus was the best on the hoof, managing a fourth place in his class. On the hook Clancy was the champion trade carcase and only one point away from overall champion.</p>

<p>National Biodiversity Month is September, so perhaps this would be a good time to give an update on the Pygmy Bluetongue Lizard Recovery Project. We have found two new populations this year: one halfway between Clare and Blyth and the other at the top of Yorke Peninsula in the South Hummocks. The latter is exciting, as it is the furthest west the species has been found and the property now has a sanctuary agreement on it. The Blyth find is also significant in that it is near where one historical specimen is believed to have been found. It was sent to a museum in Vienna late last century [presumably 19th century] and said to have been found at Seven Hills near Melbourne. Since no pygmy bluetongue has been recorded in Victoria and there is no town of this name near Melbourne combined with the fact that the collector was known to have visited Clare, it seems likely it came from Sevenhill in the Mid North of SA. These finds make it more likely the species may soon be able to be downgraded from ‘endangered’ to ‘vulnerable’. Long term monitoring will have to be set up before this can be achieved. [The article then goes on to call for volunteers to help in monitoring and describes the process involved.]</p>

<p>SA Ambulance Service, Burra Branch held its AGM and Ron Shipard reviewed the year. The branch had progressed this year, with new recruits fully integrated. Burra CWA had donated $2,000 in a wonderful gesture and the branch had acquired a new VCR, TV and new rainwater tank. The driveway had been sealed. There had been 107 calls to the end of June. This year’s recruiting program had not managed to get any new recruits. There was a team of 14 active members. Matthew Barrowman was appointed co-ordinator after Garry &amp; Jenny Gebhardt resigned as the training team. His appointment restored enthusiasm and confidence. The F250 has been modified to a single stretcher ambulance and we hope the other vehicle will soon be replaced by something more appropriate. Ambulance Officers dressed as life-sized Christmas decorations won a prize in the 1999 Christmas parade and on New Year’s Eve officers waited for the impact of the Y2K fiasco.</p>

<p>SA Merino Ram Sales suggest a shift back to sheep by producers who had scaled down operations in the past decade. Demand for quality replacement sired lifted considerably. Buyers are targeting rams of lower microns and paying more attention to wool test figures, suggesting a primary interest in wool production. Prices for Merino ewes also rose, being $10 to $15 above last year for young ewes. Ram prices have been $100 to $200 up on average. Last week’s annual ram sale at East Bungaree saw a total clearance of 95 rams. At Collinsville’s successful ram sale prices were also up with a top price of $7,500.</p>

<p>Des Woolley has discovered a passage describing the Burra area in the journal of explorer Edward John Eyre, which reads: ‘To the eastward, this valley was skirted by bare hills rising in elevation towards the north, until they constituted a very high and singular succession of broken hills, wholly without any timber.’</p>
<p>There have often been suggestions that Burra must have been timbered in the early days, but here we have a credible eye witness account from the pre-mining days, saying that it was not.</p>

<p>Thamm’s Whitehart Garage has celebrated the 50th anniversary of its registration. The registration for Ron Thamm and his late father Cecil took place 6 October 1950. Previously the business had been owned by Cecil and his father Emil Ernest Thamm, beginning as a wheelwright and coach-building business when Emil Thamm came to Burra in 1914, having been driven south by the great drought of that year. Four generations of the family have been involved. Over recent years the garage has been run by Ron and Brian Thamm, but currently it is being run by Ron and Betty, David and Marion.</p>

<p>Burra Mine</p>
<p>The National Trust has secured a World Wildlife Fund/National Heritage Trust Grassy Ecosystems Grant to help conserve and manage the unique biodiversity of the patch of grassland on the Mine Hill. This diverse area includes many native grasses, lilies, daisies and other forms of vegetation. The grant will assist the Trust to undertake a botanical survey and mapping. A field botanist will be employed to carry out the research and field surveys. This will produce a species list and maps showing the condition of the vegetation, the plant communities and species composition, including species of conservation significance, and management zones. This will lead to an action plan to guide management decisions. A draft interpretive nature trail will be designed for use by school groups and the community. The last aspect of the grant is to help provide modest support for further research by subsidising travel funds and accommodation for a postgraduate student.</p>
<p>Burra Community Library has received two old books of historic interest. One is a ledger from the Burra Burra Mines 1865-69 detailing stores bought by the mining company. The other is a sales ledger belonging to Bob Lott’s father covering the period 1922-30. These donations come from the Lott family. The library has also received some old papers found in the cellar of the Burra Electric Supply Co. building. The minute books of the recently closed Hanson Agricultural Bureau have been copied before the originals were sent to Adelaide for preservation there.</p>

<p>Rev. Rod Peppiatt’s address on Burra history at the celebration of the Masonic Lodge’s 100 years occupancy of the former Kooringa Primitive Methodist Church is printed over two issues: this extract occupies about 3⁄4 page.</p>
<p>The union of three branches of Methodism in 1900 was only achieved after many years of hard work. This union freed the Kooringa Primitive Methodist for use by the Masonic Lodge. The Methodist churches in Burra in the 19th century were certainly a strong focus of worship and of social activity. Some of the preachers were of the ‘fire and brimstone’ variety and they must have offered an interesting diversion from the routines of everyday life. A story is told that Mr Philip Santo baptised a number of converts in Schneider’s Engine pool. Several workers did not turn up for work the next day until the afternoon. When questioned by Captain Roach about this they said they couldn’t come to work with all the sins of those men in the pool. Apparently Captain Roach accepted the excuse, but that ended baptisms at the mine. Whatever the reasons for the strength of the churches in the early days, it is clear that we are dealing with a people who were passionate in their faith and had a zeal for spreading the gospel. Three strands of Methodism were represented in Burra: the Wesleyans, the Bible Christians and the Primitive Methodists. The word Primitive in that group’s name indicated their desire to get back to the original teachings of Methodism: a back to basics movement. While there were differences between the three strands of the faith they also co-operated on many occasions and there was generally good will between them. One consequence of the enthusiasm of the Methodists in Burra was the surprising number of church buildings in the townships.</p>

<p>Merino Field Days will have a new format from 2001. They will be reduced from three to two days. This reflects similar changes recently in other states. They will be held on 19 &amp; 20 March 2001. Day one will feature a centralised showing and certain selected on-property displays. The second day will feature on-property displays only, for studs from the Gilbert valley to north of Hallett.</p>
<p>Paul &amp; Michelle Cousins have taken delivery of an optical fibre diameter analysing machine, which will be at the core of their Cousins Merino Services. The new machine has advanced wool testing capabilities. It measures wool staples from tip to base, providing critical information for breeding programs, optimising flock management and preparing lines of wool for sale. It can aid in genetic selection and can improve wool classing and marketing. [The article goes into further detail: becoming much like a paid advertisement for the service.]</p>

<p>Rod Peppiatt’s talk at the centenary of the Masonic Lodge’s premises is continued.</p>
<p>[The talk continues with an outline of where the Methodist chapels were in Burra.]</p>
<p>The Wesleyans had a chapel in Chapel St on the site of the present Uniting Church. And another in Redruth behind the present Lutheran Church. [This is incorrect: that chapel belonged to the Primitive Methodists.] There was another Wesleyan Chapel on Ludgvan Street.</p>
<p>The Bible Christians had a chapel in Paxton Square, but it quickly became too small and they built another in Bridge Street East. They also had one in Hampton.</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodists had a chapel at the Thames Street site in 1849, which was reopened and enlarged in the 1850s and then restored or rebuilt in 1879.</p>
<p>There were also Methodist chapels at Copperhouse, Iron Mine, World’s End, Hanson, and Baldina and into the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>In addition Burra had buildings erected by the Anglicans, Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Salvation Army, Baptists and independent churches. The activity was frenzied in the very early days and restarted with vigour when the men returned from the Victorian goldfields in the mid 1850s.</p>
<p>The Primitive Methodists seem to have been led by lay people until the appointment of William Whitfield in 1851. Unfortunately most of his congregation soon went to the Victorian goldfields. Rev. John Gibbon Wright arrived in 1856 to reopen the derelict chapel. He is recognised as one of the ‘characters’ of Burra’s early days. His booming voice is said to have been audible nearly half a mile away when the church windows were open. He managed to reopen the building on 24 August 1856 at a cost of £502, with a debt of £139. Funds were raised at tea meetings and several were held in that year. By 1860 he had moved on, but returned for a gathering in 1861 when 3,000 gathered in an open-air service.</p>
<p>When Methodist union occurred in 1900 several Methodist churches became surplus to the needs of the new church. Negotiations with Kooringa Lodge No. 6 commenced and the outcome was the sale of the building to them for about £350. The lodge held its first meeting in the building on 16 October 1900.</p>

<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery held its AGM recently at which Peter Harvey reported a successful year.</p>
<p>The gallery has mounted three special exhibitions during the year: the Art of the Flower, All that Jazz and the Archaeological Exhibition in conjunction with the Burra National Trust and the Flinders University. There have also been exhibitions of works by Dennis Dale, Leonard Bence and Ruth Norris as well as by the Burra Quilters. In attempting to show a wide representation of artists of the region we have displayed the works of 53 artists from the Adelaide Hills to the Flinders. In 1999-2000 there were 6,217 visitors to the gallery plus 455 children. The S.T. Gill interpretive project has begun with the help of former Burra Librarian/Historian Colin Fidock. Four major exhibitions are scheduled for 2001: Flight, to complement the opening of the Sir Hubert Wilkins Museum; The Centenary of Federation Road-show; the S.T. Gill display and our annual Art of the Flower. There will also be a full scale Burra Quilters Show and works of Gerry Wedd, photographs by Meredith Mayr and exhibitions by regional artists. [Thanks to the hanging teams and officers of the gallery followed.] Elected were: Chairman, Russell Skinner; Secretary, Helen Stockman; Treasurer, Bryan Dunnow and Assistant Secretary/Curator, Wendy Douglas.</p>

<p>Editorial: Burra’s Place in History</p>
<p>What has the Centenary of Federation to do with Burra? Burra was one of the most important towns in the country. It made a significant contribution to the economic development of SA and to many parts of Australia. It was world famous and produced a number of influential people.</p>
<p>One such was Sir Frederick William Holder. He came to Burra as a schoolteacher and became headmaster of the Kooringa Public School. Later he bought the Burra Record, was its editor and Mayor of Burra. He was then prominent in state politics before becoming the first Speaker of the House of Representatives and died in Parliament after an all night sitting. Did you know we have an oil painting of the great man? It is a tremendous link between Burra and Federation. The Regional Council of Goyder has been given a grant for the celebration of the Centenary of Federation. There will soon be a meeting to decide what to do about this. A few months ago I suggested a walk of fame either in Market Square or by the Town Hall. Put your thinking caps on and come to the public meeting when it is announced.</p>

<p>Plague Locusts are being sprayed around Terowie. The number of flying adults has increased right across the northern cropping zone of SA. The spraying is complicated by the harvest now in progress, which means landowners do not want spraying in their area during harvest. The weather has so far not been conducive to large distance movements and most flights have been a maximum of 20-30 km a day. Terowie and Whyte Yarcowie areas have so far had only minor crop damage, but greater damage was reported from the Georgetown area.</p>

<p>Centenary of Federation Meeting: Burra 27 November.</p>
<p>The meeting had to decide which recommendations for the celebration of the Centenary of federation would go forward to SA State Planning for funding.

<p>Koonoona Sales exceed $3 Million</p>
<p>Sales of the historic Koonoona property south of Burra have realised over $3,000,000 with lots 1-6 still to be sold. Koonoona was originally taken up in 1855 by a grant to Mr James Logan. It was an important Merino stud. At the time it comprised 43,000 acres, but it has been gradually reduced to the current 12,558 acres. In recent time it was a well-know stud property of the late Mr Ron Pearse. In 1980 the property was sold and Fares Rural Co. Pty Ltd operated there. It was a large international company and shipper of live sheep and carcase meat to the Middle East. The property became effectively a huge feed lot. A $7 million pellet mill was mooted for the property, but it failed to eventuate and Fares Rural relocated to nearer Adelaide. In 1984 it was sold to Gary Radford and in 1989 it became Old Collinsville Pty Ltd, managed by Neil Garnett as Principal. Since 1993 the registered owner of Old Collinsville and Principal Paddy Hanbury and family adapted Koonoona for cereal and lucerne production, with pasture improvement and conservative stocking of the strong grazing hills. It has also been committed to commercial on-property ram production. The current land sales have almost finished carving up the original land holding and only lots 1-6 remain to be sold.</p>

<p>Mackerode Carob Orchard</p>
<p>Twenty years ago Andrew Gebhardt of ‘Mackerode’ began planting carob tree orchards on his property. Many local wondered why. The property now has 100 acres of trees forming Australia’s first commercial carob orchard. It costs about $7,500 per hectare to establish carobs and there is no return for at least a decade, but when the trees mature and reach full bearing the returns should be about $10,000 per hectare. Of the world’s production of more than 300,000 tons of carob, Spain produces 50% and Italy &amp; Portugal a further 25%. The first Mackerode crop was harvested by hand in 1996. A mechanical harvester was introduced in 2000. In the mid 1990s market research was conducted with a small amount of carob syrup produced in a cottage industry style. It revealed there was a real market for the product. The first kibbler was imported in 1997 and is now commissioned at Burra. This separates the seed from the fruit and then water is added to dissolve soluble solids and create the syrup. Carob is seen as a healthy alternative to coffee or chocolate. It lacks the caffeine stimulant found in coffee and the theobromine stimulant found in chocolate. The Burra orchard has established a carob industry in Australia, but increased production will be needed to warrant construction of a local gum extraction plant. Once production has reached a suitable level, a marketing program will be required to exploit its potential as a food and drink flavouring.</p>
<p>The process of breaking up the carob pod and separating the seed and kibble requires a regional processing facility. The pods are passed through a slowly revolving hammer mill with the output going to a shaker/blower to separate the seed and the kibble. Production must currently be exported as there is no local processing facility. Macarob aims to produce an exceptional quality food flavour and to achieve organic classification. It intends to develop new and different uses for the product. Andrew &amp; Jen suggest its use as a drink. 1-2 dessertspoons of syrup in a cup of milk or half milk and half water, prepared either hot or cold. Or as a marinade: 2 dessertspoons with garlic, soy sauce and your favourite herbs &amp; spices. Or as a glaze to be brushed on roasting or grilling meat or poultry. Or in a stir fry. It can also be a flavouring in cakes, puddings or ice cream. With increased production carob powder could also be produced.</p>

<p>Annika Eder’s address at Burra Community School’s speech night is printed.</p>
<p>The year has taught me a lot about life and people. It has been the greatest experience of my life so far. I was someone who didn’t want to change schools or move to another place. I wasn’t really pleased initially at the thought of staying on a farm in the never-never or attending a school with as many students as my senior school at home. But I quickly changed my mind on arrival. Everyone was so friendly that I soon forgot initial concerns and set about adjusting to the 40° Australian summer. First term sporting activities were a great way to meet people. Team and community spirit seemed much stronger here than at home. For the first time I felt comfortable around people, because they respected me for who I am, I could really be myself without having to fit in with the picture people had of me. On the down side I soon found that in a small community what you say and do gets around to everyone very soon. School was different, with the long school bus trip and the lunch breaks three times the length of those in Germany. It took a while to get to know the people my own age and even harder was to get into conversations where everyone else had watched ‘Neighbours’ and ‘Home and Away’ and laced their conversation with casual references to them. But everyone made me feel welcome and I got asked to parties from the start. Agriculture was a great subject to help me get to know the community and the social environment. We had to work as a team to get our beloved steers to the show. It was also a new experience to be at a school with students of all ages. I enjoyed teaching a bit of German to some primary kids. The opportunity to visit other parts of Australia was also a great experience. The Burra Squash competition was anew experience in that all age groups played together, while in Germany competition is only between players of the same age group. Social interaction was also a major difference and I think I am still a bit too German when I feel awkward calling adults I’ve just met by their first name. I will miss the generally laid back attitude here and the many Australian expressions I have learnt. I am grateful too for the members of BCS staff and the community of the district who have contributed so much to the great success of the year. [Photo]</p>

<p>Terowie Water Supply</p>
<p>Following complaints from Terowie residents about the quality of their water supply, SA Water has advised that like all northern railway towns, they are supplied with water drawn from local earthen storages that rely on run-off from rainfall events. The water is coloured and of variable microbiological quality. When it is dry water is carted in. It is not economically viable to disinfect such water supplies and customers are advised it is non potable and should be boiled for several minutes before drinking.</p>

<p>Ngadjuri</p>
<p>The Minister for the Arts, Diana Laidlaw has announced a $12,000 grant is to be made for the creation of a Ngadjuri Cultural Exhibition in Burra and a further $12,000 is to be made available for the SA Museum from its indigenous outreach program. The Ngadjuri once lived from Gawler to Orroroo. Elder of the Ngadjuri Fred Warrior has been working for a number of years to have some interpretation and exhibition of Ngadjuri culture. The Council BCD, the National Trust and the Burra Regional Art Gallery support the proposal and the old library room [previously the old Lodge Room] at the Town Hall has been chosen for the exhibition.</p>
<p>[It is to be hoped that this $12,000 – or potentially $24,000 – was not simply wasted, because no such room eventuated and neither did an exhibition in an alternative venue.]</p>

<p>Booborowie IGA has changed hands as from 8 January. Chris Catt sold the business after 18 years to Roger Florence &amp; Monique Haddow. Chris grew up in Booborowie and moved away in the banking industry. In 1982 Chris and his brother James bought Booborowie Servwel Store from Alex &amp; Muriel Patterson. Chris left his ANZ Bank job in Adelaide to run the store with his brother. After two years James left and Chris continued alone. Australia Post Office and hardware became part of the business about seven years ago. The business has had several name changes and in the 1950s it was a John Martin’s store for about four years. Monique Haddow and husband Vic ran Paxton Square for two years after moving into the district some 61⁄2 years ago. They have been living in Booborowie for the past four years. Roger Florence is Monique’s father and after thirty years in the insurance industry in Adelaide has come to Booborowie for a ‘quieter’ life – although he says they have been busier than he expected. He will work full-time and Monique part-time – with Heike Dargusch also continuing on part-time.</p>

<p>Father David Burgess was ordained as a priest and subsequently commissioned as Priest-in-charge of the Burra Parish last Saturday morning. The clergy who attended included Bishop Garry Weatherill and Bishop Phillip Aspinall along with some 20 priests from this and other dioceses. It is almost three years since Burra had a permanent resident priest. In that time regular services have depended on the three Pastoral Assistants, Michael Burge, Geraldine Smedley and Mary Woollacott. David completed training as a deacon at St Mary Magdalene’s Church in the city. Rosemary Nairn came from Adelaide to play the organ and Burra Ecumenical Choir led the singing. Garry Weatherill, who had been 6th Bishop of Willochra for just a week, gave the address.</p>
<p>John David Burgess is aged 35 and has previously worked as a registered nurse – most recently at Dawe House Hospice at the Repatriation General Hospital in Adelaide. David and his wife Kate have been married for four years. David’s son Zac is 12 and he is living in England this year with his mother who is on a work exchange. David’s other interests include eating and drinking (in moderation), bushwalking, cycling, swimming and enjoying a wide variety of music. Kate is 28 and has been one of the Ministry Development Officers in the Diocese of Adelaide.</p>

<p>Obituary. Ronald Edward Dewhirst BEM. 8 May 1908 to 3 March 2001</p>
<p>Ron was born in Broken Hill, the eldest child of Charles Dewhirst and Elsie nee Baynes. As a young fellow he worked as a Broken Hill Mining Co.’s office boy who went underground for five years. He was sent bush at the age of 19 to recuperate from a serious motorcycle accident, working as a timber cutter, stationhand and a mail van driver. He was also an assistant at Booborowie General Store, then owned by Allan &amp; Les Pearce. There he took on bookkeeping. He studied for three years and passed his Certificate of Proficiency in 1936. In 1933 he married Elsie McMillan if Adelaide. They had three children – Betty, John and Alan. When his employers’ business took him to outlying properties he picked up jobs helping farmers with their books and tax. In 1947 he joined to Taxation Institute and three years later established his own firm with his son John and 40 clients. In the 1970s he was awarded a British Empire Medal for service to the community and especially for his involvement with swimming. He was always closely involved with the church; initially with the Congregational Church in Broken Hill and in Booborowie with the Methodist/Uniting Church and more recently with the Westbourne Park Uniting Church. Elsie’s illness caused the move to Adelaide in 1986 to Resthaven at Kingswood. He continued to serve a reduced clientele from his Pirie Street Office until forced to retire due to a stroke in 1999. He will be remembered for his generosity, faith and a keen sense of humour. Sport played a large part in his life and he was also much involved with the Masonic Lodge for many years.</p>

<p>Avian &amp; Freda Pink will leave Burra in the first week of April.</p>
<p>Avian has been heavily involved with the National Trust, the Men’s Agricultural Bureau, BRTBA, Burra Tennis Club, Burra Tourism Association and Probus. Freda’s interests have included BRTBA, MNRDB, National Trust, Women’s Bowls, Tourism Advisory Committee, Burra Tourism Association and the Women’s Agricultural Bureau. She has been a Mid North Regional Councillor and editor of WAB Newsletter and has been involved with TAFE as well as being a JP and marriage celebrant. They are retiring to Ardrossan.</p>
<p>Avian’s great grandfather worked and had land here in the 1860s. When mining slowed down he went to work on Buttermuck Station out of Dawson. Later he and his family returned to Clare and founded F. Pink &amp; Sons (now Mitre 10), one of the few Mid North businesses still owned and managed by his descendants. After farming in Hill River for nearly 30 years, Avian and Freda bought Basin Farm in 1977 and moved here in 1982; selling the farm to Graham and Elspeth Radford in 1985. They then bought and ran the Mobil Roadhouse until December 1988 and early in 1989 opened Burra View House as a B &amp; B. Its new owners will take this over at the end of March this year.

<p>Heritage Status</p>
<p>There is a proposal before Federal Parliament to dramatically reduce the 13,000 places on the register of the National Estate to several hundred that are of ‘truly’ national heritage significance on a new National Heritage List.</p>
<p>In SA there are hundreds of places on the National Register that are not on the State Register. The Town of Burra is on both the Federal and State Lists. The town is one of 14 such sites listed as a State Heritage Area and numerous individual buildings in Burra are listed in their own right on both the State and National Registers.</p>
<p>The Goyder Heritage Advisory Committee has recommended to Council that Federal Minister for Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, be lobbied to make sure Burra retains its National Heritage listing. Goyder Council Planning Officer John Brak said it seems clear the Federal Government’s aim is to cull the list to avoid responsibility for funding the conservation of places of national significance – devolving that responsibility to the States. The State meanwhile is doing a similar thing by urging local governments to create their own lists of local heritage places. National Trust Chairperson Maureen Wright said we should be lobbying for the Federal Government to use the present list as a basis for any pruning rather than to start again with a clean sheet. It would be a good idea for the local council to have a heritage list as it would give it an advantage in attracting funding that might be available for State listed properties.</p>

Mrs Ellen Scott alone was the proprietor from 25 July 1962 to February 1969. H.C. Jones died 24 July 1962. Ellen then married Wally Scott in 1969 – licensing records suggest in February, but the item above suggests April. As Mrs Scott, she was the registered proprietor until 8 June 1975.]</p>

<p>Squash. The high cost of public liability insurance has caused the owner of the squash courts at Burra to suspend squash for the coming winter season. A premium of $1,500 is needed for a $10 million cover and this would add about $40 to each membership. Terry Wilson, a squash player, says the squash courts are for sale and the asking price is less than replacement cost, so it would be fantastic if they could be publicly owned like so many other sporting facilities in the town.</p>

<p>Burra National Trust has raised concerns re the grinding of the slate footpaths in Market Square. The grinding is to reduce the danger of tripping pedestrians. Council director of operations, Peter Bowden said the grinding was the first step. The longer term is to further smooth the ground surface, age them chemically and fill in open joints with flexible grout. Apparently no heritage advice had been taken.</p>
<p>Letter. John Agnew writes on GM crops in response to the negative article the previous week by Ally Fricker. She listed the dangers, but none of the potential benefits, such as increased yields or less reliance on chemicals to control pests and weeds. He says genetic modification has been going on for ages by selected breeding and even across species barriers as with intriticale from wheat and rye. The modification could be adding genetic material or for example switching off an enzyme that leads to brown bruising in peaches. GMOs need to be assessed individually, not have a blanket ban thrown over all.</p>

<p>Sir Hubert Wilkins is perhaps one of the most underrated Australian adventurers of the twentieth century, but functions at Hallett and Mt Bryan East over the weekend could begin to redress that. Modern day adventurer and entrepreneur Dick Smith flew in to open the restored Wilkins’ Family homestead at Mt Bryan East on Sunday afternoon. The replica Southern Cross plane made a trip from Parafield over the area. Sir Hubert sold the original ‘Southern Cross’ to Charles Kingsford Smith, who then fitted it out for the historic crossing of the Pacific Ocean. Hubert Wilkins, or George as he was known locally, was a key figure in exploration of the Arctic and also made several trips to Antarctica. He was later based in New York, but always considered himself an Australian. The Chairman of the Sir Hubert Wilkins Memorial Committee praised the builder of the restored homestead, Neil Schiller of Burra for his workmanship and also mentioned the long list of people who had been associated with the Twilight Jazz Affairs for the past four years. The Wilkins homestead has changed hands many times since the Wilkins with their 13 children lived there in the late nineteenth century. Goyder Council bought the land from Brian Guthrie, who had bought it from Robin Jones.</p>
<p>On Saturday night more than 300 people filled Hallett Hall to see the film documentary Ice Maverick – still a few months from completion. During his lifetime Sir Hubert received widespread acknowledgement and awards from the most important geographical and scientific societies for his work in the fields of geography, climatology and meteorology. When 17 he taught himself the use of a movie camera and projector. In 1910, at 22, he learnt to fly a plane and filmed across enemy lines in the Balkan conflict in 1913, after which he was awarded the Military Cross.</p>
<p>[While strictly true, this statement is misleading. He was awarded a Military Cross, but this was in World War I after the Battle of Hamel in June/July 1918. He was also awarded a bar to the Military Cross in September 1918.]</p>
<p>He spent three years in the Arctic and joined the Shackleton expedition [to Antarctica] in 1921. In 1923 he led an expedition in tropical Australia and in 1928 made the first successful flight across the Arctic, covering 3,500 km from Alaska to Spitsbergen. The American newspaper giant Randolph Hearst was his major backer. He then [1929] took a round the world flight in the airship Graf Zeppelin and married [Australian singer and actress Suzanne Bennett]. He also bought a decommissioned US submarine for $1 and attempted [in 1931] to take it under the ice to the North Pole. After his death in 1958 aged 70 his ashes were scattered at the North Pole [1959] by an American submarine crew. [Photos: 1 on page 1, 6 on page 4 and 2 on page 5.]</p>

<p>District Ranger Ian Falkenberg successfully returned a wedge tailed eagle to the wild near Mt Bryan last week. It had been found near Hallett suffering from minor wing damage, perhaps from hitting a fence or power lines while hunting in March. The same bird was found in August last year in a poor condition in a paddock near Burra, unable to fly. This is not uncommon for young eagles who fail to make the grade and find it hard to find food in cold winters. After a brief stay in captivity at the Monarto Zoo facility it was released in October last year. Wedge tail eagles rarely get a second chance and over 60% of young eagles die in their first year.

<p>East Bungaree Stud is to be dispersed. Due to a business restructure and growing demand for the finer woolled Hazeldean sheep on the East Bungaree Property it has been decided to disperse the East Bungaree stud flock in October. East Bungaree’s origins predate Burra, when in 1841 the Bungaree Stud was formed. In 1906 the Bungaree property was divided with each of founder George Hawker’s sons taking a part. Edward purchased several other properties, including Belcunda, Caroona, Oakbank and lucerne country in the Booborowie Valley. In 1937 East Bungaree Ltd was formed and the stud was known as East Bungaree-Belcunda. When son Stanley Hawker died in 1979 the property was sold to W.H. Wylie, who made a number of changes. The property reverted to the family in 1986 with its purchase by Andrew &amp; Virginia Hawker. In recent years the Litchfield family with the famous Hazeldean Stud near Cooma bought the property and now use it to promote the Hazeldean line of stud sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>Hallett Power Station</p>
<p>Power retailer AGL plans to diversify into power generation by building a 250 megawatt power station 16 km west of Hallett. It will help alleviate the critical peak power supply situation in SA and help avoid the very high marginal costs of peak demand periods. The proposed site is c. 2 km north of Canowie on the Booborowie-Jamestown Road, with access to the Moomba-Adelaide natural gas pipeline and high tension power lines from Jamestown. AGL expects 50% of the capacity to be operational by next summer. AGL has addressed the Goyder Council, seeking its co-operation in subdividing the 20 ha required and in speeding up the other processes. The plant would be fired up when electricity was in high demand – characteristically when heat produces a spike in demand due to air conditioning. It is anticipated it would run for 300-400 hours per annum. The project is to cost c. $50 million.</p>

<p>Australian Federation</p>
<p>John Bannon, former Premier of SA spoke at Burra Town Hall on Thursday evening 17 May on the subject of Federation. He is currently working on a PhD on the subject and so had plenty of information to pass on. Australians are not well informed on the subject. The decision to federate passed only narrowly and followed great deal of argument and compromise. In SA between 1891 and 1900 most of the argument was focused on the benefits SA would get through its central location in trade and telecommunications and benefits derived from the lifting of tariffs on wine and on the through traffic to Broken Hill. There were also concerns over the River Murray. For Burra it was of interest that Sir Frederick Holder played an important part and became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives. He had once been a teacher in Burra, then owner of the Burra Record and eventually Treasurer/Premier of SA. The vote in favour of federation in Burra was 79%. Mr Bannon presented the Centenary of Federation Medallions to BCS students at a ceremony in Market Square.</p>

Miss Mabel was born in the cottage in 1883 as the twelfth of thirteen children born to Samuel and Ann Baker, who moved into the cottage in 1862. She continued to live there until shortly before her death in 1983. Phil Brook is a joiner by trade and Rosemary a chef before coming to Australia from Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Diprotodon Skeleton Found</p>
<p>Robert Heading, an amateur palaeontologist has discovered the fossilised remains of a giant diprotodon near Burra. Diprotodons were the largest marsupials that ever lived and weighed up to two tonnes. They lived in Australia and New Zealand. The find has interested researchers from Flinders University and the SA Museum, who will visit the site today and assess the skeleton’s suitability for display purposes. The fossil could be up to 40,000 years old.</p>

<p>Diprotodon Find</p>
<p>Professor Rod Wells of Flinders University is excited about the latest find of Diprotodon bones east of Burra. There are seven known fossil locations in the region, making this significant in the field of Australian natural history. Discoveries include giant wombats, giant kangaroos, big herbivores the size of bison and a marsupial lion. There is a question why all these animals became extinct. Was it climatic change or the introduction of human activities? These sites are part of a much bigger jigsaw puzzle. Professor Wells said preservation could best be done with the co-operation of the community, which would leave it open for a local display of natural history. Burra Visitor Centre manager Janelle Cousins saw this as an opportunity to develop natural history as a tourist attraction to go hand in hand with Ecotours, Burra Trail Rides and the Dare’s Hill Drive.</p>

<p>Burra Home Buyers are hurt by Mortgage Insurance Policy</p>
<p>Burra home buyers are typically asked to pay 20% down while a similarly priced house in Clare requires only a 5% deposit. Bank can loan only up to 80% of the purchase price and when customers want more, mortgage insurance from underwriters is required. Location determines the criteria of the insurance that will allow more to be lent. There is of course a lower risk on loaning money on houses that increase in value as time passes. Burra houses are at a disadvantage in this respect, though properties have been on the move, with prices changing a lot even in the last six months.</p>
<p>Burra Motor Inn is celebrating ten years of operation. Peterborough businessman Tim Carter approached the Burra Council for options on where to build a motel.

This he ascribes to the rebranding of the region as Clare valley, which brings the focus of Sa Tourism’s ‘Secrets’ campaign on our region, and secondly to ‘The Burra and Beyond’ brochure pioneered by Janelle.</p>

<p>Gary and Gail Edwards at Aberdeen Roadhouse have the SA Farmers Fuel logo on their petrol pumps. Gary said the pricing policies of the major companies do not allow them to offer country customers what outlets in the city can offer. SAFF delivers to rural community stores, service stations and roadhouses in conjunction with the on farm deliveries and they have a policy of not being undersold. He says it seems Burra fuel prices have dropped since it was known a SAFF outlet was coming. [Photo of Gary &amp; Gail with price sign ‘Unleaded 91.9’]</p>

<p>Graham Radford has had to close his Burra Trail Rides on the outskirts of the town because his public liability insurance has risen from $150 to $9000 in just two years. Once gone, it will be hard to reinstate the business, as it takes years to get a good team of horses together. Rising public liability insurance premiums have also seen the shelving of plans for Burra Picnic Races at Thistlebeds in 2002.</p>
<p>Burra’s squash season 2001 was cancelled due to the same problem and one local church was even told by its head office that one option was not to have weddings due to the increase in public liability insurance. Goyder Council says their costs are rising as contractors add the insurance costs to their tenders.</p>

<p>Llewellyn Jones from Salisbury is taking on the management of the Burra Cultural Centre. [Town Hall &amp; Gallery] His purpose will be to revitalise the centre and increase use and income. A Ngadjuri display is planned for the south side rooms. Goyder Council said some $24,000 of funding has already been confirmed and word on an extra $24,000 is expected soon. Council budgeted for $20,000 from capital projects to be spent on the Town Hall in 2000-01, but it ended up unused.</p>

<p>Letter.</p>
<p>The issue of 4 July on page 2 had carried a letter from ‘A Week-in-Week Out Parent’ about the ‘Wanderer’ local football report – complaining that football reports were confined to the A and B Grades and wishing for some reporting of the minis team, the junior colts and the senior colts, whether from their coaches or from ‘Wanderer’.</p>
<p>This week ‘Benchwarmer’ and a ‘Proud BBH Supporter’ suggest there may be good reasons why ‘Wanderer’ confines reports to the A &amp; B Grades and instead of suggesting that someone already doing something for the club does more, the critics should take up the burden themselves.</p>

<p>The Council and Burra</p>
<p>The editor reflects on the Goyder Council’s rating structure with respect to the Town of Burra.</p>
<p>Rates are high – very high.</p>
<p>Burra house owners pay nearly two thirds more rates on their property investment than their rural counterparts and those in other towns in Goyder.</p>
<p>But, the answer comes, they get more services.</p>
<p>If Burra received 60% more services than Eudunda there would be an almighty outcry.</p>
<p>Burra residents also have on average higher valuations on their houses than the other towns in the region and therefore higher rates bills.</p>
<p>Why then do they have the inequality of a 60% premium on the rate in the dollar?</p>
<p>Though Burra Ward generates almost the same amount of rates as the other three wards put together, it has only five of the 13 elected members of Council.</p>
<p>Who of those would personally consider this an issue?</p>

<p>Fire. A quick thinking and active driver was able to use extinguishers in his truck to put out a burning tyre on Sunday morning. The fire seems to have started from an overheated brake. The truck carried bananas in an ethylene gas environment, which had the potential to incinerate the load in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Issue 515, 25 July 2001, page 4</p>
<p>Goyder Council has budgeted for an increase in rates this year of 6.8%.</p>
<p>Property values have risen by an average of 4% and the rest is generated by an increase in the rate in the dollar. The Council is moving towards rate parity for rural areas:</p>
<p>Hallett and Eudunda rural areas are rated at 3.819 c in the dollar</p>
<p>Robertstown rural areas are rated at 3.986 c in the dollar</p>
<p>Burra rural areas are rated at 4.616 c in the dollar</p>
<p>Burra Town area is rated at 7.8 c in the dollar</p>
<p>Waste Collection charges have dropped from $65 to $58 due to the reduced dump times and the introduction of wheelie bins.</p>

<p>John Shipard writes complaining that ratepayers in Goyder are not getting value for money.</p>
<p>He writes a second letter in response to an advertisement seeking public comment on the naming of the park at Burra North located by Smelts Road, Ludgvan St and The Crescent.</p>
<p>[At least from the establishment of the playground there in 1923 this area was known as Lowe Park. It was named after Mr Charles Lowe 1854-1925. Until 1921 he lived at Redruth where he had a bakery near to the park. He was also a member of the Town Council, representing North Ward from December 1907 to November 1913.]</p>
<p>Mr Shipard’s advice was to subdivide the area adjacent to the derelict tennis courts into six new housing blocks for sale to the public. This would provide housing in Burra where there is a genuine shortage as well as generating employment. The completed development should then be named the Scroop Estate.</p>

<p>Letter from John Worrall of Eudunda re two recent letters from Mr J. Shipard.</p>
<p>On 1 August he says Mr Shipard’s Letter fails to tell the whole story –</p>
<p>City folk get more services, better footpaths, cheaper transport, shopping centres, more banks, more doctors, BUT ALSO more pollution, more crime, more drugs, more road congestion and more stress and fear.</p>
<p>Why did Mr Shipard move to Burra from the city? City Councils have ten times the ratepayers and one fiftieth of the land area to serve – they should be able to do more.</p>
<p>Mr Shipard’s second letter was more positive and if his facts are correct, he presents a valid alternative. Mr Worrall challenges him to research the Council’s income and expenditure in detail and present us with informed proposals to get more services and pay lower rates.</p>

<p>Mid North Counselling Service had its AGM last week and Kathy Ottens reflected on her time as a rural counsellor for ten years. The improvement in the rural economy had made her workload more achievable, with less need for cash-flow budgeting one reason for the reduction in demand. Problems and financial difficulties of course continue and a series of good years is needed to make a big difference and poverty still arises when jobs are lost or families break up. State Member of Parliament Caroline Schaefer was the guest speaker. She gave an overview of the state of the rural sector.</p>
<p>Letter. Jill Harnett writes as a relatively new resident of Burra that she was astounded at the 30% rate increase. The explanation offered by the Clare Valuer General’s Office was that her home had been under-valued for several years. While accepting the explanation, she felt there must be a way of eliminating such human error that results in difficulties later.</p>

The pub offers late night closing on Fridays and Saturdays and in the week four pool teams are playing in a Wednesday night competition. Nominated drivers are provided with free soft drinks to encourage responsible driving.</p>

In 1965 he began a 12-month Line Maintenance Training Course at Rostrevor, graduating in 1966 and then worked in the Mid North, the North and Northeast of the state. In 1979 he was promoted to Line Supervisor at Kadina Regional Office and in 1982 joined Field Engineering Northern as Line Officer involved in planning an external plant in SA which covered all the state north of Adelaide. He later saw optical cables laid, doing much of the planning for that. The longest route he was involved on was Marla to Ayers Rock of 400 km. Currently he is in charge of planning for all country SA from his office in Kadina. Not many people these days can say they have worked for the same company for 40 years.</p>

<p>Goyder Council in conjunction with the Mid Murray Council is seeking funds to seal the Bower to The Gums road. The idea is to make the route from Murray Bridge to Port Pirie pass along this road as an alternative Highway 1 for heavy vehicles.

<p>Redruth Camp Centre</p>
<p>Operations are currently being reviewed. In 2000 the Centre, comprising the former Redruth Methodist Church and Sunday School and the former Courthouse Hotel, had some 2,300 bed nights occupied. Operation of the Centre devolved from the synod to the local parish in 1995. Manager Helen McColl has done a great job in that time. Over the past few years it has needed injections of funds from the Op Shop. A committee set up to examine operations has made the preliminary recommendation that it cease to operate at the end of 2001 and that the buildings then be sold. A community meeting to consider this has been called for 24 September in the Burra Uniting Church Hall. Among other considerations is the fact that there is a declining number of camps. In the first half of 2001 the number of camps was down by seven and the long term trend is downwards. The cause of such a decline is not clear, but factors could include:</p>
<p>The site is now split by a busier road.</p>
<p>The cost of bus transport to Burra has risen.</p>
<p>Fewer schools are holding camps due to increasing legal obligations and perhaps the ageing of the teaching force.</p>
<p>In any case the loss for 2000-01 is considerable.</p>
<p>Maintenance in recent years has been minimal and considerable costs need to be met there in the future.</p>
<p>The buildings are heritage items and so there are no simple solutions.</p>
<p>The decision will be made by the Church Council – possibly in October.</p>

<p>Redruth Camping Centre is facing an unknown future. The complex has 90 beds and has been a destination for many school camps, but dwindling bed nights per year and losses amounting to $10,000 per annum are forcing its owners to consider whether it can continue in its present form. In the last five years 9,500 bed nights have been spent there. This week a school group of 90 will spend $2,000 on catering in Burra. In recent years nearly $40,000 has been spent on fire regulation upgrades.</p>

<p>BCS has a new shearing shed. Having acquired Brewery Hill in 1997, the school flock was expanded to 150 ewes. Shearing has been done in the corner of the main shed for years, but the increase in the flock has led to a new shed being erected. The shed in part used money previously allocated for a toilet on Brewery Hill and incorporates a wheelchair accessible toilet. Other funds came from enterprises on Brewery Hill. Redden Bros won the contract. Alan Jacka and David Nourse built and plumbed the toilet respectively. The shed was first used for shearing on 24 September. An official opening is planned for early November. [2 photos.]</p>

<p>Hallett Centenary of Federation Celebrations</p>
<p>On Saturday evening local and visiting people gathered to see the unveiling of a sculpture comprising two sheep, a dog and Statton Gates. These were chosen as sheep and wool have always been Hallett’s main industry. It is believed that the first consignment of wool from SA to be sold in England was from the sheep runs of John &amp; Alfred Hallett. The gates were famous for being made at Statton’s Blacksmith’s Shop in Hallett. Ned Statton founded the business in 1892 and it was soon a flourishing business in Alfred Street. Ned and his sons were innovative and as well as standard blacksmithing they patented several inventions of which the most widely used locally was the Statton gate. Thousands were made and can still be seen on properties today. After serving the district for 63 years the blacksmith’s business closed in 1957. Marcus Possingham, the artist in residence in the Goyder Council area for these projects, helped design and create the project along with a local committee. Three interpretive boards were also unveiled by Henry &amp; Mary Krichauff. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Australia’s Open Garden Scheme will feature three Mid North gardens this year.</p>
<p>Old North Bungaree (Louise &amp; Phillip Jacka)</p>
<p>A long drive lined with gnarled olives leads to a garden set out in the 1920s and recently revived in sympathy with the original concept. A grand oak stands in the midst of formal beds planted with roses, irises, lavender and old fashioned perennials. There is a lawn terrace and wisteria draped verandahs.</p>
<p>Princess Royal Station (Simon &amp; Andrea Row)</p>
<p>The garden surrounds the magnificent 1860s stone house with a sweeping driveway, croquet lawn, herbaceous borders and mature trees. There are massed plantings of late bulbs, roses and perennials. The banks of the creek have been terraced with dry stone walls with paths to [the remains of] a swing bridge designed by Edmund Wright and built in the 1870s.</p>
<p>Ashrose (Robert &amp; Susan Ashby)</p>
<p>The long driveway leads through a plantation of gums and saltbush. The homestead garden shelters behind a tall hedge of carobs. There are claret and golden ashes to give shade to the mixed beds and borders where there are shrubs, bulbs and perennials. There is a long pergola covered with banksia roses.</p>

<p>Open Gardens</p>
<p>Between 700 and 900 people took advantage of the open gardens at Princess Royal, Old Ashrose of Hallett and Old North Bungaree. The Princess Royal Garden has been upgraded in recent years and is now looked after by Pauline and Terry Bevan from Burra for owner Simon Rowe, who said he was surprised by the amount of interest generated. In Burra 14 gardens were open to the public and up to 60 people went on a walk through them. Over $200 was donated to charity.</p>

<p>Jazz in the Monster Mine in 2002 has secured Elders SA as the naming rights sponsor. The event has been given the go-ahead by the Goyder Council. The site is presently being used by the SA Diving School and site works are required to level the area and remove feral Aleppo pines. The committee expects to sell all 400 tickets. Profits from the event are earmarked for the maintenance of Burra’s mining heritage and for the upkeep of Sir Hubert Wilkins’ cottage. The Twilight Jazz Affair, held for the past four years at Petherton homestead was able to raise much of the funding for the rebuilding of the Wilkins homestead. The other fixture to use the mine site, the Adelaide Festival country event planned for Burra in mid-March 2002, has been cancelled due to lack of funding. This had intended to use the grading floor area just inside the gate near Morphett’s Enginehouse. [Photo showing Diving School activity on the shelf at the water’s edge.]</p>

<p>Burra Walk of Fame</p>
<p>The Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives, Neil Andrews will open a new ‘Walk of Fame’ and unveil a restored portrait of the first Speaker of the House of Representatives, Sir Frederick Holder, who was at various times editor of the Burra Record, town clerk and Mayor of Burra. The ‘Walk of Fame’ plaques are to be set in the footpath outside the Town Hall and feature people who have made a major contribution to Australia and have a strong connection to Burra and District. They include Sir Henry Ayers (Mine secretary and Premier of SA), George Strickland Kingston (first Member of Parliament for the District), Mary Warnes (founder of the CWA in SA), Essington Lewis (engineer, miner and founder of BHP) and John Collins (founder of Collinsville stud). It is envisaged that the walk will be extended in the future. The new portrait gallery in the Town Hall will also be opened to house paintings and photographs of community leaders since 1876. The organising committee expects a number of family members of those in the ‘Walk of Fame’ to be present. The day will feature maypole dancing and in the evening a music hall variety program. On 11 November there will be a breakfast in the park along the creek followed by the Armistice Day ceremony.</p>
<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery reports a successful year. At the AGM on 24 October Chairman Peter Harvey reported that some 14 exhibitions had been staged in the gallery and the Town Hall. Attendance had risen with visits of 5,951 adults and 1,435 children. This has been possible through the support of many volunteers. The exhibitions have features a wide diversity. With no operational funding, the gallery relies on commission from sales and donations. Sales have been modest and the support of friends is being sought. The gallery is seeking state funding to enable the installation of air conditioning for the Bence and Gill Rooms and for humidity control mechanisms. [Some of the exhibitions are then referred to.]</p>

<p>Hallett Power Station</p>
<p>Work on this 180 megawatt station is progressing well and is ahead of schedule. 160 to more than 200 tradespersons are working there at any one time. Work is expected to take six months. The plant will be a top-up generator and may not run in cool years. It will use gas from Epic’s Moomba pipeline just 600 m away. There are currently six turbines on site with six more in Perth and due at Hallett in early December. The first 90 megawatts are due to come on line by the end of December with the other 90 by the end of January next.</p>
<p>Adchem</p>
<p>The demand for copper oxide is at an unprecedented high level. Adchem is confident of production in excess of 10,000 tonnes for this financial year. Production in October was 984 tonnes – a record monthly production figure. Increasing cost of gas and electricity has seen costs rise by $100,000 over the past year and the cost of raw materials has also increased sharply – both for imports and locally sourced scrap metal. While new contracts are being negotiated to reflect these costs, old contracts are seeing a reduction in profit margins. Plant operating days are being maximised to increase productivity and the plant will run through the Christmas and New Year period.</p>

<p>Burra National Trust and the SA State Director have approached Goyder Council explaining their financial position and seeking help if they are to continue to lease the Burra Visitor Centre (BVC). When the Trust took over the centre five years ago it had a bank balance of $65,000. This has dwindled and reached a point where if it continues for another year could be in the red. The National Trust would prefer a partnership with the Council rather than the option of not renewing the lease.</p>
<p>Maureen Wright said that in the last four years they have made a minimum annual loss of $10,000 managing the passport and Council owned sites and twice losses have exceeded $30,000. The Trust is seeking $60,000 p.a. to operate the BVC and manage the Council properties. This is about $40,000 more than the current support. The Trust has established a business around the current turnover of $185,000. This involves employing at least 20 casual staff and one full time, with a wage bill of $111,000. Volunteers assist to a total of at least 40 hours per week. The Council has referred the matter to a committee for investigation and a report.</p>
<p>Farrell Flat Centenary of Federation Celebrations took place on Sunday last.

<p>Burra SES has been given approval to move their base to the old ETSA premises on Smelts Road. Since the mid-1980s they have been housed in the old railways goods shed, but they were eager to move because of severe termite infestation of that structure. The building houses two vehicles, a trailer and an office built within the shed. The Council leases the building from Great Southern Railways and sublets it to the SES. The SES contacted the Council some weeks ago, but the Council building inspector said he couldn’t do anything officially and the Council’s line was to contact the SES hierarchy or great Southern Railways. SES members were frustrated over what they saw as a serious safety issue. Because of termite damage:</p>
<p>The floor of the truck bay is sinking</p>
<p>The main door is in danger of falling in</p>
<p>The office, which is only 15 years old is extensively damaged</p>
<p>The wall facing the by-pass road has bowed out due to movement of the foundation and termite damage to the main wall posts</p>
<p>The western wall is in a similar state</p>
<p>The depot has no running water and therefore no showers</p>
<p>The toilet facilities are 100 m away.</p>
<p>The old ETSA building is owned now by the Metropolitan Fire service and SES and MFS members have been preparing it in anticipation of the move.</p>

<p>Susan Parker [of Burra National Trust] writes to correct the impression in the Broadcaster of 21 November that the Burra Branch of the National Trust is seeking financial assistance to cover its losses. The Branch is seeking a realistic contribution from Council towards the cost it incurs in conducting non-Branch related activities on behalf of Council and the wider business community. This includes maintenance of several Council owned sites. The current lease, which expires in 2002, requires the Branch to fully staff and operate the BVC for seven days a week and to maintain Council owned sites to agreed standards. The Council’s current contribution to these activities is about $20,000. If Council should not see its way clear to an increase in its contribution the Branch would have no alternative but to allow responsibility for those activities to revert to Council and to expend its own funds on its own sites and priorities. Council would then discover the actual cost of conducting the said activities.</p>

<p>Redbanks Reserve c. 15 km east of Burra has been formally gazetted as a Conservation Park managed by National Parks and Wildlife SA, Mid North District, Burra.</p>
<p>The reserve contains open grasslands, mallee scrub, saltbush scrubland, deeply eroded creekbeds and deep rock pools. Recently fossil remains of a Tasmanian Tiger and a number of diprotodons have been found there. In the past the area has been intensely grazed as four stock routes converge there and it also saw a period of use by off-road recreational vehicles. The deep gullies were used to dump car bodies. Following a serious accident and the threat of possible litigation Council decided to prohibit motorbikes and off road recreational vehicles. Since then the vegetation has recovered dramatically and with considerable improvement in habitat and wildlife diversity. The former Burra Burra DC spent considerable money clearing the area of old car bodies, with a crushing plant based there for several weeks. The area has been fenced and walking trails created and an informal camping area established. Motorbikes and off road recreational vehicles remain banned.</p>
<p>Adchem is going ahead with plans to produce copper carbonate and anticipates making c. 700 tonnes p.a. They expect demand to rise in 12018 months’ time. The process will be re-using some plant, representing a $500,000 investment. Current staff levels are c. 36, but may be increased later if required.</p>
<p>Burra CWA held its 75th birthday celebrations last December. In January at the Australia Day Celebrations the President Eunice Baker presented a donation of $7,000 to the Burra Cultural Centre Committee to be spent on upgrading and refurbishment of the proposed Mary Warnes Meeting Room at Burra Town Hall. Mary Warnes founded the CWA in SA at Burra in December 1926.</p>

<p>Burra Show is facing difficulties with rising costs. Show President Ron Shipard said the insurance costs, including Public Liability, will double from 2001 levels and these places in doubt the society’s ability to continue. He hopes a solution can be found. A recent survey showed public liability claims have increased from 55,000 to 88,000 a year. Premiums have risen by up to 500%. The problem is especially serious for many small businesses and adventure tourism in particular. Fetes and fairs are also severely threatened.</p>

<p>Elders Jazz in the Monster Mine attracted a large number of visitors from outside the district as well as local residents on Saturday. The 400 tickets were sold out early on the day of the event. The weather was cool, but kind. The event was planned for an area beside the Mine Pool following the announcement of the last Twilight Jazz Affair at Tilley’s Petherton Homestead. Sponsorship was obtained from Elders, SA Tourism Commission and T &amp; R Pastoral and organisers were lucky to obtain the services of Australian jazz trumpet great Bob Barnard and the Adelaide band Eddie White’s Allstars and the Marryatville High School’s Ecstatic Jazz. [Photo.] Organisers are encouraged to hold the event again next year.</p>

<p>The Pascoe Collection of stud merino sheep photographs has been displayed in the Burra Town Hall. It is on permanent loan from the SA Stud Merino Sheepbreeders’ Association. Max Rayner will officially open the display on Monday 18 March. The merino stud display was developed by Richard Pascoe, a Burra hairdresser, who began collecting photographs and other related items in 1910, which he then displayed on the walls of his shop. This proved to be a good marketing ploy. The first contributor was L.W. Gebhardt and others soon followed his example. Among notable visitors to the collection was Prime Minister Bruce in 1925. One of the party, Senator R.V. Wilson, presented a set of photographs of stud rams of SA, NSW and Tasmania. They had previously been part of a display at the Wembley Exhibition in London. In recent times the collection was scattered around the town. The National Trust has had the bulk of the collection for some time. Some items needed restoration and the SA Stud Merino Sheepbreeders’ Association has generously offered to arrange for this. Apart from the official opening of the Merino Heritage Display on 18 March there will be other items on display and Elders will host a barbecue at the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Old Kelvale is featured as a new stud at this year’s 2002 Stud Merino Field Days. Graham &amp; Judy Kellock and David and Jane Hill are running the new entity, born out of a half share in the Kelvale Stud. The Old Kelvale display at Burra Oval will contain a selection of 11⁄2-year-old rams and a selection of ewes so visitors can see the type of sheep they aim to breed. The Kellock family has been breeding merinos and lately poll merinos in the Burra district for 125 years. In 1962 they started breeding rams and registered the Kelvale Stud in 1966. Their aim is to retain the size, structure and wool cutting ability for which the bloodline is known, while continuing to improve wool style and micron. [2 photos.]</p>

<p>The Pascoe Collection was opened for viewing at the Town Hall on Monday evening. It was opened by Max Rayner, the last remaining member of the management committee that bought the collection of stud sheep photographs. The photos featured studs from the early twentieth century. Three bloodlines dominated in those days: Murray, Bungaree and Koonoona. They gave rise to sheep known as the SA type. Other names of note were Hawker’s Anama, Henry Collins’ Lucernedale, Gebhardt’s Mokota, Mortlock’s Martindale and John Collins’ Collinsville. John Collins and his son Arthur (Fatty) ran the stud, making a name for themselves and getting world record prices for sheep around WWI and in the 1920s.</p>

<p>The renovations to the Council Offices are underway with stage 1 on the north side of the building likely to be completed in June. The present offices will then move to the north side while the main meeting room area is completed on the south side. The present doors to the RSL rooms will be filled in and the main entrance to the building will be through the present Council door. The angled reception desk will then be to the left as you enter with staff offices along the northern wall. There is a central private interview room and general office area where the Civic Centre was. A garden bed will be established outside the window facing the creek. Of the $700,000 to be spent on the project, about $100,000 will be for air conditioning.</p>

<p>Farrell Flat Airport</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to upgrade Farrell Flat Airport with lighting and an extended sealed runway to serve the Clare Valley, Gilbert Valley and the Burra Region. Local supporter Adrian Smith of Farrell Flat Ashmore Engineering met with Rob Kerin MP to explain the advantages. The proposal involves an extension of the runway from 560 m to 1,400 m. The extension would take it from the Clare &amp; Gilbert Valley Council area into the Regional Council of Goyder’s area. Both Councils have given in principle support. The nearest airfields are Whitwarta, west of Balaklava; Gawler, 64 nautical miles south and Jamestown to the north. The upgrade would benefit flying schools and agricultural operators and could help break into the overseas air tourist market.</p>
<p>The Farrell Flat-Mintaro Road has recently been sealed. The opening of the improvement to what had been a horror stretch of road was celebrated by the Mintaro School students riding their bicycles from Mintaro to Farrell Flat Airport hangar for what was promoted as the longest morning tea.</p>

Over 1,400 passed through the Town Hall and the new venue of St Mary’s Parish Hall. The committee and the National Trust decided against fire engine rides this year on account of safety concerns, but the Model T was a static display at St Mary’s and the Diamond T was in Market Square.</p>

<p>The Burra Town Hall upgrade project has been boosted by £71,500 from the Federal Government’s Regional Assistance Program. It is part of a £180,000 package sought by the Burra Cultural Centre Committee.</p>
<p>In the scheme the kitchen is to be refurbished with a gas oven, mains water, a dishwasher and a room is to be fitted out for seminars. Stage lighting and controls are to be brought up to date, the stage gets new curtains and the projector room is updated. Access is to be made for those with disabilities with ramps and exterior lighting to the front of the building. The committee has looked at promotion, marketing, event co-ordination and joint marketing with the Art Gallery. The member for Grey Barry Wakelin said the Town Hall is a significant architectural landmark in a town of historical regional importance and the program will help to revitalise the town and attract a range of tourism activities. It is aimed also to increase usage for such events as weddings, conferences and conventions.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>The editor draws attention to a Council decision last year to double the public liability insurance cover needed by local clubs and organisations undertaking activities requiring Council consent from 10 to 20 million dollars. This will raise premiums by 50 to 80% and he questions the need for this ‘excessive knee-jerk reaction’.</p>

<p>The Heysen Trail is being re-routed to avoid Princess Royal Station and ‘The Gap’ south of Burra, following a series of events leading to landowners stopping walkers from crossing their properties. As a temporary measure walkers can follow the old Adelaide Road. A new route is being planned by section maintenance leader Hugh Greenhill.</p>
<p>Some people have been walking out of season during fire ban periods and others have been leaving the trail and creating a nuisance. David Gebhardt told police of walkers with two large dogs travelling through and then of finding 18 sheep dead a week later from what appeared to be dog attacks, some 300 m from the trail. Walkers have also been leaving the trail and interfering with farm buildings. Simon Rowe, owner of Princess Royal, also complains of a lot of people entering Princess Royal from Burra Creek Gorge, which is not part of the Heysen Trail. Owners are bothered by people wishing to ride motor cycles through their property and are also concerned about public liability considerations. Mr Greenhill said that in 20 years this was the most serious problem they had had in running the Heysen Trail. He was sure solutions would be found that would suit landowners and walkers. This year is the Year of the Outback, which has seen increased numbers of walkers on both the Heysen and Mawson Trails. The trail was extensively surveyed along the length of its course from the tip of Fleurieu Peninsula to the Upper Flinders Ranges in 2000. The State Government hold public liability insurance for landowners traversed by the trail for 500 m either side of the trail. The police at Burra have reports of disturbances at Burra Creek Gorge camping area recently involving reckless motor cycle riding and the trashing on a nearby unoccupied farmhouse. The Gorge is crown land controlled by Goyder Council.</p>
<p>Burra Visitor Numbers are up compared with the previous three years.</p>
<p>In January to March 3,838 went through the Visitor Centre compared with 3,100 in 2001, 3,090 in 2000 and 2,824 in 1999. Word of mouth is reported to be the most common way they found out about Burra. While many find the Heritage Trail the highlight, others are attracted to the Cemetery Tour, Artists and Antiques Trail, Ryan’s Deer Farm, the Cider cellars and Burra Trail Rides. The surrounding attractions of Burra Creek Gorge, Mongolata Gold Mines and Redbanks Conservation Park are also proving popular.</p>

<p>Guest speaker for the evening was Kerry Spackman, manager of Clare Valley Tourism Marketing. She spoke of her role and the establishment of a regional visitor information centre. The preferred site for this is near the entrance to the Clare Caravan Park. This would not affect the Burra Visitor Information Centre and they would not be seeking funds from the Goyder Council area. Some people mentioned that their best marketing tool had been the magazine Burra and Beyond, but it was almost out of print. Kerry said that Clare Valley Marketing had no funds to reprint it and it was not encouraging Goyder Council to do so either. It was a similar product to the Clare Valley Secrets publication which had a print run of 80,000 this year. Local operators said they had experienced difficulty getting copies – the Burra Visitor Centre originally got only 50 a month, but now that had been increased to 200. Kerry suggested there could be a series of brochures, perhaps with the general title Burra and the East.</p>
<p>Hallett Railway Station has been renovated to improve accommodation for walkers on the Heysen Trail. It was originally converted in 1992 when bunks, a pot-belly stove, sink and toilet were installed. Now a rainwater tank has been installed, an interior wall knocked down, changes made to the plumbing and a coat of paint applied.</p>
<p>Other sites in the area are also getting some attention. Mt Bryan East School will be inspected and shelters along the White Hill Road and Caroona Creek will be improved. The trail comes from Willalo through Hallett to the summit of Mt Bryan and then to the Mt Bryan East School to Tooralie Gorge and south to Caroona Creek before turning back through the hills along White Hill Road.

Office bearers elected for the year are: President, Faye Jones; Secretary, Jenny Coatupe and Treasurer, Pat Kakoschke. The outgoing Secretary Jan Tiver said the branch members were disheartened to find the Baby Capsule Hire facility has been removed from Burra – especially on top of the closure of the Blood Bank – all apparently in the name of cost effectiveness. During the year Joshua Kleinig won our section of the Baby Competition, raising a very creditable $9,690. Red Cross calling in March was a success, raising $1,731.20. A 20-year badge was awarded to Pat Kakoschke and 10-year badges to M. Simpson, L. Ryan and J. Tiver.</p>

<p>The Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board has launched its Management Plan, which will help in the management of the land, plants and animals. It was launched at Redbanks Conservation Park, just to the east of Burra by Ian Grierson from the Soil Conservation Council. There were about 60 guests and Ian Falkenberg, Senior Wildlife Ranger spoke on the social history of the area and the natural history of the reserve. Redbanks lies at the intersection of two major stock routes and in the past up to 20,000 sheep would pass through this permanent watering site. In 1968 the area was designated a national park reserve. Over the years it became known in SA for its off road motorbike action and camping and when the Burra Burra DC took it over it gave them a difficult management job with its somewhat complex mix of issues, including water rights. The Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board has recently obtained a $97,000 grant to work on the eradication of box thorns between Redbanks and Caroona.</p>

<p>Burra Visitor Centre</p>
<p>The National Trust’s lease expires at the end of the year and it is unwilling to renew the lease following significant financial losses over a number of years. Goyder Council has refused to commit further funding without demonstrated financial support from the community. Without such support there is real danger the centre could close at the end of the year and BRTBA President Sue Ryan said they felt that would be extremely detrimental to the community. The Council has a working party under Andrew Gebhardt to find a solution. Mrs Ryan said the Burra Tourism Association expressed in principle support for taking a share of the management role of the centre. Elly Nicholls and Michael Hamilton have been staffing the centre during the week in recent times. Michael, the present manager, has just accepted a position with the Victor Harbor City Council as Tourism Marketing Officer, beginning in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>[In this article the editor wonders about the dangers inherent in the Council Ward system in promoting parochialism and division.

<p>A Landcare Conference at Clare last Wednesday included travel by coach to ‘The Gums’ to see a demonstration of boxthorn removal by Rick Hastings of Boxthorn Removals Port Victoria, using a converted 4WD tractor with high clearance and large tyres to minimise damage to other vegetation. The bush is lifted vertically out of the ground with little disturbance to surrounding growth. Smaller bushes can also be clumped together and heaped in a pile for burning. So far the Eastern Districts Soil Conservation Board Executive has organised a clearing program involving twelve properties and some 400 tractor hours of work. Pepper trees can also be targeted – though in the absence of rain only small ones. Mechanical removal of pepper trees seems to be better than chemical attack.</p>

<p>BRTBA expressed its interest in running the Burra Visitor Centre at a public meeting at Burra last Wednesday night. After discussing it with members the week before, BRTBA President Sue Ryan said they could not stand by and see its services lost to Burra. Enquiries were made to the Council by individuals, but no interest was shown at the meeting. The centre generates income by selling souvenir products, taking a commission on booked accommodation and by selling the Burra Passport for its owners, the National Trust and the Goyder Council. It provides a general information service for the district. The National Trust lease expires at the end of the year and National Trust SA has been uncomfortable about losses made by the Burra Branch in recent years and the Goyder Council has been asked to contribute, but was unwilling. The working party has been looking at financial figures, which show the National Trust made losses in the middle years of its five year lease, but made a marked profit in the last twelve months.</p>

<p>Des Woolley writes expressing concern about the possible closure of the Visitor Centre and condemning the Council due to:</p>
<p>Its lack of response to correspondence</p>
<p>Its pointless delays with building permits etc.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory gutters and rural access roads</p>
<p>The squandering of money on offices</p>
<p>The excess numbers of highly paid staff.</p>
<p>Doug Wiltshire writes expressing dissatisfaction with a not very helpful report from the Working Party on the Visitor Centre and also with the apparent inability of the National Trust to say whether the operation was now running satisfactorily or not – though they had lost $70,000 in five years. They could not supply profit and loss accounts for the last year or indeed for the previous five year period.</p>
<p>Neither did the new association (BRTBA) present any business plan or financial documentation to inspire confidence.</p>
<p>Other questions showed that the initial operation was very successful and only required $7,000 from Council each year and won several awards.</p>
<p>Also, why would an operator of the Centre elect to maintain all the properties and assets involved in the tourist trail? Surely this is the responsibility of the Council, which has an obligation to seek funding from State and Federal sources to assist. Why should local ratepayers preserve heritage assets on behalf of all Australian citizens?</p>

<p>Ron Edwards writes in response to Dr Cross’s letter last week urging the banning of the discussion of creationism in Burra:</p>
<p>Open discussion of ideas is surely a right of people in Australia. ‘If creation is such a “dangerous belief” then surely all the correctly trained students will spot the flaws in the creation arguments. I invite one and all to come (Sat. 31st Aug. 7 p.m.) and consider both points of view for themselves.’</p>
<p>Burra National Trust held its AGM recently and Chairman Maureen Wright presented a report of the Trust’s activities over the 2002-02 year:</p>
<p>This has been the final year of our lease agreement with the Goyder Council during which we have managed the Burra Visitor Centre, the Council’s Heritage Sites, the Heritage Trail and our own sites. A total of about 20 properties and buildings. Being solely in charge has in some ways been easier, but it is also a great responsibility and our committee feels it is time to give the community a greater chance to become involved with the Burra Visitor Centre. The Council’s working party has devised a strategic plan for the Burra Visitor centre and will be recommending to Council that BRTBA is the best body to take over management of the Burra Visitor Centre. Being freed from Burra Visitor Centre management will allow the National Trust once more to focus on conservation and preservation issues and development of the properties for which we are responsible.</p>

<p>Doug Wiltshire writes quite a long letter to draw attention to the habit of Goyder Council of undertaking private contracts – citing earthworks for the Bower Piggery as an example. He points out that this practice is contrary to the Trades Practices Act Section 4G, dealing with the Lessening of Competition or preventing or hindering competition. There is a similar problem with Section 45, which prohibits the Council from making contracts that would substantially lessen competition and similar restrictions are imposed unde sections 46 &amp; 47.</p>

<p>The Visitor Centre Working Party has recommended offering a lease of the Visitor Centre to BRTBA from 1 January 2003, with the Council making an annual contribution of $35,000 towards the running of the centre. The Council has agreed with an amendment that the Council’s contribution be reduced by $2,500 p.a. after the first year, to reach $25,000 in 2007. The Association has expressed its ‘in principle’ support and was willing to have representatives on a board of management, together with those of Goyder Council and the National Trust, who have vital interests as owners of the Burra Passport Key Tour, but it wants a review after 12 months and the roles of all parties to be negotiated. It asked for any losses to be under-written by the Council, which was not a working party recommendation. The working party expected the Centre to have an income of $30,000 from 30% of the Passport sales and $35,000 from Council and $5,000 generated from BRTBA membership.</p>

<p>Little income has been derived by Council from the asset.</p>
<p>Offers from $75,000 were made.</p>
<p>Some Councillors had concerns re access to the sale yards.</p>
<p>5 allotments were then withdrawn.</p>
<p>The remainder were offered for sale.</p>
<p>He believes at least on offer for $50,000 was made – which was the asking price.</p>
<p>On 20 June 2000 Mr McBride was allowed to use the site to wash down his trucks. (Previously done at my front gate.)</p>
<p>This would seem to contravene EPA requirements that the washing down area be paved and water run-off be collected in a pit, from which waste can be recovered. This is still not being done.</p>
<p>Negotiations began with Mr McBride in January 2001 and remained confidential to April 2002.</p>
<p>A minute on 15 May 2001 said Councillors agreed the land was to go to public consultation as the first step to exclude it as Community Land – never done due to the obsession of Council to maintain confidentiality.</p>
<p>This is contrary to Council policy.</p>
<p>Council seems to have taken advantage of a loop-hole re consultation, by claiming it does not come under the new LGA Act (1999), because it was offered for sale prior to this Act.</p>
<p>In February 2002 Council voted to accept an offer from A. McBride for the exchange of six vacant allotments in Cooper and Taylor Streets and to subdivide off three hectares of land next to the cemetery, to enable expansion of the cemetery and Council has confirmed it is paying for all subdivision and survey costs.</p>
<p>If the cemetery area was a bargaining chip, then one must ask why the Council did not use compulsory acquisition powers to obtain that.</p>
<p>Mr McBride has been able to use the O’Connor’s site rent free in the interim.</p>
<p>The final agreement involves no cash adjustment, but the McBride land has been valued at only $15,000 and the O’Connor’s Shed and land at $75,000 some years ago – involving the Council in a loss of $60,000.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t the property simply auctioned as it should have been?</p>
<p>On 25 March 2002 permission was given for Mr McBride to erect a residence on the truck depot site, but this was a non-complying land use and so public consultation should have occurred.</p>
<p>I have been assured that all appropriate fees for this development have been paid, but such fees do not appear in the register and Council says it did not consider the development o be non-complying.</p>
<p>My experience has been very different.</p>
<p>Council provided ballast from the railway station and spread it at the truck depot at no cost.</p>
<p>Council denies sealing 700 m of road in front of Mr McBride’s house as part of the deal.</p>
<p>This work was not included in the published works program of 2002-03.</p>
<p>Mr Wiltshire says he takes no issue with McBride’s, other than to inform and illustrate the facts of the case to ratepayers, who have a right to know. He makes no inference of wrong-doing by them, but he does take issue with all Councillors and Council administration however, whom he feels owe ratepayers an explanation.</p>

<p>Editorial by Terry Wilson on the Burra Show.</p>
<p>While commending the show, Terry suggests it may need to change as years go by to avoid dwindling crowds and perhaps some inventive minds are needed. He throws in a few thoughts:</p>
<p>Would a different time of year be better? For example could it be linked to the Merino Field Days and if so could it use the Field Days marquees at the oval, rather than the existing showgrounds?</p>
<p>Could a Saturday night headline entertainer be a boost? Wirrulla did it with Kasey Chambers. Perhaps with a ute muster beforehand.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to change the word ‘show’ and would ‘fair’, ‘field day’ or ‘expo’ have more appeal?</p>
<p>Could the focus be better fixed on livestock and mixed farming?</p>

<p>Adchem’s Copper carbonate Plant has been opened. Part of their plant has been refitted with the addition of three additional process vessels to increase the potential production of copper carbonate to more than 3,000 tonnes p.a. Total investment in the new plant is more than $1.8 million and it will employ a further eight people, including two apprentices. Michael Hillman starts soon as an apprentice electrician and Ben Jones as an apprentice boilermaker. This brings Adchem staff to 43, up from the 30 of a couple of years ago. Adchem operates the largest single plant producing copper oxide in the world. Copper carbonate is an industrial form of malachite, making an unusual link with the original Burra mining operation. Copper oxide is mainly used in the timber preservation industry in the copper chrome arsenate (CCA) preservative. It is exported to more than 20 countries and Adchem expects ultimately to send copper carbonate to most of them too. About one in four treated posts in the world contains copper oxide from Adchem’s Burra operation. [Photo.]</p>
<p>Goyder Council has agreed to lease the Burra Visitor Centre to BRTBA for two years. For the National Trust, this leaves the way clear for negotiations on the management of Council owned sites. The Trust is proposing to lease Council’s tourism sites (excluding the Visitor Centre) for the price of the Council’s share of the Burra Passport. This will be considered at the November meeting of Council. If there is no agreement, the Trust will revert to managing its own sites after 31 December 2002.</p>

<p>The Pens Family have given a wooden doll to the Burra National Trust.

The Pens family (Vida, Jack and children) lived at Bendigo, where Jack Pens was the manager. Sam was much loved and had a rather hard life, which included several changes of clothes over the years.

<p>The Drought continues to provide stories of hardship.</p>
<p>Richard and Jan Riggs went out to Murkaby last Tuesday 22 October to draft sheep. Richard said it was the worst day he had experienced with gale force winds all day until 3 p.m. when a change arrived. He was at that time taking a flock of ewes back to the paddock and they were just five metres in front of him when they completely vanished in raised dust. He waited in a gateway for the dust to subside a little. Nearby there was a dam which he did not want them to go to, but where he expected to find them, but when conditions eased slightly they had not moved during the squall and were still five metres ahead of him.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon he went to clean out a trough, but had to abandon the idea because of the quantity of dust and stones being hurled about in the wind. The next day when he returned the trough was so full of dirt that the float was unable to drop down to admit the water. It made him recall the 1967 drought when he was lamb marking and could not seek Brian Woodman who was working on the other side of the fence from him. There are also masses of emus out there, from Baldina to Murkaby.</p>

<p>Questions to Council by the Burra Broadcaster</p>
<p>Was the sealing of the surface behind the Commercial Hotel part of normal work? It was undertaken to overcome drainage and road maintenance issues.</p>
<p>Was the office upgrade really needed? Were there viable alternatives? The upgrade was needed. Alternative sites in Burra were considered and Council looked at separating the office and the meeting room. Occupational health and safety issues and public access concerns led to the decision to remain in Market Square.</p>
<p>What is happening with Paxton Square? Interim managers have an extension of their contract to June 2003. In the meantime management has been working on upgrading the Kingston Street Row. A decision on the future management structure has been deferred.</p>
<p>The Melbourne Cup Luncheon organised by the Burra Hospital Auxiliary is noted with a photograph of five who attended.</p>
<p>O’Connor’s Shed [Drew &amp; Crewe’s Bulk Store] at Burra North.</p>
<p>Council is going through the process of declassifying community land associated with this site. In 1999 all Council owned land was deemed community land by an Act of Parliament. The State Ombudsman has advised that the land associated with the sale of O’Connor’s Shed must be re-classified before and sale could be considered. At its meeting on 19 February Council moved that it accept from A.P. &amp; K.L. McBride vacant land at Cooper Street and Taylor Street Burra North, along with land at Jaffrey St Burra and that it sell to A.P. &amp; K.L. McBride the property of O’Connor’s Shed and truck parking area at West Street and Hardy Street. Mc Brides were to be given a permit for the exclusive use of Hardy Street, Burra for five years. A number of allotments in Jaffrey Street were to be given to A.P. &amp; K.L. McBride on an annual rental basis. A community Consultation is in process regarding the declassification of this community land with submissions to be received up to 14 November. A purchase offer for this shed was made from the Ngadjuri group of people earlier, but this fell through due to lack of funds. Other offers have been made, but none were pursued.</p>
<p>Burra Swimming Pool has been repaired in readiness for the coming swimming season. The pool is now slowly being filled, which should take about a week. It is planned to open it on 22 November, temperature permitting. The Swimming Club has added another shade area.</p>
<p>Weather</p>
<p>A local thunderstorm on 29 October resulted in the CFS attending six reported fires. One strike at 6.45 p.m. was just south of Burra, a call out east proved to be a false alarm. Another was on Princess Royal Station. Farrell Flat CFS attended two fires and the Booborowie and Mt Bryan units one each.</p>
<p>On 2 November lightning started a fire northeast of Burra in the hills on the property of Hamish Baker.

<p>Cynthia Fleming – daughter of Eileen Fleming (nee Gosling) writes re the report of the opening of Gosling Cottage on Sunday 13 October:</p>
<p>The report said Mrs Gwenyth Mosey nee Gosling was a daughter of Mr Arthur Gosling, but she was a granddaughter. Mr Arthur Gosling, who first worked for the previous owners from 1892, bought the business in 1907. He also had stores at Pt Wakefield and Halbury. His eldest son Percival Arthur Gosling took over the management from his father in 1910 and later purchased the business. Arthur Edward Gosling moved to Adelaide. Percival Arthur Gosling moved from Pt Wakefield at this time. Mrs Gwen Mosey nee Gosling who cut the ribbon was born in the cottage in December 1911 as was a son Rex Percival in 1915 and the family lived in the cottage from 1910 to 1919, when Percival sold the business and moved to Waikerie to take up a fruit orchard. Mrs Eileen Fleming nee Gosling and Mrs Gwenyth Mosey nee Gosling are the only surviving members of the family who resided in the cottage, their brother having died in 1991.</p>

<p>Remembrance Day was commemorated in Burra by a good crowd on Monday at 11 a.m., including students from BCS. [Photo.]</p>
<p>Redruth Camping Centre will close after 30 years of operation. There will be a commemorative service there on Sunday 17 November at 11 a.m. The camp was the vision of the Rev. Clarrie Hore, when the Redruth Methodist Church closed in 1970. The Redruth church played an important part in many people’s lives. The Sunday school building was erected in 1924 and the Redruth Camping Centre opened in 1972 in the Sunday school building. Among those involved then were Barry Eberhard and Brian Thamm, who have had an ongoing involvement. The conversion needed only minor kitchen works and rewiring. A government employment scheme carried out some earthwork and built a retaining wall between the centre and the manager’s residence. The camping centre worked well in the 1970s. Many campers arrived by train and walked to the centre. In 1980 the old Courthouse Hotel was bought (involving a loan). The hotel had many licensees in its 63 years as a hotel from 1853 to 1921 and after that it was at times a nursing home, a wood yard, garage and a private home. After its purchase in 1980, it was for a time the Tiddy ʼoggey Tea Room and then a craft shop before being incorporated into the camping centre. It required much cleaning out and renovation. During those years it had extensive vegetable gardens and served as a community centre. Rev. Brian Polkinghorne was then in charge and managed camps at the camping centre across the road. In 1983 Helen McColl was appointed manager and has carried on the job superbly for almost twenty years. In 1986 the old hotel was incorporated fully into the Camping Centre and was used by small groups capable of doing their own catering. During this time the camping centre was occupied for up to 5,000 bed nights per year. In 1989 the synod took over the management of the centre, with bookings managed from Adelaide and many camps were steered our way. This resulted in a large number of camps, which continued to 1995. The management was then handed back to the local church. Complete packages were organised and teachers just needed to supply supervision. For the six years 1995-2000 some 19,120 bed nights were provided – and numbers were higher in previous years.</p>
<p>But in the 1990s the number and size of camps fell due to a variety of causes:</p>
<p>Bus costs for students increased.</p>
<p>Teachers became more reticent to take camps due to liability issues.</p>
<p>Sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road made it more dangerous for camps involving both sides of the road.</p>
<p>Administration costs rose, including having to link fire alarms to the MFS in Burra.</p>
<p>Changes were made to the administration in 2001 and there was some hope that Flinders University might use it as a base for various archaeological enterprises, but the centre has run for some years with annual losses of up to $10,000, with the gap being met from the Burra Op Shop and general parish funds. Many people have contributed to the centre over the years. Helen McColl often went beyond what could reasonably be asked in maintenance and operation and there were ongoing contributions from Brian Thamm and Barry Eberhard and from further afield – Reg Sutton (Booborowie(, Ian Denton (Farrell Flat) and Joyce Lommon (Mt Bryan). The service on 17 November will acknowledge all who contributed and will celebrate its role in the community.</p>

<p>A Fire southeast of Booborowie on Sunday 17 November was tackled by seven CFS units and a host of farm vehicles. The fire apparently started when a header hit a stone. About 250 acres were burnt, destroying some $23,000 worth of barley and valuable sheep and cattle feed as well as several kilometres of fencing. It was an unusual fire in that it extended along fingers of flame driven by whirlwinds in the area.</p>
<p>Regional Council of Goyder; Burra Office Open Day</p>
<p>The recently refurbished Burra Office drew a good crowd on Sunday 17 November. Chairman Denis Keller welcomed visitors who included the recently elected President of the Local Government Association, Mr Max Amber, representatives from neighbouring Councils, Councillors and their wives and members of the public. When amalgamation formed the Council in 1997 the need to upgrade the Burra office was on the agenda of the first meeting. A safety audit revealed several areas of concern: there were problems with access, fire safety, staff safety and a lack of storage facilities. A sub-committee visited other Councils to gather ideas and also consulted with staff and with the Burra RSL. Designs were drawn up and fee proposals were invited. Shannon Architects were selected to manage the project and Partek Industry Pty Ltd won the contract, with work starting on 19 March 2002.</p>
<p>In Stage 1 the old RSL room and the rear Council offices and old Council Chamber were gutted and rebuilt to house the administration area. This meant considerable adjustment by staff who for a time had even less space and a good deal of noise and dust to contend with. During this phase Council meetings were held in the Burra Town Hall.</p>
<p>Stage 2 began on 1 July 2002, with staff now relocated to the new administration area and work began on the new Council Chamber, kitchen facilities and foyer. This was completed on 8 November and is expected to come in within Council budgets.</p>
<p>The result has given staff greatly improved conditions.</p>
<p>The RSL has more comfortable facilities and the Ladies’ Auxiliary is better accommodated for indoor bowls.</p>
<p>Mr Max Amber said he was impressed with the outcome, which gives offices of a standard equal to any in the state. Len Simpson represented the RSL and thanked the Council, saying that the RSL was very pleased with the refurbishment, which displays the honour boards in the main Council Chamber.</p>

<p>Burra Swimming Pool has undergone some major maintenance. Filters were overhauled and a hole in the concrete surface was patched. Vandalism has hindered progress through the winter, but the pool is now slowly filling and it is hoped it will be filled and the water quality stable in time for an opening next Saturday. Its season will run to Sunday 2 March 2003 and longer if the weather is favourable. Hours of operation will be 3.00 to 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 to 9.00 p.m. (Temperature dependent.) During school holidays and at weekends it will open at 2.00 p.m. Session charges are $3 and for children and students under 18, $2. Family tickets are $180 per season or $70 per month. The pool only opens if the advertised temperature for Pt Pirie is 28°C or higher and for night sessions 32°C or higher. [Further details are printed.]</p>

<p>John Agnew of the Burra Uniting Church writes to clarify the reason for closing the Redruth Camping Centre. He says it was not because of costs associated with fire regulations, but rather the declining number of campers.</p>
<p>Tiffany Chapman, Project Manager for the Burra Cultural Centre (the Town Hall) writes to thank all who made the National Trust SA Heritage and The Outback Conference such a great success on the 8-10 November. Organisers and attendees gave the event rave reviews. They were especially appreciative of the different locations available, the way the catering facilities were shared among a variety of groups and the general warmth of the locals.</p>
<p>Goyder Council CEO Steve Kerrigan writes in response to recent letters published from Mr Douglas Wiltshire, which make serious allegations against the Council:</p>
<p>So far Council has avoided responding to these matters in the belief they should be resolved through the channels established under legislation, but the latest notice published on 13 November has forced this response to totally reject his inferences against the integrity and performance of my staff.</p>
<p>Mr Wiltshire has referred over 30 issues to both the Ombudsman and the Minister of Local Government over a two month period, involving significant staff time on almost a daily basis. Council recognises its duty to respond to reasonable requests for information and clarification of issues placed before Council. However, the number of requests and responses required is becoming unmanageable and is in danger of infringing on the ability to provide those services to the community required by the Local Government Act. Most issues raised are either within the discretion of Council or are matters the Council considers to be entirely without foundation and which will be defended in court by Council if necessary. Anyone interested in changing the Council’s direction should consider discussing issues with current elected members.</p>
<p>The Burra Regional Art Gallery’s Annual Art of the Flower Exhibition for 2002 attracted more than double the number of entries for 2001. 68 pieces of art have been hung and they were complemented by displays of floral art over the weekend of 15-17 November. A good crowd attended the opening on 15 November. The $500 prize went to Jacqueline Coates of Kapunda for her 1.2 m square oil on canvas entitled Sunflowers from my garden. The judge was Linda Waldrum who has a Degree in Fine Arts and has moved to Burra from Queensland in recent months. The curator was Carol Hancock.</p>

<p>Redruth Camp Centre Closes</p>
<p>A service was held on 17 November to mark the closure of the Redruth Camp Centre. People from Burra Uniting Church and from Farrell Flat and Booborowie gathered to witness its closing after 30 years. Among the visitors who had been actively involved over the years were Neil &amp; Debbie Brown, Harold &amp; Sandra Bailey and Ian &amp; Jenny Denton. Rod Peppiatt conducted the service. The centre was inaugurated in 1972 and served as a retreat and a camp centre for church and school groups. The Tiddy-oggy Tearooms were another part of the story in the former Courthouse Hotel. Up to 80 could be accommodated there when other facilities were full. There were good catering facilities on either side of the road. Rod Peppiatt highlighted the service given by Helen McColl for more than 20 years as manager-caretaker. The Uniting Church is considering options for the disposal of the asset. The Courthouse Hotel site could be converted to three flats. The rest of the complex comprises three sites: the Redruth Church, the manager’s residence and the Camp Centre, formerly the Sunday-school building.

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>Burra Community Development Program and Burra Cultural Centre Committee have managed to obtain grants to upgrade the Town Hall. The Regional Assistance Program grant has allowed the appointment of a Project Manager, Tiffany Chapman. The aim is to increase hall use by expanding the range of functions that the hall can accommodate. Paul Williams has been appointed Manager of the Burra Community Internet Centre, which will be located in the Hall. Burra CWA has generously assisted the refurbishment of one of the front rooms. This was officially opened in November as the Mary Warnes Room in honour of the founder of the CWA in SA, who was a district resident. As well as being used by the CWA for its monthly meetings, it is available as a seminar, training or small meeting room for up to 20 people.</p>
<p>The kitchen has also been upgraded with a six-burner commercial gas oven and a commercial dishwasher. Storage facilities will be increased with two lockable cupboards under the gallery stairs. Quotes are being obtained for a new set of stage curtains and upgrading of the stage lighting. Live performances have declined in recent years, in part due to substandard facilities.</p>
<p>The room that is being transformed into the Internet Centre has been emptied, repainted, rewired and carpeted and will be air-conditioned. It is intended to extend cabling to the Mary Warnes Room and the Main Hall, offering Internet, Email and data projection facilities to hirers. The BCC has also been working on developing a Volunteer Team for the Hall. These people would:</p>
<p>Act as guides for tourists in the display and museum areas</p>

<p>Pearce’s Building</p>
<p>Following the recent claim by a visitor that the last direct descendant of the Pearce Family associated with Pearce’s Buildings had died; we have had correspondence from a number of descendants to contradict the claim. Miss Mary Pearce wrote to us and then Tom Dearlove wrote as one of six remaining grandchildren. He included some information about the building:</p>
<p>It was built in 1915* to secure the financial future of his unmarried daughters. It comprised an office block in Commercial Street with suites to hire and a nice little hall 33 ft x 26 ft at the rear. Soon after completion the hall was in demand for all sorts of fund-raising events associated with the Great War and was regularly used by the Burra Cheer-Up Ladies’ Band for practice. John Pearce died in 1927 and in 1929 [January 1930] the building was badly damaged by fire, but was restored.</p>
<p>[*It was built in 1914 and ready to let in 1915:</p>

<p>Pearce’s Buildings are now practically finished. There are two suites of offices on the ground floor, occupied by Mr Winnall and Mr Jeanes, the Federal Division Returning Officer. At the rear is a small hall 33’ x 26’ to be let for meetings, parties etc. Two suites of offices upstairs are yet to be let. The building is most imposing.</p>

<p>Burra’s Christmas Pageant &amp; Carols Night came together for one large Christmas celebration at Burra Oval on Sunday afternoon. In 2002 Father Christmas arrived on a camel. The pageant was led by the Burra Pony Club members on their horses, carrying a star, which the rest of the procession followed. Three wise men came on quad bikes and there followed a van wrapped in red and gold, the nativity, a clown, senior citizens and then other floats and groups. The pageant wound its way around the oval and to the Sports Complex. It was hot and the air conditioning was appreciated. The kids loved the sprinklers at one end of the oval. The prizes for decorated cakes were announced:</p>
<p>2-6 years Tom Wiech</p>

<p>1876 - William Lunn and friend drown in the lagoon while duck shooting. (Lunn was the founder of Spalding and great-grandfather of Burra resident Garth Lunn.</p>
<p>1926 – A syndicate was formed after a meeting at H.C. Atkins’ home, to build a 16 foot clinker boat. People paid 6 pence an hour for a ride on Sundays and Public holidays and 2/6 an hour on other days.</p>
<p>1927 – The boat was christened ‘The Swan’ by Mrs Atkins at a special sports day. A single plank jetty was erected and in late 1927 another boat, ‘The Gull’ was bought. A shed was erected and a ladies only bathing area was declared. Planning began for a regatta for Australia Day 1928.</p>
<p>1928 – The tradition of an Australia Day Regatta kicked off with events that included: bobbing for corks, four oar swim, tub race, 100 yard swim, slippery pole, riding the barrel, 440 yard swim.</p>
<p>1929 – Athletic events were added to the regatta and a dance was held [At Farrell Flat] in the evening.</p>
<p>1930 – With lower water level more athletic events were added along with sheaf tossing.</p>
<p>1937 – The lake was dry and salt was being harvested. At their peak, thousands were attending the regattas. Swings and seesaws were erected on the shore, there was a plentiful supply of cool drinks and ice cream and catering was done in the boat shed.</p>
<p>WWII – When war broke out the boats were sold and moved to Fisherman’s Bay and the other assets were also sold.</p>
<p>1950s – The water returned and water skiing became popular. The Australian Water Skiing Championships were held there and the Pt Adelaide Sailing Club came along.</p>
<p>1970s – Motor boats and water skiing dominated activities. Stockman’s boat burnt and sank.</p>
<p>1993 – The lagoon filled and spread across the highway.</p>
<p>2003 – Presently the lagoon is dry – though a small patch of water may be visible in early morning, only to disappear later. David Kellock recalls it being similar in 1967. Laurel Neill says old folk last recalled it being completely dry in 1914.</p>

<p>Underground Water Supplies in the district have been falling on many farms and owners are having to adjust usage. Barry Eberhard at Mullaby is only able to draw on about a quarter of the usual flow – down from 400 to 120 gallons per hour. East Bungaree reports a serious decline and so do Tony Gebhardt, Bill Gebhardt and Richard Riggs. There has been no significant recharge to underground supplies for eight years or so.</p>

<p>Burra’s Sewage Ponds have been leaking into groundwater and until repairs are effected contractors disposing of liquid waste cannot use them. The solution being put to Council this week is for a PVC liner at a cost of $70,000 and a total cost of $113,000.</p>
<p>The Council is also considering what to do about leakages from the main pond in the centre of town. Compaction of the bed with clay is one option and the elimination of the pond is another. Supplying the water is costing about $20,000 a year to run the electric pump. Council Director of Operations, Peter Boaden, said there could be merit in using a solar powered pump to get water from the mine pool.</p>

<p>The Kingston Street Bridge is to be strengthened with steel beams under the existing superstructure, sitting on new concrete columns and footings. These columns will be at each bank and either side of the existing central piers. The Council is seeking funding for the project, but if this is unsuccessful the matter will be referred to the 2003-04 budget. Transport SA will be asked to impose a load limit of 4 tonnes and a speed limit of 40 km/hr from Market Square to Bridge Terrace to avoid any immediate liability problem. The 35 m wide bowstring bridge was constructed in 1879 to replace the Bridge Street Bridge, carried away by a flood in 1877. The central piers are sunk 12 feet into the ground. The concrete deck was added in 1935. [Photo]</p>

<p>Two Day Manhunt</p>
<p>Burra became the focus of a manhunt for refugees who had escaped from Woomera Detention Centre last week. Local officer Ashleigh Hale noticed a vehicle fitting the description of one being sought at a Kingston Street address on Tuesday. The station wagon left the address soon after 6 p.m. and was pursued at speed along the Morgan Road. It was stopped at gunpoint, but the occupants fled on foot into a saltbush paddock east of the Robertstown turnoff. The driver was arrested. Three of the fugitives were captured on Tuesday night and two others at about 3.30 p.m. Wednesday and the last one later that night. The graffito ‘Freedom for Refugees Now’ was painted across the Kingston Street-Welsh Place intersection and the word ‘Freedom’ was painted on the door of the former Salvation Army Citadel – presumably associated with the same series of events.</p>

<p>Another Bridge Accident</p>
<p>Last Wednesday morning another truck struck the old railway bridge at Burra North. The bridge was moved several centimetres and a large block of concrete weighing well over a tonne fell to the roadway. Council staff cleared away the debris and SES attended. The bridge did not pose any danger to traffic and the road was re-opened. The bridge is 20 cm higher than the maximum allowable height for loads on trucks and so should not prove an obstacle for traffic. Despite this, it has been hit several times in the past couple of years. [Photo]</p>

<p>Letter from Councillor Adrian Gill</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I, along with all other councillors received a ‘notice of intention to commence legal proceedings’ from Douglas Wiltshire, which has not been acted on even though three months have passed.</p>
<p>I intend to stand at the next election and I challenge Mr Wiltshire and others, to also stand and let the electors decide who they want on Council.</p>
<p>This is the letter that the author has since circulated:</p>
<p>Notice of Intention to Commence Legal Proceedings</p>
<p>Notice is hereby given of intention to commence legal proceedings by way of a class action by a number of ratepayers within the regional [sic] Council of Goyder.</p>
<p>The Statement of Claim to be drawn will allege, but will not be restricted to the following claims: - Purported sale of O’Connor’s Shed and purchase of land from A &amp; K McBride. Private Contracting, Office Renovations, Purchase of Equipment, Level of Rates within Burra Township, Funding to National Trust, Various Works Projects, Tendering Procedure and other matters unspecified at this time. The claim will allege:</p>

Ideas were discussed to attract more visitors in the slow months of January and February. Ways of encouraging coaches to visit Burra are needed as well as ways to encourage longer stays.</p>

<p>The Burra Cemetery Committee has just received funds to repair and resite the last of the headstones that have been leaning against the western wall for a number of years. The six remaining historical headstones dating back to the 1870s will be resited. The story goes back to the 1960s when the local Council bulldozed a section of the cemetery plots where the 99-year leases had expired. The rubble and headstones were used as landfill for the Aberdeen tennis courts and the bridge on Ayers Street, but some were rescued by history conscious locals and since then a number have been resited at the cemetery.</p>

<p>Letter from Doug Wiltshire, Burra</p>
<p>‘In response to the letter last week, several matters deserve comment.</p>
<p>Firstly, I did not circulate the Notice referred to. The Notice was photocopied and circulated by an unknown number of Councillors within one day of it’s [sic] receipt by them.</p>
<p>The Notice was marked Private and Confidential and was not intended to be made public, but having been made public by some of the recipients, there was no point in continuing to hold it confidential. Councillor Gill has actually done the community a favour by publishing it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Notice was dated 18 November and served on the following day. Councillors were given 30 days to respond which they chose not to, nevertheless, the period specified was allowed. The Minutes of Council dated 19th November 2002, item 561/02 state “That Council reject the content of the letter received by each Councillor from Mr. D. Wiltshire and that although individual Councillors may seek their own advice, the Chief Executive Officer seek legal advice on the matter.”</p>
<p>Councillor Gill may like to inform ratepayers of the amount expended in legal fees on this and all other matters which have been the subject of my investigation, as there have been many, because this information would be in keeping with Council’s own supposed Policy of open, honest and transparent dealings with ratepayers, but I won’t hold my breath waiting!</p>
<p>Thirdly, Lawyers acting in this matter didn’t return from holidays until end of January 2003, and as there is still considerable evidence to be gathered before formal proceedings can be issued, it may be several months before anything materialises, considering the fact that Council continue to frustrate my efforts to gain vital information under Freedom of Information Requests, as they have done over the past six months.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Councillor Gill and others should be under no illusion that the matter will proceed to Court given all evidence being obtained. The fact that he and others may propose to renominate in the upcoming election is purely up to them, because they know the consequences proposed in the Notice served on them, and it makes no difference to proceedings whether they are in Council or not.</p>

<p>The Old Fire Station Closes</p>
<p>The Market Square Fire Station will close today when the MFS relocates to the old ETSA facility on Smelts Road. At 2 p.m. Ilene Campbell, daughter of the first station foreman,1 and the Council CEO Steve Kerrigan, will officially close the door for the last time. The new location will be shared with the SES. The MFS has been providing fire protection and other emergency services for the township and surrounding community2 continuously for 83 years and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>With the rapid growth of rural support industries and constant threat of fire in the two flour mills3 operating in the Burra township in 1917, the Burra Town Council approached the SA Fire Brigade to provide fire protection to Burra township and the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>With the completion of the Burra Fire Station at Market Square in 19204 came the first petrol driven fire engine to the town and additional protection for residents and industries.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1940s the only method available for alerting fire fighters was the town’s bell5 – today located at Morphett’s Enginehouse. After WWII the town was given permission to use the wartime air raid siren – tested every morning at 7 a.m. until the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Since built, the station has seen two minor additions. A small office, shower and toilet area was added at the back of the building. This office was later enlarged to provide room for the station bed. This was due to a requirement for a fire fighter to be on duty at night to activate the siren from the station after hours. Only in the 1970s did this become unnecessary, when the task could be performed from fire fighters’ homes.</p>
<p>For some years the station has been too small to adequately house the MFS facility and the move will allow for a larger and more modern fire engine.</p>
<p>The Burra National Trust owns the original Model T fire truck [Photo]. It was purchased from an Eyre Peninsula farmer and restored. The Trust also owns two other Burra fire engines – the 1936 Diamond T and the 1948 Dennis, which have done the Bay to Birdwood Run for a number of years.</p>
<p>[1 The first station foreman was H.R. Bosisto, who was appointed early in 1922. He was in charge at least till late 1923. Ilene Campbell’s Father was W.J. Lee, who was certainly one of the firemen, but further research would be needed to see if/when he took over the role of foreman.</p>
<p>2 The idea that the MFS operated outside the Town Council Area, at least until the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils, needs research. The idea that the Town Council would happily fund activities in the District Council area seems unlikely.</p>
<p>3 Butterworth’s Mill operated only between 1874 and 1892.</p>
<p>4 The site for the Fire Station was not approved until early 1922. The building was completed in August 1922, the same week that the Model T Ford fire engine arrived on Thursday 17 August.</p>
<p>5 The fire bell was originally located at the Kooringa Police Station, where it had been for many years. The Town Council passed a resolution to relocate it to the Fire Station in November 1923, though they had only a little earlier considered such a public position was too tempting for misuse.</p>
<p>A siren was installed in 1925.]</p>

<p>Goyder Council has adopted a plan for some redevelopment of the creek area – much of it based on a concept drawn up in 1994. Plans are afoot to use water from the Mine Pool to maintain the creek flow, rather than bore water. A solar pump is being investigated. A walking trail on the west side of the creek, reaching north from the foot bridge could also be included.</p>
<p>The Effluent Ponds</p>
<p>At present the southern ponds are being made into one large pond, to be separated from the northern area, which will become four smaller ponds. A liner will be laid in the larger pond, where the treatment cycle begins, before the effluent is pumped through the remaining four ponds. Council is looking for a customer to use the end product.</p>

<p>Goyder Council is preparing costings and a report on sealing the Bower Boundary Road. This connects the Morgan-Burra Road with the Morgan-Eudunda Road. It provides a link to abattoirs at Murray Bridge and Pt Wakefield and its sealing is regarded as vital to the development of the intensive animal industries and other primary industries in the Bower area. One major pig producer has been established and two additional development applications are being considered. The area could potentially accommodate up to 53 enterprises, with 23 being in the Regional Council of Goyder. The Minister for transport does not support the project when money has recently been spent on sealing the parallel Burra-Robertstown Road.</p>

<p>Railway Track Inspection</p>
<p>Australian Rail Group (ARG) ran a locomotive to Burra and Kapunda last Wednesday to inspect the condition of the track. They wanted to use a heavier vehicle than the usual Toyota inspection ute fitted with small guide wheels.

<p>Story of the Redruth Church</p>
<p>The first mention of Redruth is in the circuit minutes in 1859 and later that year Redruth received from the Government an allocation of 20 acres of glebe land and half an acre in the township in Tregonning Street.1</p>
<p>On 2 February 1851 the cornerstone of the first Redruth Chapel was laid.</p>
<p>The Chapel was opened on 4 May 1851. The building cost £260.</p>
<p>The exodus of men to the Victorian gold rush caused the chapel to fail and in 1854 it was dismantled by the trustees. The roof, floor, windows, doors, pulpit and seats were transferred to the new chapel at Spring Farm near Clare.</p>
<p>In 1856 the Burra Burra Circuit was changed to the Kooringa Circuit, of which Redruth was a part.</p>
<p>There was no chapel at Redruth 1854-57.</p>
<p>In 1857 the Kooringa trustees decided to restore the Redruth Chapel by using old windows, seats, the pulpit and part of the roof made available when the Kooringa Chapel was enlarged. This cost £150.</p>
<p>This second Redruth Chapel was opened on 22 April 1857.</p>
<p>In August 1873 the trustees resolved to build the existing chapel in Ludgvan Street at a cost of £1,310.</p>
<p>The front section of the building was added to the existing building,2 with four foundation stones being laid on Thursday 23 April 1874.</p>
<p>On the Sunday services were held in the Lutheran Church at Redruth by Rev. G.W. Patchell in the morning and afternoon. On Monday a tea meeting was held in the old Redruth Chapel, followed by a public meeting in the Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>At the stone laying and opening ceremonies £400 was raised and the rest was borrowed. The building measured 42 ft x 24 ft and would seat 200. The architect was Mr R. Rees and it was built by Mr James Tiver and Mrs Ann Pearce &amp; Sons.</p>
<p>The trustees then decided to build a Sunday school behind the chapel. This was completed in September 1875 in the form of a T-piece at the back of the chapel at a cost of £300.</p>
<p>For want of room this building was annexed as a transept for the church at a later date.3</p>
<p>The Sunday school was transferred to Jubilee Hall 4 – the former Primitive Methodist Chapel.</p>
<p>In 18765 £200 was paid for land near the chapel for a Sunday school and this was opened 7 February 1925, free of debt much to the credit of Mr James Reed.</p>
<p>In 1889 the Redruth Circuit was created – cutting links with the Kooringa Circuit.</p>
<p>The first Redruth minister was Thomas M. Rowe, 1889-90.</p>
<p>United Methodist came in 1900.</p>
<p>The first Methodist minister was Rev. W.H. Rofe, 1900-01.</p>
<p>In 1940 the circuit became Burra-Redruth when Rev. Neil Usher was incumbent.</p>
<p>Rev. A.S. Barratt 1943-46. (Father of Mrs Olive Oates.)</p>
<p>Rev. C.L.H. Pitman 1947-50.</p>
<p>1951 Rev. C. Christopher was followed by Rev. D. Haydon, Rev. R. Jenner and Rev. M. Edwards.</p>
<p>Redruth Church closed as a centre for regular worship in 1970, since when all services have been at the Kooringa (Burra) Church.</p>
<p>The Redruth Trust Committee then decided that the property would become a conference and camping centre and additions and changes were made. The church building was made available as a worship centre for campers.</p>
<p>[1. Tregony Street.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>This makes no sense. The two buildings were on different sites. All the evidence suggests that the second chapel was on the site of the first. The cost cited alone suggests the original walls were reused. The Tregony street property was sold only in 1876 and circumstantial evidence suggests it was used as a private school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was done in 1879.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is at best misleading. In 1879 the Sunday school was transferred to the Lutheran Church and the Wesleyans continued to use this until Methodist Union. The Methodist Church continued to use it until the Jubilee Hall became available in 1902 – a total of c. 23 years. The Primitive Methodist Chapel became available in theory from 1900, but it was in a poor state of repair and before it could be used the rear wall was demolished and rebuilt ten feet further back. The enlarged building became available for use only in 1902.</p>

<p>New Life for Scroop Park, Burra North1</p>
<p>Over the years the tennis courts at Burra North and their associated amenities block have fallen into disuse. Council is currently removing the amenities block and taking up the court surface,2 before asking the community for ideas on future use.</p>
<p>[1 The name Scroop Park was an informal one. At least from the establishment of the playground there in 1923 this area was known as Lowe Park. It was named after Mr Charles Lowe 1854-1925. Until 1921 he lived at Redruth where he had a bakery near to the park. He was also a member of the Town Council, representing North Ward from December 1907 to November 1913. The name Scroop Park certainly derived from much later. In March 1972 the Aberdeen Tennis Club erected gate pillars at the entrance to the Aberdeen Tennis Courts in appreciation of Mr &amp; Mrs Scroop’s 30 years of service (1940-70) as joint secretary-treasurers of the club and for the many hours spent working in this sports area. (Syd. Scroop 1904-83 and Florrie Scroop nee Hirschausen 1905-91) Thirty odd years later the bronze plaques were stolen, but the pillars were left there when they were enclosed in the Off Leash Dog Park in late 2014.</p>
<p>2The surfaces of five courts were still there in 2016.]</p>

<p>Article celebrating Burra Community Print’s 10th Birthday</p>
<p>[Actually this date celebrated the 10th anniversary of Terry Wilson’s arrival as owner/editor and the transformation of the publication from a largely advertising medium to a more conventional newspaper. The Burra Broadcaster began in 1991 and the information in the 100th issue indicates that Burra Community Print predated the Burra Broadcaster:</p>
<p>Issue 100, 24 February 1993 page 1: The Burra Broadcaster</p>
<p>This issue is the 100th since changing to the present format. All in all the advertising medium put out by the Burra Community Print has seen 415 editions and editorial comment has been running for 112 editions. The Broadcaster began when BCP moved to new premises in December 1990.</p>
<p>In fact the origin of Burra Community Print as a business appears to be in August 1984, with an announcement in Burra School &amp; Community News of 16 August 1984</p>
<p>[An insert] Burra Community Print 7 Bridge Terrace, Burra.</p>
<p>From the beginning of August we announce a new printing service for Burra and the Surrounding Areas.</p>
<p>Design – Artwork – Print – Collate – Bind</p>
<p>Trevor Walshaw.</p>
<p>The reference to editions before January 1991 is unclear, but presumably refers to material distributed by insertion in Burra School &amp; Community News. I have noted advertising inserts in that publication from 1985 onwards. These insertions were certainly printed by Burra Community Print and frequently carried large advertisements for that business.]</p>
<p>When Terry Wilson took over in 1993 there was one casual employee, Cory Heneker who then became an apprentice. Within a few months the business needed another employee and Julie Pawelski was taken on as a Graphic Arts apprentice. The business was then located where Mongolata Gold now operates, but this proved too small and a move was made to the Jennison Building, which had previously housed Burra Video and Photographics. Equipment was updated, allowing full colour works and the whole gamut of commercial printing. The opportunity to offer the Eudunda community a newspaper content they had not enjoyed for more than twenty years was a challenge that was eagerly embraced. An office was opened in Pt Pirie and one briefly in Pt Augusta. Danny Smith completed his apprenticeship with Burra Community Print early in 2003. Helen Stockman has been the editor for much of this year. Burra Community Print produced Maureen &amp; Barry Wright’s 7th edition of their book River Murray Chart; a project involving more than three tonnes of paper and board. [5 photos.]</p>

<p>Burra Parks</p>
<p>A new Friends of Parks group is being formed to help conserve the national parks reserves in the Burra area, such as Caroona Creek, Redbanks, Mokota and Pandappa. The parks are quite diverse in nature.</p>
<p>Pandappa lies east of Terowie and grades from rocky hill country to chenopod scrubland and mallee. It covers 1,100 ha and is noted for its birdlife.</p>
<p>Caroona grades from spectacular rocky ridges with great views of the eastern rangelands to mallee vegetation and scrubland intersected by creek lines with fresh water springs and plenty of bird and animal life.</p>
<p>Mokota is 500 ha of grassland with more than 200 species of native plants, some of them rare and threatened. Wild flowers are abundant in late winter and spring.</p>
<p>Redbanks contains Baldina Creek with mallee and wildlife. Fossils of note have been found in the area. There is a designated camping area.</p>
<p>Friends of Parks could become involved in conservation of historic and fossil sites, revegetation, pest management, wildlife management, wildlife surveys, writing and information work, administration, photography and fundraising. A meeting is scheduled for 5 August. There are 117 such groups in SA.</p>

<p>Burra Cycling Classic is to be held this weekend, 2 &amp; 3 August. The classic event this year is to be dedicated to the memory of the late Vic. Dodman. Vic was a dedicated cyclist who competed for more than 60 years. He was a keen amateur as a teenager and a professional in his 20s. After a bad fall he had to retire in 1949. At the age of 51 he made a comeback when doctors recommended ‘a little exercise’. He trained some 300 to 400 miles a week and in 1968 won the Adelaide to Burra Race. He then went to Victoria for the Lakes Entrance Race of 197 miles, coming 7th. He came 5th in the Melbourne-Warrnambool race of 161 miles. He travelled to Europe and competed in a number of veterans’ events. He continued to compete in Australia till illness forced his retirement, when he moved to Burra with his wife, Gill. The 2002 event was won by Brian Toseland, a cousin of the famous Deane Toseland, who took fastest time honours in 1938. This year’s event will feature a race to Eudunda and back over 140 km. There will be junior races in the afternoon and on Sunday an 8.5 km town course. [Photo of Vic. Dodman in 1978.]</p>

<p>Wind Prospect Pty Ltd is proposing to develop a wind farm in the Mt Bryan-Hallett area. The proposal is for up to 150 wind energy turbines to produce up to 300 MW. They would be 3-bladed multi-pitched horizontal axis machines at a height of 110 m (tower plus blade in vertical position.). They would be located in five clusters on the mounts and ranges. The feasibility study will include a qualified heritage consultant to cover indigenous and non-indigenous heritage values.</p>
<p>Burra Pool. There is serious doubt that the Burra Pool will open this year. The existing pool coating has failed and tenders have been called for tiling the pool. There is also an issue with the Department of Education, Training and Employment in finalising the Joint-Use Agreement with the Council. This should have been resolved soon after the construction of the pool in 1993. Council has resolved not to accept any tender until Council has ownership of the pool and the Joint-Use Agreement has been agreed upon. The swimming season normally starts on 4 November.</p>

<p>Premier Mike Rann visited Burra en route to Adelaide from Pt Pirie last Wednesday. He undertook to get a resolution to the Burra Swimming Pool impasse. It appears that defining the boundary of the land to transfer to Council had been one sticking point, but when this had been agreed as the land within the pool’s perimeter fence, the Department’s manager then could not accept the terms of use agreed to by the school and council in 1997. [Details are printed.]</p>
<p>Mr Rann also had a look at the Burra Hospital. The Government recently announced an extra $20 million over the next four years for country hospitals.</p>

An agreement with SA Water is also needed as only one sewer service feeds both the school and the swimming pool.

The ‘Burra Remembers’ project received $3,658 from a ‘Saluting Their Service’ funding round to allow the work to be done. The local RSL contributed $1,000.</p>
<p>Goyder Council &amp; the Galah Problem</p>
<p>Council has set out first to gauge the level of public concern before taking any action to reduce galah numbers.</p>
<p>Ian Falkenberg, district Ranger for the Department of Environment and Heritage suggests a working party to examine the issue of large numbers in Burra. Council will then discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>Burra’s Christmas Celebrations will all return to Christmas Eve this year; the pageant, arrival of Father Christmas, the Christmas cake decorating contest and auction and Carols by Candlelight will all combine in one big community event.</p>

<p>Burra Ward Project Funds were allocated at Council’s October meeting. Four projects applied for funding:</p>
<p>The Burra Community Development Program $7,500 as matching funding for the refurbishment of the stage, auditorium and foyer flooring at the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Burra Senior Citizens for an automatic watering system for Burra Creek Gardens. This was referred back for further costing and reconsideration by Burra Ward Councillors.</p>
<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery $5,000 for a part-time administrator/curator. This was not supported as being outside the fund criteria.</p>
<p>Burra Community Sports Club $8,300 to $9,000 for a retaining wall. This was not supported because Council had already made provision for this work in its annual budget.</p>

There is also a big array of visiting on site services including physiotherapy, speech pathology, mental health, outreach nursing, dietetics, social work, etc.</p>

<p>Barkers of Baldina Homes Inc. held its AGM last week. Chairman Jock Duncan presented his report:</p>
<p>Units 9 &amp; 11 had bathroom upgrades, leaving only two others to be done.</p>
<p>All Chapel Street homes now have ducted air conditioning.</p>
<p>Lighting has been improved in Commercial Street units.</p>
<p>During the year two tenants died; Mr Ernst Osterhage and Mr Geoff Pearce. Also Mrs Audrey Little and Mrs Secomb moved into higher level care.</p>
<p>New residents were Mrs Pat Hanlin in Unit 1 Commercial Street and Mr John Stockman in Unit 3 Chapel Street.</p>
<p>Two units are currently available in Pearse Row, Commercial Street.</p>
<p>Jock Duncan was re-elected as Chairman, with Ron Thamm as Vice Chairman and John Arthur as Secretary.</p>
<p>The Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes in Commercial Street were first built in 1970, since when 75 people have lived there. Mr Barker left a bequest for high quality retirement accommodation for the aged in Burra. Firstly nine units were built in Commercial Street, followed by a further five in Chapel Street* and more recently by four more in John Barker Street.</p>
<p>[*This seems to imply that the Chapel Street units were built after 1970. They have all the appearances of older stone buildings and it seems more likely that they were adapted for this new purpose, rather than actually built. Further research would be needed to verify their history.]</p>
<p>All units are fully equipped, air conditioned, have carpets and are maintained regularly. Lawns are cared for and small gardens are available for tenants. There is a mixture of one and two bedroom units. Previous Chairmen of the Board have been the late Ron Pearse and Mr Ray Jennison.</p>
<p>Issue 626, 26 November 2003, page 1</p>
<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery is in crisis. While it has a good number of enthusiastic volunteers to run the gallery on a day to day basis, it needs an injection on manpower on the Board to continue the excellent management of the past. It needs people to organise/curate exhibitions, to oversee a social program for the Friends of the Gallery, to send out newsletters, to manage the volunteer roster and to organise the ‘hanging’ committee etc. Key people have been lost, leading to the current crisis. If positions cannot be filled soon, its activities will have to be curtailed or it could even have to close its doors altogether.</p>
<p>Friends of Burra Parks. Approximately 15 people attended an orientation day at the new Hopkins Creek Conservation Park on Saturday 22 November. It is located near the Burra Creek Gorge and has a range of treasures from waterholes to breath-taking vistas. District Ranger Ian Falkenberg gave a talk on the history and ecology of the park. Harvey Neal and John Smyth shared results of a recent biosurvey.</p>

<p>Minister for Tourism, Jane Lomax-Smith has responded to a letter from Tony Thorogood re Terowie and in it indicates her concerns about its future.</p>
<p>Preserving its key visitor attractions is beyond the resources of a small community. It needs the co-operation of all key stakeholders: The SA Tourism Commission</p>
<p>Regional Council of Goyder</p>
<p>Department of Environment &amp; Heritage</p>
<p>The Community of Peterborough</p>
<p>She identified three issues:</p>
<p>The need to identify, stabilise and conserve/maintain key surviving heritage assets.</p>
<p>The need to develop good visual interpretation at several significant sites.</p>
<p>The need of the host community to exercise some degree of care and management over any improvements undertaken.</p>
<p>The minister has asked SATAC to convene meetings to canvass these issues and see how these challenges could be met.</p>

<p>Saltbush Clothing has closed its doors in Burra and relocated to Adelaide.</p>
<p>The business began in October 1988 when Elspeth Radford opened her first shop (next to Beaut Fruit) called Saltbush for Kids. It was an immediate hit, with stylish country-style, well-made clothing. Later she moved into adult clothing and the business grew. Over the years Saltbush Clothing has won a string of business awards. The departure of Saltbush and Glasgow House now leaves Burra without a clothing store.</p>
<p>The Burra Railway Station. There was quite a lot of interest in the railway station, with about 20 people attending the meeting at the Burra Hotel on Monday evening. As a first step a request will be made to see whether Transport SA could hand it over to the group. A full report of the meeting will be made available to anyone interested from Simon &amp; Bruna at the Newsagency from next Friday.</p>

<p>On 11 December about sixty people including children worked from 5 a.m. on filming take after take in morning light at the Midnight Oil House. They then moved to the Burra Railway Station for more filming, before taking a break of several hours. At 5 p.m. they were back at the Midnight Oil House with its oat crop for sunset filming. Quite a few locals watched the session.</p>
<p>The Midnight Oil House has featured on many postcards, calendars, posters etc., but this is the first time it has been used for a television commercial to be screened around the world. The crew flew in from New York only thirty-six hours earlier. Their camera was valued at $300,000 and was mounted on a crane, which was in turn mounted on a truck. They came with a wind machine, a catering van, a truckload of gear and other equipment. Burra CFS attended the shoot.</p>
<p>The Midnight Oil House got to be called that because it featured on the first album produced by the band Midnight Oil, called Diesel and Dust.</p>

<p>Autumn, winter and spring are busy, with summer a quiet period.</p>
<p>The Burra Passport has always been the most popular product.</p>
<p>The centre saw 8,000 visitors in 2002 and 10,000 in 2003.*</p>
<p>This was thought to represent 20% of visitors to the town.</p>
<p>[* Note that this does not accord with the report in the issue of 19 November 2003, page 2 that said the Burra Visitor Centre had been busy with more than 10,000 visitors between July and October with Passport sales to just under 5,000 of them. The December version seems more believable.]</p>

<p>Obituary. Charles Dewhirst – 1 June 1969 to 20 December 2003.</p>
<p>Charles was the third child of Gillian &amp; Alan Dewhirst and was born at Clare. He had two sisters, Virginia and Andrea. He was an adventurous and independent young boy, walking at twelve months and swimming the channel at Fisherman’s Bay and diving from the Pt Broughton Jetty at five years of age. He began school at Booborowie and played football and cricket, but his real love was trucks. At age 11 he was driving all manner of farm machinery and soon moved onto motorbikes and cars. He went to BCS, but left at 151⁄2 to drive trucks. After working locally for a few years, he went to Kalgoorlie, working for Roche Bros. Two daughters, Ashlii-Maree and Laimii-Lee, were born to him and Jenny. Returning to SA in 1944, Charlie was driving trucks for as many hours as the law allowed. In 1999 he started work at Booth Transport in Tanunda and in 2000 moved to Freeling. A highlight was carting water at the eclipse at Lyndhurst. Leisure time was spent at the Murray River, teaching his daughters to swim and skiing on his knee-board. Charlie’s ashes are to be interred at Burra Cemetery.</p>

<p>BCS. The Year 12 SACE results for 2003 Stage 1 were of a similar standard to those of 2001 and 2002, but the Stage 2 results from a small cohort were disappointing. Only 53.3% of senior students completed a full SACE Certificate. This reflects the views of staff that numerous senior students exhibited a lack of both attendance and effort. The principal said he looked forward to better results this year.</p>

<p>The Department for Environment &amp; Heritage has acquired the Tooralie Gorge property of 2,900 ha, adjoining the Caroona Creek Conservation Park. The park contains exceptionally high biodiversity values and has long been ungrazed by livestock. Short term management issues include road reserve closures and feral animal control. Hopkins Creek Conservation Park in the Burra Hills also contains exceptionally high biodiversity values and it is for these that it is being maintained rather than for visitor access. Redbanks Conservation Park will be promoted by the SA Museum as a site where the public can see and visit mega fauna fossils. A resource centre is required in Burra to display replicas and examples of mega fauna. Successful burning and grazing trials were held at Mokota Conservation Park in autumn 2003 and more are planned for 2004. Burns have proved particularly useful in removing horehound seed, with 80% gone in one year and most in subsequent years. Aerial feral goat shooting is planned for Caroona Creek and Redbanks Parks in March. Co-ordinated fox baiting is also planned for 2004. Funding has been allocated for boxthorn, peppertree and artichoke control along Baldina Creek. A section of the Hallelujah Hills has been acquired by World’s End Conservation Pty Ltd, a private group of conservationists. It is a 415 ha property of high biodiversity. There is concern over vandalism of Aboriginal rock art along Stone Chimney Creek.</p>

<p>Letter. Kerry Fitzpatrick writes a letter recounting her experiences in Mt Bryan after buying the school there in 2003. They expected to be moving into a safe and friendly place, but found they had one contractor who never came back and one who did, but ripped them off. They awaiting welcoming neighbours in vain and the kids were bullied at school. Small things were stolen from around their home, including her daughter’s pet rabbit and someone armed with a gun at night terrorised their animals, eventually shooting their pet duck in the back. Décor Made Easy offered genuine help and support and some of the community gave support and comfort so that things have now somewhat improved.</p>

<p>Letter. Dr Roger Cross writes a long letter on galahs, in which he notes how the favourable comments on them in the nineteenth century changed, as in the twentieth century the word became slang for an idiot or had other connotations of derision or contempt. The assertions about the bird in the recent Council newsletter that the galah ‘is causing the death of many trees’, is quite without evidence.</p>
<p>Has anyone actually done a count to verify that ‘many are dying’?</p>
<p>Has the cause of any deaths of trees been verified? For instance could it be borers or flocks of starlings or could it be dieback?</p>
<p>Galahs are noisy and colourful and large and numerous – so it is easy to blame them.</p>
<p>He concludes by asking for a proper environmental impact study before taking any action and wonders whether people’s complaints are truly because of dead trees, or actually sparked by the noise the birds make coming to roost or on getting up.</p>
<p>Letter. Stephen Kerrigan, Goyder Council CEO writes a long letter focused on vandalism.</p>
<p>Vandalism has increased over the past two years.</p>
<p>It takes workers away from the other jobs they could/should be doing.</p>
<p>It costs the community on average $400 per week or:-</p>
<p>$20,800 p.a. for damage to toilets</p>
<p>$19,988 p.a. for damage to street signs</p>
<p>$2,964 p.a. to re-erect white guide posts</p>
<p>$13,439 p.a. to replace white guide posts</p>
<p>$1,820 to repair pine railings in Burra</p>
<p>Overall the cost is c. $56,000 p.a.</p>
<p>The damage is largely (though not exclusively) the work of a small group of young people for whose behaviour parents must shoulder some of the responsibility.</p>
<p>He goes on to list the possible penalties, but stresses that in order for these to have an impact on the problem, the offenders have to be caught and the community needs to be united in reporting offences/offenders if there is to be any impact on the problem.</p>

Power and lights were installed in 1954 and a Sunday school room was added at the back in 1956. An old Housing Trust room was added in 1963 and this in turn was replaced in 1963 with an Atco style building. The property will be sold.</p>

<p>Letter. Stuart &amp; Ruth Norris submit a lengthy letter on galahs. They call for research to substantiate any claims and say galahs do not kill trees, and they rather lay the blame for such death on land clearing, irrigation practices and the effect of both these on the water table. They deny that the noise problem is real. Visitors love the flocks of galahs that are far less offensive to their ears than the dangerous drivers that use the roads as race tracks.</p>
<p>Letter. Glenys Christopher &amp; Bob Skinner write again on the galah ‘problem’. Their point is that grain farmers inevitably create a windfall source of food for galahs, who then like to roost in trees at night. The few remaining trees in this area are in the town. If farmers planted more trees around their paddocks the birds would roost there and it would most likely have other advantages as well with respect to reducing wind erosion, providing shelter and shade.</p>

<p>Redbanks Reserve. Eighteen months ago local Danny Heading noticed some bones poking out from the wall of a creek bank at Redbanks. National Parks ranger Ian Falkenberg was informed and he passed the message on to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, which contacted representatives of the Ngadjuri Aboriginal group. Their heritage chairman Vincent Branson attended the site last week for the careful excavation and examination of the remains by archaeologists from Flinders University. Their conclusion was that the bones were those of an adult Aboriginal woman with the body of an infant under her arm. The Ngadjuri will arrange a suitable reburial.</p>

<p>St Catherine’s Anglican Church at Hallett was formally closed last Sunday. It had been unused for several years. About 50 people attended the final service. The church was opened and consecrated in 1957 by the late Bishop of Adelaide the Rt Rev. Dr T.T. Reed and dedicated to St Catherine of Sienna. [See Burra Record 11 June 1957, page 7and 17 Sep. 1957, page 1.] The unusual shape of the building won awards. Sunday’s service was conducted by the Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. Garry Weatherill, assisted by Geraldine Smedley of Burra. Mary Shattock played the organ. Having been sold, the building was deconsecrated and secularised. Jan Tiver read the Declaration of Secularisation. [2photos]</p>

<p>The Kingston Street Bridge is to be strengthened. The Council has appointed a contractor to begin work on the 1879 bridge. Concrete work will begin on 19 April and is due to be completed by 17 May. The steel work will follow. The creek is to be drained between the weir and the causeway downstream. Pumping has already begun. The bike track has been closed for the duration of the work and the Senior Citizens’ Garden will also be closed. It is expected the bridge itself will only have to be closed for one day, when the steel beams are placed beneath it. There will then be a detour via Ayers, George and Thames Streets. [Photo]</p>

<p>Mokota Conservation Park</p>
<p>A controlled burn of 30 ha was trialled to investigate how best to control/reduce pest plants and increase the health and vigour of native grasses in the 455 ha park. Dense ground cover had built up since the park was acquired in 1999, suppressing native grass regrowth and encouraging pest species. Mokota is unusual among the state’s Conservation Parks because it is purely grassland. The dominant species is iron grass (Lomandra multiflora) and it also has two nationally endangered species; the small scurf pea (Cullen parvum) and trailing hopbush (Dodonea procumbens).</p>

<p>[I would not place great reliance on this date. Topsfield’s Butcher shop was in that building and was still operating when Topsfield’s sold their business to F. &amp; J. McLean in 1972. Check on the possibility of the small shop immediately north of the butcher’s. There is an advertisement for a sale for McKenna in November 1955, which may indicate when he left.]</p>

Failing that, he sometimes returned with a bag of galahs that the children then had to pluck – a very difficult process. She has since been told that they should have skinned the birds, but that advice came too late. The birds were stewed with onions and herbs and were then regarded as a treat and were not tough.</p>

<p>Princess Royal Feedlot</p>
<p>The owner of Princess Royal Station, Simon Rowe, says there will be no increased traffic along Ayers Street in Burra as a result of the proposed feedlot on the property. Plans for the lot have been put out for public consultation by Goyder Council. Trucks will use the Old Adelaide Road entrance. Some local residents of Ayers Street have started a petition asking for a load limit on Ayers Street. Jenny Carter says that heavy commercial traffic to and from Princess Royal has been increasing for some months. The application before Council does not make clear what route the feedlot trucks would take.</p>
<p>Roger Cross, who owns two properties on Ayers Street, has lodged an objection to heavy traffic such as B-doubles using Ayers Street, saying that their vibrations would damage old cottages along the street with earth foundations and also the miners’ dugouts. There would also be dangers for children, pedestrians and cars passing trucks on the narrow road. Des Woolley, another resident of the street, says it is too narrow and too lightly built for the mass of vehicles the proposal would generate – added to which, he fears that much of the traffic would be nocturnal.</p>

(BCDP) was established in June 2000 following a special meeting of Main Street, as a new committee to manage a Working Towns Project, to prepare a report for the Goyder Council with recommendations for a management structure for the Burra Town Hall. Council handed the management of the hall to the BCDP in October 2001. At the November 2003 AGM there was insufficient interest to fill the vacant committee positions. At present the BCDP and its sub-committees are in abeyance. If the committee cannot fill its positions the BCDP will fold and the Town Hall and its Telecentre will close its doors to the community. The hard work has been done. Much renovation has been accomplished at the hall and monies have been raised. A public meeting at the Town Hall on 13 May at 6.30 p.m. will decide the future of the BCDP.</p>

<p>Return to a design where cars run right past the shops.</p>
<p>A design with a double row of parking around the curve of the shops, with the north bound lane removed and the south bound lane converted to a two-way flow.</p>
<p>Option three seemed to get more approval than the other two.</p>

<p>Master Planning Options for Market Square and Best Place</p>
<p>Since the project commenced in early April consultation has been undertaken with local residents, traders, BRTBA and visitors. Some points raised were:</p>
<p>The intersection is confusing and visitors occasionally travel in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Too many differences in types of paving – some of which are slippery when wet.</p>
<p>Unsafe drains.</p>
<p>Lighting is poor in both power and design.</p>
<p>Public space is too disjointed, with too much bitumen.</p>
<p>There is inconsistency in the width of crossovers and many lack handrails.</p>
<p>Poor signage, and inconsistent in style.</p>
<p>The Post Office is an eyesore and doesn’t fit in the heritage core of the town.</p>
<p>Trucks backing into Landmark are disruptive/dangerous.</p>
<p>There is a lack of designated parking for caravans, coaches and 4WD vehicles.</p>
<p>There is a perception that the Council Car Park area is not open to the public.</p>
<p>Traders park in front of their shops.</p>
<p>There is a need for greater pedestrian safety in Commercial St.</p>
<p>The jinker should be more prominently displayed; either near the Mine entrance or in Market Square and should be better protected and lit.</p>
<p>The present jinker site would make a good coach parking bay.</p>
<p>Alfresco dining areas could be developed in Market Square.</p>
<p>Market Square needs better landscaping and public furniture.</p>
<p>Some people wanted Market Square and best Place to remain basically unchanged.</p>
<p>In particular people wanted to retain:</p>
<p>The stone kerbing</p>
<p>Angle parking</p>
<p>The rotunda rose garden</p>
<p>Wide streets</p>
<p>Idea 1 seems to have attracted most favourable comment.</p>
<p>Idea 2 was the least favoured because of the problems generated by high speed traffic coming round the corner from Commercial Street</p>
<p>Idea 3 was favoured by those wanting little change.</p>
<p>At Best Place the main changes wanted were:</p>
<p>Better lighting</p>
<p>Better signage</p>
<p>Lower speed for through traffic (presently 60 km/hr)</p>
<p>Most favoured changes were:</p>
<p>Clearing of vegetation from around the old Redruth Bridge</p>
<p>Landscaping the area behind the Royal Exchange Hotel</p>
<p>A realignment of the bike track to loop over and around the Redruth Bridge</p>
<p>Detailed plans will now be developed.</p>

<p>Objection to planned development - Anthony Thorogood &amp; Nell Seidel separately have lengthy objections to a proposal to change farmland immediately before the first house at the southern entrance to the town to be zoned General Industry – Metal Manufacturing. They say the application would result in the entrance to the town being dominated by:</p>
<p>A large shed 27 m x 12 m x more than 6 m high</p>
<p>Two large signs 10 m x 1 m saying ‘Shamrock Fabrication Welding Guillotine Folding</p>
<p>A line-up of trailers parked along the road ready to sell</p>
<p>They also state other objections:</p>
<p>Much noise would be generated</p>
<p>There could be pollution from spray paint drift</p>
<p>Welding would interfere with radio and TV reception</p>
<p>The welding and cutting would increase the threat to the town of fires</p>
<p>It is pointed out that there is ample space for such activity in the Burra North Mine Area and along the bypass road. Ratepayers should not be misled either about supposed employment opportunities – the application states only one employee.</p>
<p>[Although the applicant is not named here, it soon became clear that it was Peter Kelly.]</p>

<p>Industrial Zone</p>
<p>The editor reprinted an article from 15 November 1995</p>
<p>It deals with the problem of light industry not being able to find a location in the town. The obstacles needed to be overcome were:</p>
<p>Zoning regulations</p>
<p>A perceived heritage conflict</p>
<p>Proximity to a watercourse</p>
<p>Council had been considering the problem for a long time, without making any apparent progress. The Burra Broadcaster had been asking questions about it for two years and getting fobbed off with a series of inadequate responses. Councils in other areas of SA had confronted like problems, but had managed to find solutions. Even twenty extra jobs would make a significant difference to the town – look at the impact when Adchem shed fifty workers. Families left, school enrolment fell and real estate values dropped.</p>
<p>The editor then turned to 2004 and said nothing proactive had been done, save the rezoning of Stockman’s paddock north of the golf course. The recent application was 246 metres from the nearest house and lay outside the declared heritage area, but the dilemma of finding a suitable block will remain until Council acquired some appropriate land and made it available with the required amenities.</p>

A Councillor has said though, it would be too costly to get three phase power, water and telephone to the site.</p>
<p>Letter. Patricia Dale of Georgetown writes wondering why the area from the Morgan Road –Young St intersection to the Burra Golf Club could not be zones for industry, as it already seems to have that characteristic – or alternatively along the bypass.

<p>Theft. A farmhouse east of Burra was broken into a couple of weeks ago and a number of firearms were stolen.</p>
<p>Goyder Council has decided to increase its overall rate revenue by 7.1% for the coming year.</p>
<p>The rise in valuation across the whole area was 20.5%.</p>
<p>A fixed charge of $175 applies to each assessment and rates in the dollar are:</p>
<p>0.6662 for Burra township</p>
<p>0.3989 for Eudunda township</p>
<p>0.3354 for other towns and rural areas</p>
<p>Jubilee Fountain. Burra’s old drinking fountain adjacent to the motel has been repaired and protected with a new fence. Some time ago the top piece was broken off. Damien Quinn did the precise welding needed to repair it and Jamie Pollard painted it and erected the fence. A small plate on it indicates it was part of a Children’s Centenary Jubilee. It is thought to be Victorian in design. [Photo]</p>
<p>[Note. To Commemorate Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee in 1887 there was a major exhibition in Adelaide. A public subscription was raised in Burra for a special train to take 455 children and 175 adults from Burra to the exhibition, which was held in grounds that are now part of the University of Adelaide. The train was reported to be the first passenger train to pass through the new tunnel under King William Street on the new spur line to the exhibition grounds. After the event the committee found they had an excess of £31-12-0 from the subscriptions and it was decided that half of that should be spent on a drinking fountain to be placed in Jubilee Avenue – a double row of trees that had just then been planted along the eastern side of the road between Kooringa and Aberdeen as an unemployment relief project. See Burra Record, 18 Oct. 1887, page 2; 25 Oct. 1887, page 2; 8 Nov. 1887, page 3; 14 February 1888, page 2; 20 April 1888, page 2; 11 September 1888, page 2; 18 September 1888, page 2 and 22 Mar. 1889, page 2.]</p>

<p>It is a positive development for the town</p>
<p>It offers the future prospect of employment in Burra</p>
<p>It is a new and exciting development, not an eyesore.</p>
<p>Letter. Leo Sturman writes to say that Burra needs new industry and needs more than tourism to survive or it will slowly decline. Council needs to acknowledge it has to spend money to make money and must create a serviced industrial area. Taking into account heritage values, this will need to be away from the town’s core tourist attractions. The tragedy of the present debate is that the proposed new industry is the right move, but in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Letter. Anonymous writes complaining of the apathy that prevails re the periodic reviews of Goyder Council’s composition and structure. Two written submissions and one late submission was a very poor response from 4,000 ratepayers. By a small majority Council decided not to change anything. Goyder has one Councillor per 311 ratepayers. The average across local government is one per 551. Your response is encouraged by way of a submission by 29 July.</p>

<p>Andrew Gebhardt’s Carob Orchard is now 20 years old. He imported twelve varieties of carob from California to establish the southern hemisphere’s first carob plantation and now the ‘Macarob’ enterprise is flourishing. The carob produces a bean pod and the fleshy exterior of the seeds contains 50% complex sugars and exhibits an unusual malty flavour. The Gebhardts set out to raise a high quality crop and concentrated on producing carob syrups. Today there are some 7,000 trees planted over 125 acres. The syrup is sold in Australia and exported to Korea. The seeds are due to be exported to England, where they are used to make a food thickener known as Emulsifier 410. The carobs are good for the environment, with no chemical requirements and only modest water needs. Carob can be used as a chocolate substitute and it lacks the theobromines and caffeine that make chocolate a headache for some people.</p>

<p>The Burra Mine Site Trail will be launched at the Friends of the Park Forum in October. A full colour brochure has been created showing the extent of the grasslands in the Mid North. The trail, which is virtually in the centre of the town of Burra, takes people through the grassland where native grasses and small bushes will be name plated. The walk is at its best in late spring and early summer, when the plants are likely to be flowering. More than 120 species of native plants, of which 37 are listed as rare or endangered species, are protected here. The tour and launch will be held on 23 October.</p>

<p>Goyder Council and A. &amp; K. McBride have settled in court a disagreement over a contract of sale involving O’Connor’s shed, with the original deal being kept.</p>
<p>Council minutes from February 2002 record a contract of sale between the Council and A.P. &amp; K.L. McBride. This was reported at the time as involving the transfer to the Council of five vacant allotments on Taylor St and one on Cooper St and four blocks at the south end of the town, earmarked for cemetery extensions. The shed and its surrounds were to be transferred to McBrides.</p>
<p>Council CEO said the Ombudsman was called in at the request of local resident Doug Wiltshire, to look at the sale process. The Ombudsman recommended Council advertise and seek comment on the disposal of community land. Council’s interpretation of the relevant law was that this sale of land that had been advertised did not need to be further advertised. After the Ombudsman’s advice the Council was faced with proceedings from McBride’s seeking that Council abide by the sale contract. Council settled the matter in the Supreme Court last year, with both sides agreeing to pursue the land transfers as in the original agreement. The contracts and agreements were finalised in March this year, subject to the blocks next to the cemetery being subdivided. The land transfers went through the Lands Titles Office last week.</p>
<p>O’Connor’s Shed (now McBride’s Shed) was bought in 1989 by the Burra Burra DC in a deal including the tourism bus. The Council at the time saw the usefulness of continuing to use the site for unhitching road trains and allowed truck operators to use the site free of charge. Attempts to sell the shed and surrounds in the early 1990s ran into problems due to saleyard access issues and also due to the risk from flooding. A more recent contract with the Ngadjuri Aboriginal Group also fell through when funding was found to be unavailable.</p>
<p>Goyder Council &amp; Doug Wiltshire</p>
<p>Doug Wiltshire threatened legal action against Goyder Councillors in November 2002. He accused them of negligence, misrepresentation, misleading and deceiving ratepayers and failing to act honestly. In 2003 he also invoiced the Council for $5,995 for his professional time investigating the O’Connor’s Shed matter, including publishing details in the print media. Council believes the issue to be without foundation and after legal opinion has invited Mr Wiltshire to proceed with his legal action. Council CEO Steve Kerrigan says no legal action has been taken so far.</p>

<p>Obituary. Gwen Bartlett died at Victor Harbor in June aged 101. She was the wife of the late Rev. Harry Bartlett, a Methodist missionary and minister. They came to Burra after being evacuated from Papua in 1941. She spent the last 33 years in Victor Harbor.</p>
<p>[Rev. Bartlett was welcomed to the Burra-Redruth Circuit in April 1942 and stayed for about a year. In September 1943 he is reported to have returned to missionary duties in the South Pacific, but was forced by ill health to return to Australia in mid-1944. The paper said his had family stayed in Burra during his missionary work. Gwen Bartlett was born Crystal Gwendoline Lillian Johnson 8 April 1903 at Crystal Brook and married Henry Kitchener Bartlett in 1929. Her husband had died in 1965 at Keith aged 61.]</p>

<p>S.T. Gill. On 27 October 1880 S.T. Gill collapsed and died on the steps of the Melbourne GPO. He was dressed in ragged clothes of the poor and had no identification on him. It was twenty-four hours before the police could put a name to the body. He had been a renowned painter who had once had fame and fortune, but he had been undone by drink and ensuing poverty. Today he is remembered particularly for his paintings of struggling diggers around Ballarat and for other portraits. A small S.T. Gill watercolour can currently fetch c. $50,000. He also painted men toiling for copper and a handsome collection of these works can be seen at the Burra Regional Art Gallery.</p>

<p>Goyder Council’s Development assessment Panel last week approved Peter Kelly’s application for a shed for sheet metal manufacturing. However, the application was also referred to Heritage SA, which recommends that approval not be given. If the DAP does not totally adopt Heritage SA’s recommendation the decision has to go to the Development Assessment Commission in Adelaide before it can be enacted. This was done on 30 August. The application was also referred to the Environment Protection Authority for comment, as it involved a spray-painting booth. Transport SA was also consulted because the development will require a new access to a primary arterial road – the Barrier Highway. The EPA recommended approval subject to conditions. Transport SA also approved. The application also had to be advertised for public comment. Of the 22 representations made, 18 were against and 4 were for the application, although some of those applied would support it in another location.</p>
<p>Minister for Tourism Jane Lomax-Smith expressed her concerns that it had the potential to detract from the visitors’ ‘arrival’ experience. Goyder Council’s Planner said that despite the application being able to satisfy the demands of the EPA and Transport SA, he was of the opinion that this will be overshadowed by possible negative implications. Metal manufacturing should be in an industrial zone. He supported the concerns of Heritage SA and on balance believed that the development was seriously at variance with the Goyder development Plan. He recommended that the application be refused. The DAP’s decision to approve means that the final word now lies with the Development Assessment Commission in Adelaide.</p>

<p>Letter. [Because Leo Sturman’s letter provoked such a response, it is printed below in full.]</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>As a member of the organizing committee for the Wheal Burra Burra Festival, taking place in November, it is sad to have to admit that despite our approaches to the local churches for their support, by becoming involved in some way in the festival, not one answered our letter, or contacted us in any way, with any positive response.</p>
<p>We can only assume that the church organizations are so far removed from the community, that they feel they have no part in it anymore, or that they have become so close to their god (s) as to not need to bother.</p>
<p>We are saddened by this total lack of interest, and can only reflect that with churches closing down, and being sold off all over the state, and indeed, the country, that Christianity is indeed dying, and that it will not be long before a more active religious force takes over. The future of Christianity begins here, in our local churches, and in every community that calls itself Christian, and that to be active within that community, is the only way to full resurrection.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Leo Sturman.</p>
<p>P.S. Information has been received by the Broadcaster that the Uniting Church does plan to have its church open from 10 a.m. until 4.00 p.m. on 13th November. Ed.</p>

<p>Letter. Danny Smith replied to a statement the previous week by Leo Sturman when Leo expressed disappointment that none of Burra’s Churches had responded to enquiries about their participation in the Wheal Burra Burra Festival and made a suggestion that they were a dying force. Danny pointed out that members of Christian churches in Burra were already widely involved in the festival as members of the community and in a wide range of organisations.</p>
<p>Letter. Olive Oates also wrote suggesting that Mr Sturman could easily have clarified the positions of the churches with a few phone calls before making his unwarranted assertions. ‘For Mr Sturman – a relative newcomer to Burra to make such unresearched, sweeping and ill-informed judgements is both offensive and unfair.’</p>
<p>Letter. Rev. Frank Tuppin also responded to say that Mr Sturman was wrong in his assumptions and that most church members were heavily involved in other community groups.</p>
<p>But ‘&hellip;since we were not invited to share in the formation of this vision, we should be given the grace to respond as any other organization would as to the extent or willingness of our involvement. I apologize on behalf of the Uniting Church for not responding sooner to the Wheal Committee’s request for support.’</p>
<p>Letter. S. Thamm wrote to say that Mr Sturman must be far removed from the town to write such an ill-informed letter and reminding him that there is ‘a vast network of people within our churches whose voluntary work is invaluable and untiring for the benefit of Burra and beyond.’</p>
<p>Letter. Mary Woollacott writes a longer letter in response to Leo Sturman on behalf of the wardens and congregation of St Mary’s Church. She echoed much of what has already been noted, but also pointed out that St Joseph’s Catholic Church and St Mary’s Anglican Church were both open every day to locals and tourists alike. The Uniting Church would be open on Saturday 13 November.</p>
<p>‘But such places do not necessarily have to be turned into a formal part of the festival as they exist for a totally different purpose than the “bread and circuses” that go with even the most admirable of festivals and local celebrations.’</p>
<p>Like other letters on this subject the writer then drew attention to the ways members of all church congregations support local community organisations.</p>
<p>Susan Parker wrote a letter condemning Leo Sturman along lines similar to the other correspondents. She condemned the way in which he made ‘a range of emotive, damning and derogatory observations and predictions about Christianity in general and the local Burra churches in particular’.</p>
<p>She concluded by wondering whether ‘the Festival may not be something which the Churches would consider to fall within their ongoing “core business”.’</p>
<p>Letter. Lisa Murphy wrote also pointing out that members of church congregations were already heavily involved in the many community events of the weekend and she stated that each of the churches would be open on Sunday.</p>
<p>Letter. Maryann Angel wrote raising the same key point, but also pointing out that when churches make ‘their frequent approaches to the community for their support and presence, often no one answers their call, or contacts them in any way for a positive response.’</p>

<p>Marj Edmonds, as ‘Cousin Marjorie’ performed her last duties in Malowen Lowarth Cottage in Paxton Square last Sunday 31 October. Over the years her portrayal of a Cornish woman on the 1870s has earned much acclaim. When the cottages were restored as part of the State’s J150 celebrations, one of them was given to the National Trust to be furnished c. 1870. A group led by Colin Fidock did a great job at creating a cottage museum complete with dirt or red brick floors. The cottage opened on 12 October 1985. On 5 July 1987 Marj took over in her role as Cousin Marjorie and her performance often included cooking over the open fire in the kitchen. The back garden was planted out as a c. 1870 cottage garden with herbs, flowers and vegetables, to make Malowen Lowarth (Cornish for Hollyhock Cottage) a unique tourist attraction. Last week Marj gave her final appearance after 17 years. Tressna Martin and Dilys Bull will now present the cottage to visitors. Prior to taking over the cottage Marj looked after Redruth Gaol and the Courthouse in a 25 year period of service to the National Trust. [Photo]</p>

<p>The Minister of Trade &amp; Economic Development Karlene Maywald, publicly criticised the Board when two reports landed on her desk. One highlighted some minor clerical errors. The other was the Howe’s Report, which was a governance audit, instigated by the Board to fine tune its operation. A large turnover of staff in the past twelve months resulted in some inconsistencies in its reporting to the Department. Board Members found that a lot of extra time was being spent on reporting and addressing the extra workload, eventually making their function unworkable. As a result all but one member resigned this week. Clare &amp; Gilbert Valley Council, the Regional Council of Goyder, Northern Areas Council and the Office of Regional Affairs has agreed that a new Board needs to be quickly appointed.</p>
<p>Burra Police took part in a drug bust in Burra last week, when ten mature cannabis plants were found, along with hydroponic equipment. One male was arrested and another reported for possession and cultivation of cannabis.</p>
<p>Goyder Council. After three periods of public consultation, it has been decided to cut the number of Councillors from 13 to 7 after the next local government elections in 2006. There were 29 elected members in 1997 and this was reduced to 13 after the first term of the amalgamated Council. It was decided to keep the current ward structure with four wards.</p>

They were then told they would be billeted with local families for the duration of the show. On Monday there was cattle droving and bull dogging and yesterday saw a tractor race at BCS. Last night the first of the girls was voted off by locals assembled at Morphett’s Enginehouse. A girl will be voted off every second day until only ‘Miss Popularity’ remains. [5 coloured photos]</p>

<p>Letter. Given the enormous reaction to Roger Cross’s letter, it is printed in full:</p>
<p>‘MISS POPULARITY’ REALITY TV</p>
<p>It was with some surprise that I read the notice in my junk mail last Friday about the well-kept secret of ‘Miss Popularity’. Reality TV comes to Burra and we are induced, or at least encouraged, to become extras in this New Zealand version of a certain type of TV entertainment.</p>
<p>This event, and the evident enthusiasm of the residents of this ‘Australian Country Town’ to become involved, has astonished me. I can only imagine that as a ‘grumpy old man’ I am the only resident to be rather nauseated by the thought of our town being turned into a ‘theme park.’ Now, I have repeatedly told myself that this is harmless fun that will provide Touchdown TV viewers with a few innocent laughs at the girls’ and our expense. No great harm in that. We are told that ‘we need your (our) help to make this TV show a success - we are therefore, of critical importance; the NZ TV ratings depend on us being willing and enthusiastic participants. Perhaps our performance might help the TV company recoup some of its outlay and make it such a success that the show is marketed outside NZ, thus bringing in valuable revenue!</p>
<p>Sadly, Madam, in the hope that a reader or two may agree with me, I feel compelled to voice my conviction that this is not necessarily a good thing. (On the other hand, readers may write to you and explain how wrong I am.)</p>
<p>As I have indicated above, ‘Miss Popularity’ appears to be in the genre of reality TV. If so, this form of entertainment has been described as representing a high point (or should I say low point) in the ‘Culture of Narcissism’. This rather strange label describes a society totally wrapped up in individualism - a dysfunctional and warped society that is preoccupied with self. This kind of extreme individualism has been associated with the decay of public values. Such individualism is rooted in the belief that the desires of the individual are greater than the needs of society as a whole. It indicates a kind of society that is destined to fail.</p>
<p>Then there is the particular ideal of ‘Popularity’ itself. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines this as ‘the action or practice of courting popular favour’, and ‘the fact of being admired- approved or beloved by the people’. Being popular naturally means not offending people - in itself not such a bad trait -and, at a mundane level, I feel for the nine girls who will be voted failures in the popularity stakes. Has society come to this, I ask myself? After all, in the world of great ideas, music, literature, art, science, and all other forms of human endeavour, true achievement has not depended on being popular - often quite the reverse.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, I’m just an old wowser. Perhaps we should all simply enjoy this new experience, and be a part of the pantomime without thinking too much about what it means for our society.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Roger Cross, Burra.</p>

<p>Hallett Wind Farms</p>
<p>The Development Assessment Panel considered the proposal for the five Hallett Wind Farm Clusters put forward by Wind Prospect Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>The Brown Hill Range Cluster comprising 45 wind turbine generators and 5 wind monitoring masts and ancillary work was granted Provisional Development Plan Consent by the joint committee set up by Regional Council of Goyder and the Northern Areas Council, as it spans the border of the two councils.</p>
<p>The Bluff Range Cluster of 25 turbine generators and 2 wind monitoring masts etc. and the Willogoleche Hill Cluster comprising 26 turbine generators and 3 wind monitoring masts etc. were both granted provisional Development Plan Consent by the Goyder DAP, as was the Hallett Hill cluster of 30 generators and 4 wind monitoring masts. A decision on the Mt Bryan cluster of 30 generators and 4 wind monitoring masts was deferred. It has been disclosed that $15,000 per cluster will go into a community Trust Fund on an annual basis and it is believed landowners will receive about $3,750 annually per turbine on their property.</p>

<p>Letter from Bob Skinner &amp; Glenys Christopher agreeing with a number of the points raised by Roger Cross. They ‘do not think you are a wowser Mr Cross, but a caring, thinking individual who wonders about the apparent values of most of the people of Burra.’</p>
<p>The concern themselves with the self-esteem of the girls who are voted off and wonder if viewers get some enjoyment from seeing girls being rated as ‘failures’.</p>
<p>‘&hellip;I still think this type of T.V. is a pretty low form of entertainment when someone in the audience can shout out ‘Show us your tits’.</p>
<p>Letter. Roger Cross again writes about ‘Miss Popularity’ to say he is not alone in believing that the program is ‘rapidly turning our town into the laughing stock of Australia’.</p>
<p>He goes on to mention some of the events which he considers to be ‘in such shocking bad taste that I can only hope that New Zealand viewers will switch off their TV sets as soon as it goes to air’.</p>
<p>Letter. Felicity Martin writes at some length defending her views about wind farms, citing her credentials as a member of a family with local roots going back nearly 150 years. She condemns the effect on the environment that the development of the wind farms will have.</p>

<p>Letter. Simon Jaffer writes a very long letter about the debate over whether ‘Miss Popularity’ is a good or a bad thing. He accuses critics of writing about things of which they have little knowledge. His family has been host to two and later three of the girls. He found them to be intelligent, well balanced and level headed enough to cope with the demands of the rigorous and sometimes stressful situations they were placed in for the sake of the TV program. As for the complainants –</p>
<p>‘&hellip;some of these same individuals, on occasion, whine and bitch about anything that does not fall within their own sterile comfort zone or which disrupts their peaceful existence.’</p>
<p>‘At the end of the day it is only a TV program.’</p>
<p>He goes on to suggest that as a tourist town, Burra can only benefit from the publicity for some years to come.</p>
<p>As for ‘lewd’ comments, they have been shouted from crowds for eons.</p>
<p>And the suggestion of Narcissism might as well apply to the individual writing letters two weeks running proclaiming the ‘immorality’ of the event.</p>
<p>Ask the 350 or more members of the community who gather at Morphett’s Enginehouse every second night to be part of it, what they think. Ask the school what they think of the money donated to them – or the Leisure Activity Group or the Kindergarten.</p>
<p>‘You people are in the minority that suck the enjoyment out of some relatively harmless fun for the rest of us.’</p>
<p>James Said writes a sarcastic letter praising Dr Cross and concluding –</p>
<p>‘As we wait for Dr Cross’ solutions to all the problems we suffer in this town we are all sure Dr Cross is a pro-active individual with a positive attitude, with a bright outlook for the town of Burra (which he seems to be concerned with) not just a disgruntled retiree.</p>
<p>Dr Cross mabe [sic] you could write positively for a change and surprize [sic] us all.’</p>

<p>Letter. Alistair McPhee writes with a somewhat different take on the ‘Miss Popularity’ series.</p>
<p>‘Australians have no dignity left to lose, if loss of dignity is defined by a modicum of curiosity in the production of an ironically named ‘reality television’ program.’</p>
<p>Witness Big Brother, The Block or Survivor to name but three.</p>
<p>The girls involved are responsible for their dignity – or lack thereof – not the ill-informed judgement of a condescending philosopher.</p>
<p>The public enjoy these shows due to their ‘schadenfreude’ nature and it has always been so. While Australians may have to live down presentations of themselves in some ghastly portrayals, the ocker image is easier to live down than one as a ‘complicit human rights abuser’.</p>
<p>The phenomenon will be around for many years to come, is bigger than Burra and so we should be grateful to</p>
<p>‘&hellip;suckle at the teat of the great scripted behemoth and use the nurturing it provides to further improve our spirited town.’</p>
<p>Letter. Sharyn Roberts writes to say that Mr Cross is in the minority and Burra has embraced the idea of this TV show. Can 500 or more locals be wrong in joining in the elimination nights and the traders are reaping the reward of the crew being in town. More than likely tourism will also benefit.</p>
<p>Letter. Dick Cleland writes to say he began with an initial antipathy to ‘reality TV’ and decided to shun all the events. The correspondents alerted him to the loss of dignity to contestants and the desecration of heritage monuments etc. so he decided to see for himself. He found the elimination nights not undignified at all – happy pensioners relaxed in deck chairs, excited school children, poised, eloquent and well-dressed contestants and a crowd much more dignified than at a football match. So ‘&hellip;have a bit of fun while it lasts; acknowledge the financial benefit to the town, but please do not take yourselves too seriously’.</p>
<p>Letter. Jennifer Carter writes in response to Mr Bence’s attack on Dr Roger Cross. She picks up on Mr Bence’s comment of Dr Cross as ‘a newcomer with views to residency’ and a sneering reference to his education ‘with perhaps a few letters after his name’. She says Mr Bence dismisses the merits of Australian Tertiary Education. She has noticed the tendency of longer term residents to attack any newcomer who presumes to express opinions that fail to match their own.</p>

<p>Letter. James Gosse of Hallett writes in support of wind farms, because they will give a struggling community some money and people that it needs.</p>

<p>A Touchdown Television Crew based in New Zealand has been in Burra for four weeks to film ‘Miss Popularity 2005’. On Friday night the winner was voted for by a 650 strong crowd at Morphett’s Enginehouse. A local recipient of half the prize money was also selected. Miss Popularity winner, Jesse welcomed local identity Di Day to the stage to receive $50,000.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday night the weather forced voting indoors to the Town Hall, which was filled to overflowing. Storms and torrential rain continued throughout the district. On Thursday the girls were taken into Basin Farm for a shoot with the storm as background. The 50-strong crew was accommodated locally for the month, catered for by the Golf Club and transported around by numerous individuals.</p>
<p>Contestants were hosted by local families. Apart from prizes won by individuals, local charities and community bodies were often recipients of fundraisers instigated by the production team. The crew had received favourable reports from their scouts that the town could provide what they needed for the show. [4 colour photos.]</p>

(Noise reduction and wall partitioning.) $500,000 has been allocated by DECS for roof replacement, to be completed in two stages. Air conditioning and heating will be improved. $160,000 has been allocated to the redevelopment of the science labs, occupational health &amp; safety etc. and c. $10,000 has been allocated for external painting.</p>

<p>Letter. Bob Skinner writes to express his appreciation of the array of correspondence in last week’s Broadcaster. He deplores however, the tendency of too many to demean themselves by negative and personal criticism of people in Burra who have opposing views to their own. The denigration and abuse of Dr Cross by most of the correspondents was most unfortunate and illustrates an appalling lack of positive debate. It appears that it is the general opinion of most people that winning at any cost and criticising by downgrading your opponent is part of the scheme of life. This is part of reality TV that appalled Bob.</p>
<p>He says that while well aware of the monetary benefits to Burra of the television program, the example set by this type of program, especially to young people is not one that encourages respect for other members of the community.</p>

<p>Letter. L.J. Sullivan of Hallett writes to congratulate Burra on being such a good host to the New Zealand girls and their crews and at the same time show casing Burra and district to the media. Not only did the show provide some fun and excitement, but it also injected some well-earned money and prizes into the community.</p>
<p>‘What a contrast to the few peddlers of negativity some of us have had to read in recent days.’</p>
<p>Letter. Karen O’Brien writes about Nathaniel O’Brien (8), saying he sang for the ‘Touchdown’ production on 6 December, entertaining the people of Burra, the Miss Popularity contestants and the production crew at Morphett’s Enginehouse prior to the elimination of one of the girls. He also sang in his own home to winner Jesse, which will be televised back in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Weather. Storms lashed the district in the past week with falls of up to 6 inches [152 mm] Burra Creek has been running a banker producing erosion and washaways. Out east it filled most dams. The Council requests that only essential traffic use the eastern roads as many of them are in bad repair, especially at creek crossings. A tree blocked the highway at the entrance to the town from Adelaide and a small number of homes in the Best Place area were flooded. The door to the Royal Exchange bar was sandbagged as a precaution, as were a couple of houses in Tregony Street and a tarpaulin was needed for a roof of a house in Ludgvan Street.</p>

<p>Burra History</p>
<p>[Reprint of an article by Brad Crouch in the Sunday Mail. It outlines the origins and importance of the town in the nineteenth century and mentions some of the sites of interest to the modern tourist. The editor adds that we have seen Burra chosen as the site for the filming of Breaker Morant and as the backdrop for [the New Zealand TV show] Miss Popularity 2005 and as the location for the latest Qantas advertisement.</p>
<p>BUT note that Brad Crouch says:</p>
<p>‘The English, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish and Irish miners were not keen to integrate and instead set up separate enclaves, which today make up the town.’</p>
<p>There is no historical basis for this assertion. Birth and deaths records for the relevant mining period, giving place of births and deaths do not show any such tendency for segregation. Any tendency to aggregation along lines of origin in different parts of the UK or elsewhere is weak and explicable for other reasons, such as place of employment. This myth is perpetuated without basis and probably grew from the street and place names rather than from any real evidence.]</p>

<p>AGL has secured development rights for a proposed 90-135 megawatt wind farm to add to generating capacity at its existing Hallett peaking power plant. Evaluation work is continuing in relation to the proposal announced in April 2004 to proceed with a $100 million+ expansion of the gas-fired plant, with a decision due in late 2005. Construction of the wind farm is scheduled to commence about July 2005, with completion in late 2006. Integration of the facilities will mean the existing gas-fired generating capacity at Hallett will be able to provide adequate back-up support to the wind farm, enabling continuous operation of the expanded power station during periods of high electricity demand.</p>

The show relocated to the present site in 1923. [Actually 1924.] Isaac Warnes with a donation of 30 acres and others with cash donations enabled the show to move from the Aberdeen Oval where it had been held since 1909. The Society was formed as the Burra and North Eastern Agricultural, Horticultural and Pastoral Society and ran annual shows from 1877 to 1886, after which there was a recess until 1894.</p>
<p>The Monster Mine. The historic open cut will be open for the Burra Jazz in the Monster Mine event this coming Saturday night. A crowd of several hundred is expected to enjoy the night of entertainment with feature jazz bands from Adelaide. In days gone by the old open cut was accessible to locals and used as the local swimming pool. [i.e. the open cut from the nineteenth century mine – before the modern mining operations of the 1970s.] Nowadays the spectacular view from water level can only be seen by Saturday night’s crowd. The man-made lake is as big as a football field and stays full at the natural ground water level, being 50 m deep. The SA Diving School scoured the state for a site with more than 30 m of clear water with no interference from the weather and finally hit on Burra. They use the venue for teaching new scuba divers. The Burra National Trust has leased the mine site from the Council and maintains the historic sites such as Morphett’s Enginehouse and the Powder Magazine. They have an increasing problem with the Aleppo Pines self-seeding and invading the site at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>Burra’s Jailhouse Rock event attracted record crowds for its seventh year. The Friday night dance in the Burra Town Hall attracted 90 people. Saturday morning saw Paul O’Bryan’s Band provide the music for enthusiastic Rock ’n’ Roll dance demonstrations in Market Square. On Saturday night a record crowd of 270 enjoyed a balmy evening at Redruth Gaol with music by Paul O’Bryan’s Band and Adelaide band Jump ’n’ Jive. About 180 attended Sunday’s brunch by the Burra Creek. [Photos.]</p>

<p>Friends of Burra Parks held its AGM 17 February. Elected: President, Heidi Nicholson; Vice-President, Harvey Neal; Secretary, Ann Breeding; Safety Officer, Barry Wright; Publicity Officer, Sally Fieldhouse and Treasurer, Arthur Simpson (subject to his consent).</p>
<p>The meeting voted to donate $250 to Gluepot Reserve and to allocate $1,000 to a Weeds Workshop.</p>
<p>The Burra Parks include: Caroona Creek, Hopkins Creek, and the three Conservation Parks; Mokota, Pandappa and Redbanks.</p>
<p>The group had visited all and discussed possible projects with rangers.</p>
<p>For 2004 Redbanks was a focus because of its chequered history and variety of past users.</p>
<p>It was an early resting place for sheep on the stock rout to Burra from NSW as well as the north and northeast of SA – because of its permanent water.</p>
<p>Later its recreational oval was a focal point for the community for picnics and cricket matches at weekends.</p>
<p>Later still it was favoured by motor cycle riders and campers.</p>
<p>Now its significance for its fossil deposits and Aboriginal heritage is increasingly recognised.</p>
<p>In 2004 native grasses and trees were propagated and despite dry conditions the survival rate had been better than 60%. The old oval had been revegetated and in the future walking trails will be upgraded and signage improved. Further plantings are planned to be co-ordinated with pest plant control (horehound, pepper trees, artichokes and bamboo) and with feral animal control (foxes, rabbits, goats and hares.)</p>

<p>Princess Royal Feedlot</p>
<p>A feedlot for 1,500 head was given provisional development consent by Goyder Council’s Development Assessment Panel last week. It would enable Simon Rowe’s Princess royal property to finish up 1,000 lambs and 1,350 cattle at any one time. The plan is for eight cattle pens and two dual purpose pens covering a 6.43 ha area. It includes a manure storage area 115 x 50 m, a sedimentation pond of 1.3 mega litres, a storage lagoon of 10.5 mega litres and a feed mill. The plan is a for a controlled drainage area able to handle two one in a hundred year floods within the controlled area. The site is four km south of Burra. Representations concerning environmental issues were made by Roger Cross, Jenny Carter, Burra Creek Land Care Group, Yorke Mid North Consultative Committee, Lindner’s Wonga Pastoral Co. and Graham Whetstone. They were concerned about possible impacts on the quality and quantity of water in the Burra Creek and on ground water supplies and quality. The Environmental Protection Authority has deemed the proposal ‘represents an acceptably low risk of environmental harm, provided it is designed, constructed and operated in accordance with the guidelines for the establishment and operation of feedlots in SA.</p>

<p>Thorogoods have added new products to their range of apple beers and ciders. ‘Billy B’s’ is an oak matured and bottle fermented apple beer, with a whopping 12% alcohol. It comes in two forms, the Billy B’s Golden and now Billy B’s Dark – the colour of Guinness, the tang of a Granny Smith and the sweetness of a Golden Delicious. Scrumpy is another product. In England this is a young rough cider and often contains bits of apple. Thorogood’s Scrumpy is a sophisticated drop. Bottled straight from the barrel, it comes in a popular sweet and also in an extra dry version.</p>
<p>The Bon Accord Hotel took advantage of the Liquor Licensing Board allowing all night trading in conjunction with the Clipsal 500. ‘The Bon’ had customers all night for both nights of the weekend. The previous weekend ‘The Bon’ had a fire truck party and raised $175 for the local CFS.</p>

<p>Letter. Danny smith writes questioning the controls and restrictions placed on the Trade Winds Caravan dealership in Best Place. Has the Council gone too far in limiting business opportunity?</p>
<p>Letter. Graham Whetstone writes questioning the positive response to the Princess Royal feedlot. He is seriously concerned about water use. He says each 1,000 cattle require a minimum of 6,000 litres of water per day and so 4,000 cattle would need about a quarter of a million litres per day – plus the sheep and grapes.</p>
<p>[Something seems amiss here. Multiplying the number of cattle by four should multiply their requirements for water by four, to 24,000 litres rather than the 250,000 suggested. Also Princess Royal grapes were earlier reputed to be non-irrigated – had that changed?]</p>

<p>Accident. On Wednesday 30 March at 6.45 a.m. a fuel tanker carrying c. 23,000 litres of unleaded petrol and diesel rolled over onto its side in Copperhouse Street, Burra, and as a result the road was closed from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. that day and several nearby houses were evacuated because of the leaking fuel. The driver sustained minor shoulder injuries. MFS, CFS and SES crews were all involved. A recovery unit from Adelaide attended to transfer the fuel to another tanker and a crane came from Clare to recover the prime mover and trailer, damage to which was estimated at c. $200,000.</p>
<p>The 6th Annual National Youth Week (NYW) will run from 9-17 April. Goyder YAC has organised an open air party as its NYW event. It will be at the Burra Show Grounds 9 April from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. Entry will be free of charge. All youth 12-25 are welcome. The committee is aware of the difference in age of young people eligible to attend and has tried to cater for all within that age range. Attendance for only part of the night is expected for many of the younger youth.</p>
<p>Goyder Council has had a series of meetings over the last week to hear public reaction to Goyder Council’s Rate Review Committee. At Burra there was dissatisfaction that the Council was not working towards rate parity for Burra Town area as promised when the Councils merged in 1997. Ex Councillor Chris Red said that not only was the Burra town rate higher, but also valuations there for equivalent houses were higher compared with other towns. There were also inconsistencies; for example three-quarters of the cost of the Burra Community Activity Centre was to be borne by Burra Town, but Robertstown Day Care costs would be borne by the whole Council area, including Burra Town.</p>
<p>Bryna Dunow, of Burra, a member of the Rate Review Committee, and a retired property valuer of the Valuer General’s Office, voiced his opposition to the idea that unique service costs should be used as the basis for differential rating, saying it ignored the proposed rating model for the amalgamation of Councils, that rate parity should be achieved no later than 2006-07.</p>
<p>Council resolved:</p>
<p>Rates to be based on capital valuations.</p>
<p>That there would be a fixed charge.</p>
<p>That differential rates would be based on land use codes.</p>
<p>That differential rates would be based on twelve localities: Rural, Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie, Terowie, Burra, Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Robertstown, Point Pass, Eudunda and Hampden.</p>
<p>That unique service costs for townships be the basis for differential rating.</p>
<p>That the fixed charge would increase from the present 18% to 30% of the general revenue within 8 years.</p>
<p>That there be a maximum of 12% increase for each locality over a period of 5 years until all localities achieve the required rate in the dollar.</p>
<p>That the STEDS charge would be retained.</p>
<p>That there would be a waste collection charge.</p>

<p>Letter. Paul Wilson writes re the recent Goyder Council Rates Review Committee public meeting. He says the meeting was well run, but he left feeling it was only a formality and that all the decisions had already been made. He also felt that some Councillors had a very narrow view – being only concerned with the betterment of their own area, without taking a whole region view.</p>
<p>Letter. Chris Reed writes suggesting there are two questions Burra ratepayers should ask their Councillors:</p>
<p>What is the reason for the differential rates? (Burra 0.6662 cents in the dollar and Eudunda 0.38 cents in the dollar) What justifies it?</p>
<p>When the Councils amalgamated [in 1997] it was a commitment that the Council would work towards a rate parity over ten years – why has nothing like that been achieved?</p>
<p>The Rate Review Report seeks to address the first question with its unique service charge proposal, which if adopted will again penalise Burra with another unfair tax on top of the already flawed differential.</p>

Now 81, Tony was born in Burra and was a rouseabout before becoming a shearer. He later became a contractor and then Senior Instructor in the SA Department of Agriculture. He subsequently joined the Australian Wool Board, which became the Australian Wool Corporation. He spent 22 years instructing young shearers. As well as shearing techniques, he concentrated on physical fitness, repairs and maintenance of shearing equipment, industrial relations law and health and safety issues. At BCS an invitation was issued for some sort of commemorative art work and a handsome sculpture resulted of the outline of a shearer shearing a sheep with the backdrop of an old style wool bale with Tony Ryan stencilled on it along with the dates for which he was a shearer – 1943-65. Peter Reilly donated the old style wool bale and Andy Thomas the wool and a pair of hand shears was also donated. The sculpture will be transported to Hay by the art teacher Roger Boehm for the induction. [Photo of students with the sculpture.]</p>
<p>Goyder Council is aware of the desire of ratepayers to see a properly appointed industrial area set aside in Burra and an area adjacent to Adchem is being considered. It would of course need water laid on and three phase power. Funds will be sought for planning and discussion with Adchem will follow along with ownership of roads in the area etc.</p>

<p>Letter. Glenys Christopher &amp; Bob Skinner write to counter the advice apparently being circulated by some locals that the property at Ford’s Corner has a sanctuary agreement on it that renders it useless for other purposes. It is important to note that there are different categories of sanctuary status. One type that is to ensure that existing native vegetation remains untouched is forever and is so noted on the title. The agreement for Ford’s Corner is not listed in the title and may be de-gazetted by its owner at anytime. It allows grazing while demonstrating that the owner will do all they can to preserve the native species on the property and prevent damage to the land.</p>

<p>Tony Ryan will be guest speaker at an assembly at BCS on 10 June. A month ago Tony was inducted into the Shearers’ Hall of Fame in Hay, NSW. To mark the occasion some students under the direction of Roger Boehm and some members of the community made a striking sculpture of a shearer, which Roger then took to Hay for the induction. Tony began shearing in 1943 at Middlebank Station near Broken Hill and he continued shearing and contracting around South Australia for the next twenty years. In 1963 he became a shearing instructor in Sa Department of Agriculture, spending the next 22 years instructing young shearers in shearing skills, fitness and the repair and maintenance of shearing equipment. He was also active in industrial relations issues and law and in occupational health and safety. He eventually joined the Australian Wool Board (later the Australian Wool Corporation).

<p>Fire. At 2.20 a.m. on Sunday morning passing youths raised the alarm that the BCS meat bird shed was on fire. The steel-framed shed, normally full of meat birds grown by the students for sale, was empty. An electrical malfunction is believed to have caused the fire, which produced about $10,000 damage. Chickens in the nearby fowl shed escaped harm, even though the heat was sufficient to melt their shed door. The pigs in a shed only three metres away also escaped harm and surprisingly the open hay shed, which was within a metre also survived. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Letter. Bill Stockman, President and Trevor Willis, Head Trainer on behalf of BBH Football Club Committee respond to an article in the Sunday Mail of 5 June that claimed the taking of ‘No Doz’ tablets was rife in the BBH Senior Colts team. The letter makes the points:</p>
<p>The comment that empty tablet packets were strewn about the clubrooms is not only malicious, but also not correct. Trevor Willis and Chris Taylor sweep out the rooms after every home match and have seen no evidence of that.</p>
<p>It is upsetting that such accusations would be taken to the media before the club had any chance to research them.</p>
<p>The club has no doubt that there may be isolated use of these particular tablets, which incidentally are not illegal in any club.</p>
<p>Media articles such as this only raise the awareness of such so-called performance enhancing tablets.</p>
<p>SANFL is investigating and will make a statement in due course.</p>
<p>Editor Terry Wilson also writes in support of the club and accuses the report and television football shows of encouraging copy-cat practices. While the effect of ‘No Doz’ is little different from heavy coffee usage, the habit of popping pills is not a healthy one.</p>

The Council Depot is non-compliant with occupational health and safety legislation.

<p>BCS. Eleven of Burra’s teachers joined the state-wide strike on Tuesday. They were arguing for better wages for teachers – saying that SA should pay education workers at least at the midpoint nationally. They were also objecting to the rounding up formula in funding teaching positions, which meant that Burra would lose 0.4 of a position or $40,000. The government’s proposed wage increase of 14% over three years would place SA second to bottom nationally. They are seeking 16.5%.</p>

<p>Vandalism &amp; Anti-Social Behaviour Meeting</p>
<p>A public meeting was held to consider a response to the many complaints from people at the Burra Caravan Park about noise and harassment at night. About 45 people attended. The toilets in Pickett Reserve are a frequent target for vandalism. Council Chairman, Laurie Sullivan said Council was considering a dry zone along the creek, though this could make it awkward for everyone else. One of the problems the police face was that people were prepared to complain, but not to make a statement and stand up in court. Providing somewhere else to go at night would be a more positive response. It was also asked what state people were in when they left the hotels. It was suggested that a shift was needed in community attitudes to alcohol and binge drinking, which was in epidemic proportions. The presence of kids as young as 12 or 13 at the creek late at night brought up the question of parental responsibility and supervision. It was finally resolved that the Council would co-ordinate a group with representatives from the YAC, the school, parents, police and tourism to work on immediate and longer term solutions.</p>

Some residents subscribe to Austar or to the Imparja satellite system, but neither is really satisfactory if you want live sports coverage.</p>
<p>John Ferguson, Assistant Chief Engineer at Southern Cross 10 says they are definitely going to be transmitting SC10 in Burra. Some of the necessary equipment is already in Pt Pirie, but the problem is a broadcast site in Burra. The site owner wants about twenty times the floor space rental as for the old Channel 4 transmitter. If the impasse is not soon resolved SC10 may have to establish its own transmitting site.</p>

<p>The Burra Community &amp; Sports Club Ladies’ Auxiliary was disbanded on 21 June.</p>
<p>The complex opened in October 1982 after a sustained period of fundraising. Much of the money came from the men’s group who had a contract for garbage collection and the women who provided teas for Council meetings and catered for other occasions. The Auxiliary started in July 1983 and set about acquiring crockery, cutlery, a deep freeze and other necessities for catering. It took out a loan to get a gas oven and deep fryer – still in great condition more than twenty years later. They were catering for weddings and special dinners as well as regular night meals after home matches, where from 140 to 200 meals were commonly served. As time went by the numbers dwindled. In 1989 the building was debt free. When a fire destroyed the building in 1991, most of the kitchen equipment was salvaged and within six months the facility was again up and running. Since then just a handful of ladies, assisted by members of the community, has worked and re-equipped the complex.</p>

<p>This building was under threat of demolition, but Danny O’Bryan has renovated it and converted it to a residence with a mezzanine floor and a balcony over the footpath. Mr O’Bryan also obtained some extra land behind to make the site a practical proposition for a small residence. He made extensive use of recycled timber and retained some of the old cobblestone floor. Goyder Council Heritage Officer, John Brak, praised Mr O’Bryan’s efforts.</p>

<p>Market Square &amp; Best Place Redevelopment Plans</p>
<p>The master plan concepts for this redevelopment were adopted by Council in September 2004 and now the final plans are on display in the Council Foyer. The plans were the outcome of investigation and community consultation by Hames Sharley, a firm of consultants.</p>
<p>The project was jointly funded by Council and Planning SA through the Places for People Program that aims to assist communities in developing and implementing attractive and safe local activity centres. Kelly Brown &amp; Root Pty Ltd has now been contracted to implement the second stage of the project. This will see the master plan developed into final engineering design plans as the basis for actual work.</p>

<p>Goyder Council invited community consultation on Monday night concerning planning issues and three BCS students produced a Powerpoint display: Chelsea Evans, Kay Carpenter and Bridget Hallion. Some of their points:</p>
<p>Concerning the Town Hall – no one knows what is going on.</p>
<p>The railway station is going to rack and ruin.</p>
<p>The skateboard ramp is in the wrong place and would be much better located at the site of the old swimming pool – a site presently not used by anyone.</p>
<p>The Caravan Park would be better located between the old Court House and the Creek/St Just Street.</p>
<p>Another alternative site for the Caravan Park would be the old disused Aberdeen tennis courts.</p>
<p>The public area opposite Peacock’s Chimney is under-utilised because it has no amenities.</p>
<p>The crowd broke into groups to discuss things the Council needed to keep in mind when changing their development plan.</p>

<p>Internet. More than 250 people in Goyder have registered their wish to access the internet with a broadband service as well as cheaper STD phone calls in the future. This is up from 28 when the campaign started. The changes to internet access are being sought by Councils in the Central Local Government Region and the Broadband Demand Aggregation Program, which Goyder Council supports.</p>
<p>Goyder Council’s public meetings on changes to their Development Plan in Hallett, Farrell Flat and Booborowie heard that locals want services maintained and growth to be encouraged. Hallett might fare better as a ‘settlement zone’ rather than as a township. Farrell Flat is growing and a separate Planning Amendment Report might be needed to acknowledge this change – it is presently classified as a ‘settlement’, but may in future need to be considered as a ‘town’. Booborowie residents wanted the ability to attract industry and for rural subdivision rules to allow hobby farm type enterprises. The Terowie meeting failed to attract anyone.</p>
<p>Market Square &amp; Best Place Redevelopment. Council staff are getting a lot of constructive feedback – mostly on Market Square. The proposed changes should enhance the entrance to Burra and reduce the speed of vehicles through the area, create a landscaped area for interpretive signs and public art. There is potential for considerable impact on retail and commercial operations and Council is anxious for feedback from this group.</p>

<p>Letter. Vincent Burke of Burra writes congratulating young people of Burra for their efforts to offer a positive contribution to the debate on the future of the town as reported in recent issues of the Broadcaster. Having done market research and consulting work in some thirty rural towns, he says that all too often young people see only a bleak outlook in their towns and have done little to help themselves, so this response in Burra is a delight.</p>

<p>Burra Town Hall</p>
<p>Committee members and workers recently repainted the supper room and changed the slide on the kitchen counter to a lateral slide rather than a vertical one – much safer. There are plans to move the wooden partition that divides the foyer from the hall, so as to enlarge the foyer. It is hoped to move the large old projectors down into what was the Internet Room [originally the Lodge Room] and to decorate the walls with posters of old movies. Mary Warnes Room now has Council photos on the walls and Burra’s Jubilee 150 quilt. The committee will hold a supper recital on 23 September as a fundraiser towards ongoing refurbishment. The recital will feature Anna Legge, a final year B Mus. Student at the Elder Conservatorium and Graeme Burgan, pianist, vocalist and choral conductor. He is Musical Director of the Shine Choir, which visited Burra earlier in the year for the candlelit concert at St Mary’s.</p>

<p>Market Square &amp; Best Place Redevelopment Plans</p>
<p>Public feedback has been divided, but now a groundswell of opposition seems to be growing. A petition has been initiated that includes the names of two of Burra’s Councillors; Peter Reilly and Adrian Gill. A major concern seems to be the reduced number of parking spaces in front of the Burra Hotel and the cost of a project when people are satisfied with the present layout. The nearness of the rotunda to the road in the new plan has also been cited as a concern. Peter Reilly says a number of people fear the cost will simply be an excuse to jack up rates further. Council decided to go ahead with the plan last year. Once final details are decided the redevelopment will be put to consultation again. Stage 1 was to assess how design could improve commercial and residential use of public space. Stage 2 was to plan and prepare tender documentation. Stage 3 is to do the work. Council has been sufficiently impressed with the concept that they were willing to match Government funding to carry it out. Architects Hames Sharley say that the current design provides for 78 car parking spaces and the new design for 73. At a public display last year of three concept plans for Market Square, the one incorporating a car parking lane and two-way traffic on the Burra Hotel side of the square gained most favourable comment. That plan was then further developed into the master plan presented to Council on 28 July 2004. Market Square was changed to its present layout in the 1908s – previously traffic followed the curve of the buildings closely. There was serious opposition to the 1980s changes, culminating in protestors lying in front of machines.</p>

<p>Market Square &amp; Best Place Redevelopment</p>
<p>The petition against the changes in Market Square is growing. Opponents say:</p>
<p>The money could be better spent on kerbing, lighting or sewer extension.</p>
<p>Fewer parking spaces are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Footpaths and drains, especially in Burra North are more urgent items of expenditure.</p>
<p>The present arrangement is quite acceptable.</p>
<p>The Editor, Terry Wilson did some fence-sitting with his comments:</p>
<p>He had looked at the plans and liked the look of them.</p>
<p>BUT the rather belated opposition might just have a point if the changes are likely to lead to an increase in Burra rates.</p>
<p>Although the plans have merit, he is unconvinced and has an open mind.</p>
<p>He goes on to suggest other changes that are possible or desirable, perhaps in the long term:</p>
<p>The trees at the southern entrance to the town are unsightly and past their use-by date. They should be renewed.</p>
<p>Burra Caravan Park would be better located at Burra North between the old Court House and the creek.</p>
<p>Leighton Cricket Oval [i.e. Aberdeen Oval] would be better redeveloped as a site for the concentration of sporting activities: the football oval, the bowling club and the showgrounds. This would open the spaces those activities presently occupy for housing development/retirement housing.</p>
<p>[There is some irony in the suggestion to move the Burra Show to the Aberdeen Oval, since it was somewhat controversial to move it from there in 1923.]</p>

<p>Goyder Council has not reacted to the 400-name petition tabled at its last meeting, asking that the plans for Market Square not go ahead. However, in the most recent Council update it has said:</p>
<p>‘In general we are prepared only at this time to make minor amendments in harmony with the original (concept plan) in accordance with public consultation.’</p>
<p>The consultants have been briefed on the feelings of some of the local community and have offered to manage a public workshop on the Council’s behalf.</p>
<p>‘&hellip;while some members of the community are not prepared to accept the changes, others are more than happy that the sites and Burra will get a well needed face-lift, while maintaining the integrity of the heritage town.’</p>
<p>It is expected the basic design plans will be completed on 28 November.</p>
<p>Letter from Valerie Rivers – posing three questions about the Market Square redevelopment:</p>
<p>Who makes the decisions coming from the Council Chambers, elected members or paid employees?</p>
<p>Why can’t decisions that have been made be changed when enough qualified objections are raised?</p>
<p>How can restrictions of traffic flow and the lessening of the ease of parking increase commercial activity in Market Square?</p>

<p>Tiver Reunion</p>
<p>Over 250 descendants of James Tiver came to Burra Town Hall for a reunion on Sunday to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the arrival of James Tiver in Burra. There was a brief thanksgiving service and a group photograph as well as the expected speeches etc. Then the James Tiver Walk of Fame plaque was unveiled.</p>
<p>James Tiver of Bristol was one of four children born to Hugh Tiver and Rebecca nee Godwin. He had little schooling and went to work when aged about 8. He and his brother Charles learnt the trade of mason, though their father was a baker. James married Elizabeth South and had a son James Hugh, born at Newport and the young family sailed from Plymouth in the barque David Malcolm, arriving at Port Adelaide 30 April 1855. They were met by an uncle, James Rosser. A daughter Margaret Malcolm was born on the voyage. They came to Burra by bullock dray and put up a two-roomed wattle and daub hut near the ford [now a bridge] in Young Street. Elizabeth died of tuberculosis [29 November 1856] and James later [7 February 1858] married Emma Price, who had come from Plymouth in the Alloquis in 1856. James built the middle house on the row [on the north side of Truro Street] in Redruth and most of the ten children of his second family were born there. With Emma’s help he added houses either side of the first to make a row now known as Tiver’s Row. He did contract work for the Burra Mine for about two years and carrying business between Pt Adelaide and Burra. In 1870 he built the house and store in Aberdeen where the family then lived.</p>
<p>Emma and James Hugh ran the store, while James continued with contracting work, having up to 100 men employed by him at times. He helped to build the Wallaroo Smelting Works, macadamised roads in the Burra district, the Aberdeen Ford, Redruth Bridge, the Burra Institute, the station yards and station and railway houses from Tarlee to Farrell Flat. James opened a branch store at Hallett after the railway reached there in 1878 and later took up land at McVitties Flat, Hallett, Banbury, and with his sons, Pat’s Well, Yunta (later known as ‘Tiverton’). James was a Town Councillor [December 1883 to November 1887], a JP, Superintendent of the [Redruth Wesleyan/Methodist] Sunday School and an office bearer in the [Redruth Methodist] Church for many years. He was also connected with the Oddfellows and Masonic Lodges for most of his life.</p>
<p>[The list of buildings etc. attributed to James Tiver should not be taken at face value. They need to be checked carefully. Two observations indicate the care needed:</p>
<p>The Redruth Bridge that is still there, although disused, dates from 1879. It is a steel bridge and was erected by Duncan Grant. It replaced a timber bridge erected in 1861, for which Tiver constructed the masonry abutments. It may be that these abutments were used again for the replacement bridge.</p>
<p>James Tiver got the contract for the last half mile of the railway line into the Burra Station and associated work. He seems to have been responsible for the platforms/wharfs and may well have been responsible for the 1870 railway station. BUT the existing railway station was erected only in 1883 by Sara &amp; Dunstan.]</p>

<p>Burra History Group meets monthly to research, record, promote and bring to prominence the history of the town and district. Members share the results of their researches and there are occasional guest speakers intermixed with working bees on group projects. The emphasis is on the collecting and collating of historical information and photographs for the period after the closure of the Mine in 1877, given that Ian Auhl focussed his extensive research on the mining period. Resources are the materials in the History Room at the Burra Community Library, and original copies of the Burra Record held by the National Trust. Eric Fuss is working on the huge task of summarising the 100 years of the Burra Record. In five years he has summarised the paper from 1876 to 1943. The period 1876 to 1910 has been typed up and is searchable on computer. It runs to more than 2,000 A4 pages so far. Meredith Satchell has been compiling a Burra Families Database for the last eight years. This contains the birth, marriage and death information for more than 25,000 people with a Burra connection. It is still very much a work in progress. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Obituary. Brian Alfred Riggs DFC</p>
<p>Brian was born 13 January 1921 at his parents’ home at Burra North near the Railway Station. His parents were Alfred &amp; Myrtle Riggs. Just before Brian started school, the family moved to their new home ‘Kabymur’ a Californian bungalow on Smelts Road, where he lived on and off for the rest of his life. Brian attended Burra Primary School and Burra High School, where he obtained his Intermediate Certificate. He then went to Prince Alfred College for 1936-38. He repeated his Leaving year because he felt he had not done himself justice. He easily duxed the school the second year and won the Samuel Churchwood Scholarship at the end of 1937. He was School House Prefect in 1938. Brian then returned to Burra to join his father and become a grazier. The Mt Bryan property was bought. He played tennis at Aberdeen and some football at Burra before war intervened. Brian volunteered in 1941 and joined the RAAF. He trained at Mt Breckon Victor Harbor, Parafield and Point Cook, Victoria. He flew twenty-eight bombing raids over Europe until April 1943. On his first trip as Captain, to Frankfurt, the back of his plane was badly shot up and he lost his rear gunner. The rudder and electric circuits were ruined and they couldn’t get rid of their bombs. They limped back and landed with a full bomb load. Brian never lost another crew member even though his plane was often badly damaged. In April 1944 he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross by King George VI at Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>After the war Brian married Lucy Eleanor Rosewarne in 1948 and they went to live at Murkaby. They had four children: Richard Brian, David Russell, Geoffrey Kym and Jillian Margaret. Like his father, Brian was heavily involved in community affairs. He was a committee member, President and Life Member of the Show Society, Councillor and Deputy Chairman of the Burra Burra District Council, RSL Past President and current Treasurer, a JP, Past Master of Kooringa Masonic Lodge, a Member of the Grand Lodge, Member of the Royal Agricultural Society, Merino Sheep Steward at the Royal Adelaide Show, Eastern Zone Representative of the Stockowners’ Association and a Member, Club Champion and Life Member of the Burra Bowling Club.</p>

<p>Letter. Danny Smith writes in to explain the recent roadworks on the western extension of Stock Street and around a trouble spot on Vineyard Terrace. The Council undertook the work at his request to stop storm water from entering his property and to allow good access to his shed to house recent purchases he wished to see sheltered. He was grateful that his vehicles would no longer be damaged seeking access to the shed and the work should prevent any legal intervention if storm water created further damage to his property.</p>

<p>Letter. C. Tiver of Burra writes that she and her brother, Don, met recently with Joan Sutton nee Davies and her two daughters, Kerry &amp; Lindy, when they came to celebrate Joan’s 60th birthday. This visit sparked memories of Burra during WWII. Some of the memories that were recalled were:</p>
<p>Joan was one of the aeroplane spotters who operated from an observatory located in a building behind Matthews Emporium, where Décor Made Easy currently stand on Market Square.</p>
<p>[In 1910 the premises of the Burra Record in Market Square, which included a photographic studio, were destroyed by fire. It took almost three months to return the paper to production in Burra and the photographic studio was also replaced as reported in the first issue of the paper after the fire: 13 July 1910, page 2 -</p>
<p>The photographic studio is now being rebuilt two storeys high* to become one of the largest and best lit studios anywhere. [*But note that the report in the paper of 17 Aug. 1910, page 3 describes a three storey building, which photographs would seem to verify.</p>
<p>This building later fell into disuse and was available for the aeroplane spotters.</p>
<p>The Burra Record of 19 Dec. 1950, page 1 reported another fire:</p>
<p>Part of the back premises of Matthew’s Emporium burnt down during lunch hour yesterday. Mostly the fire was confined to the two storey wood and iron building once used as a photographic studio. The high narrow structure acted like a chimney. Ray Bevan raised the alarm and volunteers did well salvaging lino, furniture and men’s clothing from fire and water damage.]</p>
<p>Miss Essie Brice was another of the spotters, who manned the observatory 24 hours a day in shifts.</p>
<p>There were many memories of musical performances of the period and of Joan’s participation in tap dancing acts under the leadership of Mrs Rae Corry.</p>
<p>Joan’s father, Viv Davies, ran the Burra Bacon Factory, located where McPhee’s butcher shop now operates. [2 Market Street.]</p>
<p>An ice works was already there in operation when her father bought the business and they continued to make ice and send it to customers by train, wrapped in hessian and packed in sawdust to preserve it.</p>
<p>The pigs were slaughtered at ‘Cactus Farm’ [Section 1 Block 17 at the southern entrance to the town], where Sid Johnson and his family lived.</p>
<p>Ted Motheral and a Mr Spackman worked for Joan’s father, as did Joan and her husband, Ian Sutton.</p>

<p>‘This week marks 75 years since gold mining started at Mongolata,</p>
<p>and the following has been written for the Broadcaster by Steve Boyes</p>
<p>Gold was known to be in the area since at least 1908 when it is alleged that Mr T. Hawkins, a shearer and prospector, found gold between Newikie Creek and the site of the mines. It was also known that Ted Bywater had been fossicking for gold in the area for about 25 years.</p>
<p>Harry Byles was an unemployed Station Manager who had been working for Mr I.J. Warnes. He had permission from Mr George Morgan of Wildildie to prospect on his property and found gold on Section 36W on the east side of the Mongolata Hills. This was first reported in the Burra Record of 26 November 1930. The Mining lease for &ldquo;Byles Mongolata&rdquo; was issued on 1 January 1931. This later became the Byles Mongolata Gold Mining Co. which acquired many of the other leases as they became vacant.</p>
<p>The find at Mongolata started a mini gold rush with many claims being pegged around the Byles lease, mostly by local people, and within a short of time over 100 men were working out there on about 40 leases over a 5 mile strike length.</p>
<p>In 1930 the world was in the middle of the Great Depression. South Australia was almost bankrupt and the Federal Government was not in a much better state. Thousands were unemployed throughout the country with over 120 men in Burra. There was no such thing as the dole in those days and these men and their families existed on rations provided by the Government and distributed by the police and the local Council.</p>
<p>Conditions on the field were primitive with people living in tents or dugouts and there was little water in the area. They had few tools and equipment, no suitable clothing or footwear, and no money to buy them.</p>
<p>Some of the gold was in small nuggets which could be handpicked but, as there were no facilities to treat ore at Mongolata, the rest had to be sent in bags by rail to the battery at Peterborough. After lobbying of Government by State and Federal MPs and the Burra Council a battery was installed at Mongolata which opened on 2 March 1933.</p>
<p>In May 1931 the Mongolata Gold Prospectors’ Association was formed to &ldquo;watch the interests of the prospectors both on and off the field and do anything to assist the development of the field&rdquo;. This led to lobbying the Burra Council, Mines Dept. and the State Government for help with such things as tools, clothing, explosives, water supply, increased rations and, most important, investment by businessmen in Adelaide. These met with limited success as illustrated by the provision of a First Aid Kit from the Mines Dept. consisting of two bandages, l/4lb of boracic acid and a tourniquet.</p>
<p>Over the next few years conditions gradually improved for the men. In June 1932 the Mongolata Sports Association was formed, tennis courts and a cricket pitch were built with fixtures being played against teams from surrounding area, and the annual Sports Day started with athletics and cycle races. In July 1934 Bill Carpenter opened a store out there, and later a boarding and eating house providing accommodation and meals for the miners.</p>
<p>The Mines Dept. records show that up to 1947, 7,578 tons of ore from the field were treated and 10,864 oz. of gold produced, which at today’s gold price would be worth around $7,000,000. This does not include any ‘specimen’ gold which was not reported. The peak year was 1933 when 2,490 oz. were produced, 40% of the SA gold production.</p>
<p>The Byles’ Mine is now mined by Kevin Wallis. Tours of the mine and the battery can be arranged by booking at Mongolata Gold in Commercial Street. .’</p>
<p>BBH gets a new management team. At the AGM of the BBH Football Club last week Peter McGuinness was elected the new President and Wayne Clonan becomes the Secretary. Rob Sullivan continues as Treasurer. Shane Darwin and Andrew Dredge joined the committee.</p>

<p>Fire. CFS units from Burra, Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat tackled a fire in a large new hayshed with 500 bales of hay in it at Hanson on 22 November. The fire started while hay was being carted to the shed from a paddock and resulted in the destruction of a truck and trailer and 36 bales of hay. The destruction of the shed was averted. Damage was put at $150,000.</p>

<p>Mongolata Gold Field. Reprinted article from the Burra Record 26 November 1930. (75th anniversary)</p>
<p>In these depressed times a number of men have been putting in a lot of time prospecting in likely spots. One such was Mr George Morgan’s property and we understand that those prospecting these have at least struck a promising reef. It was discovered in a broken ref of ironstone and quartz and the specimens shown in Burra on Monday showed unmistakable signs of good coarse gold. The specks of gold were in many instances the size of a pin head, with some larger. On Monday morning Messrs Byles Senior &amp; Junior took a half kerosene tin of specimens to the city for assay. We did not get to inspect them, but we understand it was a real ‘find’. We are informed the prospect was found on a hill, most of which appears to be the same sort of formation. There are two parties, both of whom have struck gold on adjacent claims. Let us hope for the sake of the town and district that the find is a really big one. One or two other claims have already been pegged out.</p>
<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery. A good crowd attended the Gallery’s AGM on Thursday 24 November. After the business meeting and election of officers the gathering thoroughly enjoyed the presentation of ‘Starry starry night’. Chairman of the Board, Peter Harvey said the Gallery had continued a policy of pursuing a diversity in exhibitions and always showing at least a representative sample of works by artists of the region. In addition there had been arrangements for touring exhibitions, either co-ordinated by the Gallery or from Country Arts SA. Attendance for the year was 3,844 adults and 153 children. Total income was $17,192.70 compared with $15,821.90 the previous year. Mr Harvey thought to be really viable the income needed to be in the range $20,000 to $30,000. He thanked the wonderful team of volunteers and the ‘hanging team’.</p>

<p>Goyder Heritage Fund is fully funded once more with the State heritage Fund’s $5,000 being matched by the Goyder Council to total $10,000. Owners of State Heritage listed properties can apply for assistance for works that conserve their properties.</p>
<p>Changes to the Heritage Act. The Heritage Act is soon to be known as the Heritage Places Act 1993 and will be supplemented by the Development (Sustainable Development) Amendment Bill 2005, which will make it simpler to change places from State to Local listing.</p>
<p>Goyder Council does not have any Local Heritage Places. The new system will see the State Heritage Authority replaced by a new SA Heritage Council and the State Heritage Fund by the SA Heritage Fund. The new Act will contain one central register to include Local Heritage Zones and it can now include movable objects. Fines for breeches of the new Act have risen to $120,000.</p>
<p>Really nothing changes for Burra because the State Heritage listing covers archaeological sites and artefacts, but will affect the rest of Goyder because a permit will be required for archaeological work anywhere in SA and there will now be reporting requirements for finds. Trade in artefacts illegally removed will be prohibited. Currently owners of State Heritage properties can benefit by having a reduction in the valuation of their properties and the new Act extends this to Local Heritage Places.</p>

<p>Feedlot Stopped</p>
<p>The Environment, Resources &amp; Development Court has reversed the Goyder Council’s decision to allow a feedlot to be established on Princess Royal. Judge Cole ruled on 23 November to uphold an appeal by Graham Whetstone and David Lindner against the decision of Council made on 15 March 2005. Mr Rowe said he would be appealing the court’s decision. Council planner John Brak said Council will meet on 20 December and will discuss whether it would participate in any further action. Judge Cole said the feedlot may be an acceptable land use in the general farming zone and was sufficiently remote from neighbours that it would not have a direct impact with noise, dust or appearance, but the question of the impact of taking ground water on surface and ground water had not been addressed. The court had not received evidence from the Observational Wells Network. Whetstone and Lindner presented evidence of declining water levels in bores and other evidence from expert witnesses suggested the water use presently in the Upper Burra Creek sub-catchment was unsustainable. The Council had not addressed itself seriously to water use and relied upon the EPA, which had not addressed it either.</p>

<p>Hallett Community Management Committee called a meeting on Monday to consider re-opening the Hallett Swimming Pool. Sixty people attended. The plastic liner needs replacing and a number of edge tiles have to be replaced. Quotes for the repairs are about $12,500. Last year the expenditure was about $12,000 and the income about $9,000. Many at the meeting felt that the HCMC should be able to accommodate this, given that it had an income and expenditure last year of about $27,000 and finished the year with nearly $47,000 in the bank. Goyder Council CEO Steve Kerrigan said the HCMC put in its application for ward funding late, so the Council had not been able to consider funding for repairs.</p>
<p>The Burra Town Hall Committee &amp; Burra History Group have organised a display of historic photographs in the Town Hall Supper Room this Saturday 10 December.

<p>About 70 people attended the opening of the display of historic Burra photographs in the Burra Town Hall supper room on the afternoon of 10 December. The display has been set up by the Burra History Group as a permanent feature of the Town Hall. The photos are for sale. Eric Fuss was acknowledged for researching and writing the stories and captions for the photos. The exhibition was opened by Nancy Pearce, who donated several of the pictures and whose great grandparents settled in Burra in 1848. She spoke of the Burra she knew as a young child – of floods and dust storms and the old swing bridge and of cattle being driven down Chapel Street to the slaughterhouse at the end of Ayers Street. President of the History Group, Meredith Satchell thanked those private individuals who had loaned photographs to be copied for display or had sponsored the frames.

<p>Issue 724, 14 December 2005, Supplement</p>
<p>4 page glossy advertising supplement on Elders Burra branch.</p>
<p>Page 1 introduces the current staff:</p>
<p>Territory Sales Manager Scott Christie who stated in Burra in July.</p>
<p>Customer Service Officer &amp; Real Estate Specialist Sharyn Roberts – 20 years with Elders &amp; 15 as CSO in Burra.</p>
<p>Merchandise Manager &amp; Agronomist Damien Sommerville, in Burra 31⁄2 years.</p>
<p>Merchandise Sales Specialist Tim Crick who came to Burra in May.</p>
<p>Branch Manager Damien Webb</p>
<p>[The accompanying photographs shows seven people – unnamed.]</p>
<p>Plus a support staff network.</p>
<p>Page 2 makes a couple of points about the history of the Burra branch:</p>
<p>The supplement celebrates the refurbishing of the office.</p>
<p>Elders began in Burra in 1890 in the then new handsome two storey building that is currently the Visitor Centre. [Clearly, given the data on managers on page 3 of the supplement, 1890 is when Elders moved to their new office, not when they started in Burra.]</p>
<p>Burra was then a prime farming district, but its production capacity was nothing like its modern ability.</p>
<p>By 1902 Burra was recognised as the principal livestock market in SA. Elders alone had yards to hold 40,000 sheep at a time.</p>
<p>Before going on to say how great the company is and how wonderful its range of services.</p>
<p>Page 3 lists some of the previous managers:</p>

<p>1926 Max Pearce</p>
<p>1937 R.H. Smith</p>

<p>Since 1960 there have been 8 managers:</p>

<p>Mongolata Gold Mines</p>
<p>Reprinted from the Burra Record of 3 December 1930.</p>
<p>Since our last issue reports from Mr George Morgan’s Property are most healthy. Samples we have seen, taken by Mr H.A. Byles from the property were studded with gold and subsequently must yield a hundred ounces to the ton. These came from an old claim, originally taken out by a prospector named Bywater, some four to five years ago. He has worked it intermittently, but not lately. This claim has now been registered by H.A. Byles, who has worked it since 8 October. The country is rugged and hilly. Mr Byles’ party this recent weekend was successful in getting two big stones weighing 16-18 pounds, showing distinctly what is known as bar gold.</p>
<p>Mr Rampton is another prospector very satisfied with his claim. There are currently 20 to 30 claims pegged out, but the difficulty is the lack of water, which has to be carted from Baldina Creek. We hear there are good prospects in a couple of other shows. The main gold has been found on the west side of the hill, but it is reported a prospector has found the metal on the east as well. In WA many miners have found rich pockets and have jumped to the conclusion they have ‘found it’, only to see their finds quickly peter out. However, the discoveries at so many places at Mongolata lead one to believe that something good has been struck. We understand the geologist says that the specimens shown to him were the best he had seen in SA. An interesting incident was related to us this week. It seems Mr John Moulden, now of England (and a brother of Sir Frank Moulden), who is connected with BHP, was staying some twenty years ago with the late F.T. Jones, a former well-known Mongolata pastoralist. Mr Moulder said in his opinion there was gold in three or four hills and took a number of samples to England for Assay. This statement from such a high authority shows there is just reason for optimism. The Misses Jones (late of Mongolata) are presently visiting the old country and are guests of Mr John Moulden. The stones we have seen will be on view in Mr F. Harris’s window this morning.</p>

<p>Fire</p>
<p>A fire started at c. 10 a.m. on 23 December on the edge of the Burra-Morgan Road 200 metres towards Burra North from Ford’s Corner. It raced across the back of Brewery Hill and jumped the Kooringa Road. Fanned by an 80 k.p.h. north wind, in two hours it had burnt a strip 10 km long south to Princess Royal. CFS scrambled two water bombing ‘Air Tractors’ and a helicopter followed. Eventually more than 700 personnel fought he fire to save eight farm houses from the blaze. As fire fighters struggled to save three houses on Princess Royal the wind shifted to the west and pushed the fire into inaccessible gullies and over the hills to the east on a 15 km front. Quick action by firefighting teams saved the houses on this western edge. Mopping up was mostly done within 48 hours, though some spots took several crews up to six days to completely extinguish. About 5,500 ha were burnt, of which about a third was unreaped crop. Surprisingly, only eight large animals were reported killed. The local management team of Andy Thomas, David Nourse and Chris Reed deserve a lot of praise for the work done under extreme pressure.</p>

<p>Letter. Sue Cochrane writes to congratulate Kimberly Brak, Nathan Phillips and everyone else who made Vacswim such a success this year.</p>
<p>Goyder Council had a serious problem two years ago with leakage from Burra effluent ponds. They fitted them with plastic liners and now they are doing too well, in that there is an excess of treated water they don’t know what to do with. It would be suitable for irrigation of a woodlot, but not for release into the creek. It will be considered as part of the Council’s long term plan.</p>
<p>Burra Christmas Pageant went ahead on 23 December despite the fire, but of course without the participation of police, ambulances, SES, CFS and MFS units. The other floats were there and of course Father Christmas.</p>

<p>Diprotodon Bones</p>
<p>Tourism Minister, Jane Lomax-Smith launched the Diprotodon display in the foyer of the offices of the Regional Council of Goyder at Burra. Professor Rod Wells provided background on the climate of the area some 70,000 years ago. Evidence suggests sea levels were low and temperatures were also low. The first humans may have arrived in this period of 63,000 to 70,000 years before the present. He said human use of fire probably played some role in the extinction of the mega fauna. Local District Ranger Ian Falkenberg said that in the early twentieth century up to 20,000 sheep per month travelled through the Redbanks area using stock routes from Broken Hill. The area was declared a reserve in 1968. Management problems saw the area handed over to the Burra Burra DC, but the difficulties persisted with off-road motorbikes, the dumping of cars, rough camping, wild parties and eventually a human tragedy. In 1990 the Council closed the area and sought to offload it. The Department of Environment and Heritage took it on and removed 150 car bodies, erected fences and signage and developed a management plan. The area is highly regarded for its fossil remains.</p>

<p>Letter. Doug Holly of Berri writes a long letter challenging assertions that galahs kill trees. Galahs and corellas have been chewing trees for millions of years and yet the trees survive. Pruning generally invigorates trees and shrubs. Is it not rather that the trees were already stressed or dying because of the state of the water table quality or town water run-off? He says there is no justification for the culling of these birds.</p>

<p>Burra’s Adchem has struck a deal to obtain copper cement from the Mountain of Light deposit near Copley. Mt Gunson Mines Pty Ltd, a sister company to Adchem, holds three leases in the Leigh Creek area and has come to an arrangement with Leigh Creek Copper Mines Pty Ltd, which has taken over the leases. The surging copper price has made this source viable after lying dormant for forty years. Leigh Creek Copper Mines spent more than $3 million drilling for 21,000 tonnes of the mineral. Prices reached $6,330 (AUD) a tonne last week.</p>
<p>High copper prices are not an unmixed blessing for Adchem, as they force up the price of its input, scrap copper and other raw materials needed for its output of copper oxide and copper carbonate.</p>
<p>Production in 2005 was c. 7,500 tonnes of copper oxide and 2,300 tonnes of copper carbonate – only slightly down on the previous year.</p>
<p>Wind Farm. Australia’s largest wind farm is to begin construction at Hallett in September this year, with commissioning due in December 2007. It will be a 95 megawatt plant alongside its existing 180 megawatt gas fired peaking power station west of Hallett – at a cost of c. $236 million.</p>

<p>THE LAST ISSUE OF THE BURRA BROADCASTER</p>
<p>[Jill &amp; Terry Wilson recalled the last 13 years of the Burra Broadcaster.]</p>
<p>It is 13 years since we came to Burra. Burra had not then had a newspaper in the traditional sense since the closure of the Burra Record in 1977. It took some time for us to resurrect something that was more than a newsletter. The Burra Broadcaster grew out of change. When the somewhat uncomfortable merging of Councils occurred in 1997, the new identity forced some Burra locals to have a closer association with the other regions, especially to the south. In 2001 we saw the Eudunda and Robertstown communities were largely ignored by the press, despite the best efforts of their locals. We took the opportunity to broaden the paper for the whole Council region in a new-look tabloid-sized publication. In the middle of 2003 the Peterborough Times was included with the paper as a wraparound to the Broadcaster with its delivery late on Wednesday in that town. From next week with the new owners and management, news from the north and south will be included in the general news of the paper and circulated together. While we move on to another chapter of our lives, we are at ease leaving the business in the hands of the new owners.</p>
<p>We thank the community for their support in business and personally and we wish the new owners well.</p>
<p>We will remain as residents of Burra.</p>

<p>Goyder Council has made initial steps to developing an industrial estate for Burra by establishing a working party to come up with recommendations for Council to act upon – to report to Council in March. There is a need to balance heritage, residential, industrial and rural interests.</p>

<p>The Warren Bonython Memorial Walk will be held on 6 October along the Heysen Trail. Warren Bonython was a pioneer of the Heysen Trail and patron of the Friends of the Heysen Trail from 1986 till his death in April 2012. The trail runs 1,200 km from Cape Jervois to the Flinders Ranges. The idea is to have 1,200 walkers collectively traverse the 1,200 km walk in a single day. The trail will be divided into 60 sections of between 16 and 30 km in length. [Details of how to become involved are printed.]</p>

<p>The Oates Family of Poonunda.</p>
<p>The Oates family have been on Poonunda Station for almost 100 years and the current residents are John &amp; Jacqui Oates and their son Ryan, who is the fourth generation of the family to work on the property. They manage 18,000 ha as a sheep grazing property and have a small 100 ha holding at Mt Bryan to do a little cropping and to raise hay for their stock. The property currently supports a 6,000 to 7,000 Merino flock. The western edge of Poonunda is in the Burra Hills and it extends eastwards onto undulating flats. Rainfall is an unreliable 250 to 300 mm p.a. The property is watered by one permanent spring, 15 dams and 5 bores. Summer thunderstorms can cause floods. 75% of the pastures are bluebush and saltbush, with 25% grasslands, mostly on the hills. Surveys have found 12 to 14 species suited to stock feed and these are being evaluated to assist in determining when supplementary feeding is necessary. Long term management to maintain the property in good condition has included:</p>
<p>Ripping claypans to allow natural pasture regeneration.</p>
<p>Planting Oldman saltbush near the shearing shed to provide feed and protection to off shear sheep.</p>
<p>Buying extra land to better handle grazing pressure.</p>
<p>Managing kangaroos with permits to remove 2,000 p.a.</p>
<p>Fencing low lying flood prone areas and unproductive clay pans.</p>
<p>Droughts pose particular problems with 1995-2009 particularly difficult. Succession planning in those years has enabled Ryan to return to the property from a position in Kalgoorlie as a diesel mechanic. John is a founding member of the Burra Rangelands Action Group, which addresses such things as feral goats, rabbits, foxes and weeds. It involves 26 landowners in an area stretching from 50 or 60 km north to south and 20 to 30 km east to west.</p>
<p>The Riley Car Club currently has c. 70 vehicles touring the Burra District. They will continue to Pt Augusta on 7 August and from there will farewell 27 of the cars heading north on a ‘Rileys Through the Red Centre’ run – a south to north crossing of the continent.</p>

<p>Holder Memorial</p>
<p>Holder Garden in Chapel Street was the gathering place for about 40 guests for the official unveiling of interpretive panels outlining the significant achievements of the great nineteenth century Burra Resident, Sir Frederick Holder. Arranged by The Burra History Group, the unveiling was officiated by Sir Frederick’s great-grandson, Christopher Brooks. He stressed the Burra connection, since his great-grandfather had married in Burra and had eight children born here. The History Group President, Meredith Satchell was present and said Sir Frederick was a largely unsung hero of Burra. He came to Burra in 1875 as the headmaster of the Kooringa Public School and in a few years was manager of a store, Burra Town Clerk, managing editor of The Burra Record, an active member of the Burra Parliamentary Club, member of the Burra Gun Club, Mayor of Burra, Captain of the SA Volunteer Force and a Councillor of the SA School of Mines and Industry. He married a local girl, Julia Stephens and supported her in her temperance and anti-gambling campaigns. The couple had eight children. He was then elected to the SA Parliament as the local member, later becoming Treasurer and Premier, during which period he was a tireless proponent of Australian Federation. He moved into Federal Parliament and became the first Speaker in the Commonwealth Parliament, a position he held until his death in 1909.</p>

<p>Rural Clinical Education</p>
<p>A special community meeting on Monday evening explored the possibility of a new Flinders University Rural Clinical Education Centre for Burra. The Parallel Rural Community Curriculum (PRCC) Program offers rural placement for third year medical students, immersing them in rural general practice and rural community life. Students work closely with the local GPs, nursing staff and allied health professionals. Working in smaller hospitals develops a greater sense of responsibility and generally gives students more time with patient follow-up and with visiting specialists and consultants. The program also aims to get more Australian trained doctors into rural and regional areas. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station restoration project is nearing completion. It began in 2007 and in 2010 secured $200,000 funding from the state government, with smaller amounts added in 2013. Roy Taplin has been the volunteer project manager and has worked every week day for the last three and a half years, with some assistance from a small group of volunteers. Generous quotes from local tradesmen have made possible re-roofing, tiling, plumbing and electrical work. Roy has personally re-laid flooring and repaired woodwork and damaged walls. He has painted the interior and parts of the exterior. In 2013 he was nominated a SA Heritage Hero by the Premier Jay Weatherill. Genosee &amp; Wyoming Australia will transfer the lease of the station this month to the Department of Planning, Transport &amp; Infrastructure. The intended use of the building is for display space focusing on the natural history of the region prior to white settlement – a story not told elsewhere in the town. To assist in covering running and maintenance costs the eastern end has been converted to a residence, suitable for a Bed &amp; Breakfast venture and it is hoped the station will become a significant tourist attraction. Use of the space has been negotiated with various groups and it is hoped they will install movable displays to enable flexibility in the use of the building so space can be hired out to raise funds for upkeep, along with the B &amp; B.</p>

<p>Transforming Burra Creek. An action plan to transform the Burra Creek was launched on Monday night in the Burra Town Hall. Consultants EBS Ecology have developed a plan for the Burra Revegetation Group for the transformation of the Burra Creek between the Golf Course and the Cemetery. Over ten years the plan calls for 26,000 plants to be placed and for this year plants have been ordered along with tree guards and soil conditioner. As well as plants, the plan envisages walking and riding trails, picnic areas and interpretive signs. Rob Perry, as Chair of the Burra Revegetation Group, said the BRG was keen to have the input of ideas and comments from interested people. Funds for the plan were provided by the SA Murray Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board with support from the Goyder Council.</p>

<p>SA Premier Visits Burra</p>
<p>In a whirlwind two day visit to the Mid North last week, Premier Jay Weatherill visited Burra and spent time with members of local government, business owners and residents. He had an informal dinner with community members at the Burra Pizzeria, La Pecora Nera. On his way back from Peterborough on Thursday, he dropped in at the Burra Railway Station. In 2009 Mr Weatherill as Environment &amp; Conservation Minister announced the setting aside of $200,000 to kick-start the station restoration project. Almost five years on, the project has seen the station transformed, with most of the credit going to volunteer Roy Taplin, assisted by local tradesmen. Roy has been at work each day from 7.30 a.m. to 11 a.m. The Premier has been following the progress and last year paid a visit to the station, following his nomination of Roy in the Premier’s Heritage Heroes 2015 Award. He said Roy’s effort had effected an amazing transformation, which was a wonderful credit to Roy and also to all those involved in the restoration. [3 photos.]</p>

<p>Pig &amp; Whistle Site. The site of one of Burra’s earliest hotels, the Pig &amp; whistle, on the corner of Thames and George Streets, is part of a block being prepared for low income housing by Unity Housing Company. Progress was halted pending investigation by a team from Austral Archaeology to document the site. The hotel has no known photographic record or sketches. The team found layers of stonework, ash residue and a cobblestone floor of what is believed to be the hotel stable. Broken glass, bottles and lead bottle tops were recovered.</p>
<p>It is believed the hotel catered for miners who occupied surrounding cottages and that the front faced west onto Lower Thames Street. It opened in 1854, had eleven rooms in 1874, from Council records and an assembly room was added in 1876. The building was destroyed by fire in March 1883 and it was alleged the fire was caused by an arson attack. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Quilters were joined by a few Clare Quilters last Wednesday at the Bowling Club to stitch the Bedford Mystery Quilt. Several years ago Faye Packham, who has a disables daughter living in one of Bedford Independent Living Units, designed a quilt that could be sold in pre-packed form with the proceeds going to Bedford Industries. Four designs later, they have raised nearly $250,000 from the kits, as all fabrics have been donated by industry and individuals. This year 1,200 kits have been sent all over Australia.</p>

<p>The Wilkins 1 Launch</p>
<p>A test balloon was launched at c. 10.30 a.m. and tracked to a maximum altitude of 19,217 km [sic: for metres] and a temperature of -3oC and a location 72.6 km northeast of Burra. A glitch at launch resulted in a small clip becoming unattached and this removed the ability to determine where the payload would land. Wilkins 1 was launched at c. 11.30 a.m. It reached an altitude of 18,472 m, parachuted safely to earth and was successfully retrieved. [3 photos.]</p>

<p>Burra Country Music Festival &amp; Yacht Race.</p>
<p>Plans are underway, but much has yet to be done to complete the steps to revive the event. It has been decided to make the yacht race the Peter Reilly Memorial Race.</p>
<p>The History of the Burra Yacht Club</p>
<p>In the winter of 1980 Burra experienced some severe flooding, which resulted in several feet of fast flowing muddy water passing over the Bon Accord ford</p>
<p>After a hard day’s work north of Burra, Jimmy (Tracker) James couldn’t wait to get to the Bon Accord to sample some of its fine ale and made a calculated decision to cross the ford in his car.</p>
<p>The water was deeper than anticipated and the car stalled mid-way.</p>
<p>Peter Reilly noted Tracker’s desperate plight and effected a resue.</p>
<p>After many an ale at the Bon Accord, Peter and Tracker got into a discussion about which of them could sail the farthest down Burra Creek.</p>
<p>The only way to settle it was to try it out.</p>
<p>On the appointed day the pair arrived at the present site of the regatta, armed with stubbies and their respective craft and the race was run in accordance with a suitable lack of rules.</p>
<p>Nobody knows who won this inaugural event, as neither craft completed the course, but all and sundry thought it a great idea and plans were laid to make it an annual event.</p>
<p>A club was formed and in 1981 the first full scale Burra Yacht Club Regatta was held.</p>
<p>In the 1st Regatta the ‘Open Cutter’ of Burra won, but was challenged in 1982 by the ‘Mallala Special’.</p>
<p>For his role in the foundation of the club Tracker James was made permanent Commodore of the Club and Peter Reilly was appointed Chairman and was presented with the ‘Order of the Burra Yacht Club’ for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p>In honour of his devotion to the club the main event of 2014 will be known as the Peter Reilly Memorial Race.</p>

<p>The Burra Jinker – a reprint of an article by R.J. (Bob Noye) (16 July 1932 to 17 August 2002.)</p>
<p>The transporting of Schneider’s pumping engine to the Burra Mine was a great achievement for a colony less than 20 years old. The engine arrived at Pt Adelaide on the Joseph Weir in April 1851 and was loaded onto the jimker that had been especially built in Adelaide. The Cornish boilers were brought to the mine in sections and erected on the spot. Bullock driver Bell Freeman was given the task of transporting the cylinder, which had a bore of almost seven feet and weighed 8 tons. He started in January 1852 with a team of 72 bullocks – six abreast at the face of the jinker, ten in the next rank and then gradually decreasing to the leading pair. The few bridges on the way were shored up to prevent damage and covered with a layer of sand to reduce vibration. The bullocks were unhitched and taken across the bridge and then reassembled the other side. The jinker was then hauled across with ropes.</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station Celebration Dinner</p>
<p>The dinner held on Saturday 9 August was very successful. It was a fundraiser to furnish the proposed Bed &amp; Breakfast at the station, as well as to celebrate the completion of the restoration. The former refreshment room was filled to capacity. Pip Edson, on behalf of Friends of the Burra Railway Station made an eloquent speech of thanks to all who have assisted and especially to Roy Taplin, without whose huge effort the project could not have succeeded. Among the guests was Peter Hasse and his mother Isabel (formerly Bampton) who were residents in the 1950s and 60s, when Isabel’s late husband, Jim, was a porter at the station for about 13 years. Peter kindly donated some of his father’s mementos. Also present from Murray Bridge was Denis Smith, who has produced a 26-page A4 pictorial book on the Burra Station – available from Burra Visitor Centre, the Town Hall and the Burra Station.

<p>Burra Regional Art gallery retiring Chair Elaine Gardner spoke on Radio North and West’s morning program about the financial problems facing Burra and many other galleries as people buy few works of art these days. A proposal is being developed to assist them by means of more small financial contributions from local and state governments as well as private donors. Burra Gallery raises money from selling cards, running raffles and competitions and selling smaller items as a shop, as well as some catering functions. Given more volunteers, they would like to extend into showing more young people’s work and running youth workshops.</p>

<p>Letter. Rev Darren Lovell, Uniting Church Minister for Burra and Mannum, writes a letter to Minister Rankine on the current debate over School Chaplaincy. He says as a qualified social worker (BaSW) he can positively state that School chaplaincy works better than secular welfare type programs. He had seen that again and again. The Minister should not let ideological views take precedence over the welfare of the community.</p>

<p>Burra Golf Club Centenary</p>
<p>Over the October long weekend the club celebrates the centenary of its affiliation with the SA Golf Association. A golf club was first formed in Burra in 1899 and the Burra Record reported the links had been laid out over 13⁄4 miles from Brewery Flat around the old smelting works. Presumably it would have started and finished near the current site of the Caravan Park.</p>
<p>In 1913 it was reported to have been re-formed at a meeting chaired by Dr Steele, who was elected President, a position he held until 1942, except for his period of service in WWI. In 1934 it was decided to erect a clubhouse and to incorporate the club. The ladies decided to form their own club. In May 1934 the Town Council gave permission to erect a galvanised iron structure on the Burra Sports Syndicate Ground at Aberdeen, for an estimated cost of £60.</p>
<p>In 1938 a motion was passed thanking Elder Smith &amp; Co. and Mr E. Ford for the use of property – presumably for use of land ‘across the road’ on which part of the course lay and which was private property until 1972. In 1954 the course had 14 holes and it was then proposed to extend it to 18. At the 1969 AGM it was moved that permission be sought to plant small trees between fairways, though in March 1970 planting was deferred, pending ascertaining the cost of watering.</p>
<p>In September 1972 Crafter Bros. were engaged to redesign the course for $500, the work being carried out by volunteers and the new course was opened on 29 April 1973. In 1973 tree planting began in earnest – some trees were planted by primary school children as part of their Conservation Day activities. In June 1973 a subcommittee investigated the design and cost of a new clubhouse, which was finally opened 28 September 1975. The next major project was to convert the course from a winter scrapes course to an all year round greens course. A proposal was submitted to the Burra Burra DC in 1997. The Council agreed to provide a loan of $175,000 over ten years and a grant of $10,000 per year for five years to assist in establishment costs and initial loan repayments. As a result of irrigating the course the trees have grown dramatically.</p>
<p>In 2014 Goyder Council was approached to upgrade and refurbish the clubhouse. Council provided a grant of $25,000, with the total spend expected to be c. $30,000. A verandah has been erected on the north side of the clubhouse, carpet, furniture and interior lights replaced and the building painted inside and out by voluntary labour.</p>

<p>The Burra Show</p>
<p>There were record breaking pavilion entries and the return of farm machinery to help the 2014 show to its success. There was a new look lay-out that added to the carnival atmosphere. The crowd looked to be about the same size as in 2013, but actual figures are not yet available. The weather was perfect. School entries were outstanding. Events like the Ute Muster, the Famers’ Challenge and Show Jumping Dogs provided something for everyone. Ramsey Bros. brought machinery from Riverton, making it the first time I more than 20 years that there was machinery on show. There were many more horses and the poultry and pigeons filled their shed with about 600 entries. Shearing entries were slightly down, but competition was fierce. Local, Wayne O’Brien took out the Open Championship.</p>
<p>Mr Jock Duncan officially opened the show. Life Memberships were awarded to Helen Stockman and Geraldine Smedley, while a posthumous Life Membership, awarded to Peter Reilly, was presented to Matt and James Reilly.</p>
<p>The Young Farmers’ Challenge was a great spectacle and provided much fun. The winning team, Baldina Bale Busters, comprised Kobey Morris, Chris Rains, Marcus Fitzgerald and Brayden Hutchcraft. Vanessa Thomas won Champion Ute, Best Presented and Best street Ute. Barry Hool and daughter Wendy Meaney of Burra won Best Classic Ute. [10 photos.]</p>

<p>An Ultralight Aircraft crashed at Burra Golf Club last Tuesday morning. The pilot was a 54-year-old man from Gympie and formerly of Burra.

The couple were on the first leg of a trip around Australia and were in Burra to visit a brother and brother-in-law, Tony Gisi and family. [2 photos.]</p>

<p>Burra Red Cross Centenary</p>
<p>A small crowd witnessed the unveiling of a commemorative plaque in the Burra Red Cross Centenary Rose Garden on Tuesday 21 September by Hon. Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP. Burra Red Cross President, Pat Kakoschke welcomed those present and recounted a brief history of the branch. There were only seven Red Cross branches in SA that will turn 100 this year, with 100 years of continuous service. The first Australian branch of Red Cross was instigated by the wife of the Governor General, Lady Helen Munro-Ferguson, in Melbourne on 13 August 1914 – war having been declared on the 4th. Within two to three weeks a number of branches had been established across SA, including the one in Burra. Red Cross quickly got health services to the front, including hospital equipment, often moving more quickly than the government bureaucracy. The role of the Red Cross continues today – for example in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. [3 photos.]</p>

<p>Aleppo Pines</p>
<p>The Aloppo Pine (Pinus halepensis) was introduced in the 1800s and has become a rapidly spreading weed. It is a declared species under the Natural Resources Management Act. It is invasive and forms a mat of needles that inhibits the germination of native species. It has spread particularly on roadsides and disturbed sites or where overgrazing has reduced native vegetation. Larger pines can be killed by ringbarking and younger ones hand pulled or cut off below the level of green needles. Burra’s Clean Up Australia Day Sunday will work on reducing these pines around Burra.</p>

<p>Letter from Juanita Queissner of Burra on her personal memories of an Aleppo Pine and referring to an article in the National Geographic Magazine of 2011 re the introduction of the pine into Australia by Lance Corporal Benjamin Smith and Sergeant McDowell in 1915 – survivors of WWI and quoting from the article: ‘Regardless of what species the Lone Pine was, its symbolic importance as a representation of our nation’s tenacity and fortitude remains. LEST WE FORGET.’</p>

<p>Letter. Peter Brodie writes re the suspension of the local doctor from accident and emergency cases at the Burra Hospital.</p>
<p>He was told he would never find out who were the eight doctors on whose authority the doctor was suspended.</p>
<p>He now has the names of the six people on the panel and some are not independent GPs.</p>
<p>Someone must have instigated this event that cost a huge amount before the department admitted they were wrong.</p>
<p>A great deal of damage was done to both the doctor’s and the hospital’s reputation and still more rumours persist.</p>

<p>Aleppo Pines – Comments posted on Burra Broadcaster Website</p>
<p>Maureen</p>
<p>The effort is unlikely to eliminate the source of Christmas trees or of shady trees in the town. The mine site has been identified as an important grassland site as it has not been grazed to any degree and as the location of some rare and endangered plants, it deserves protection.</p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>The mine site has not been grassland for more than 150 years and will not support any plant native to this region. The Aleppo has a valuable cultural heritage and tourists’ experience will be heightened when viewing a mine site framed by the trunks of mature trees. They will also appreciate the shade.</p>
<p>Lisa</p>
<p>Aleppo pines seem to grow in places where not a blade of grass, native or introduced will dare. The Aleppo grows and softens the town landscapes and, while I am all for preserving our history, I trust common sense prevails and a balance between green (of any sort) and history will be reached.</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>Any species that becomes invasive should be controlled – not necessarily eliminated, but controlled. Native plants and grasses should be encouraged and this is almost impossible if tree growth becomes too large in numbers.</p>

<p>Letter from Andrew Clough</p>
<p>Obituary. Andrew’s mother, Rosemary Clough nee Pearse, originally from the Burra District, died 3 March 2015 aged 82. She was born at ‘The Gums’, which was then of c. 74,000 acres and was run in conjunction with ‘Glenbower’ of c. 17,000 acres. She was born 15 November 1932 in Burra, the daughter of Norman Hiles Pearse and Edna Langshore Pearse, nee Killicoat (born in Burra). Edna was a descendant of Isaac Killicoat, Captain of the Burra Smelting Works, who later resided at Abberton Park. Rosemary’s family moved from Burra to Adelaide c. 1941. Rosemary went to Wilderness School and then to a business college and spent most of her working life in secretarial and personal assistant roles – beginning at F.H. Faulding and later at Dalgety. She married Graham Clough in 1965 and Andrew was born in 1966. Rosemary’s final position was with Anglican Community Services (now Anglicare) for many years before retiring in 1993. She was involved with the St John Ambulance, Victims of Crime and with Probus. In 2011 she was diagnosed with dementia and went to live at Helping Hand, North Adelaide. He funeral service was at St Peter’s Cathedral on 17 March 2015.</p>

<p>Burra Hospital</p>
<p>Nursing staff at Burra Hospital are rallying to stop the proposed changes that would replace Nursing Staff with Care Workers at the Hospital. This would affect the availability of acute and emergency care. The Hospital at present provides services in aged and acute care, but Care Workers would restrict that to Aged care, thus significantly affecting the availability of health services in the community. On Monday evening a small group met Mr Weatherill at La Pecora Nera and said later they were glad to have been heard. He asked why the Burra Hospital was different from others and the nurses explained that many hospitals have separate Aged Care, but ours is mixed in with Acute and Emergency Care and Care Workers cannot care for Acute and Emergency patients. The next move is to get the public aware of the threat and to have them contact the Minister for health and the local MP, expressing their concern. [Photo.]</p>

Presently there is no resident doctor and no accident and emergency service – how long before no hospital? He was promised answers.</p>

<p>Burra Railway Station Re-opened</p>
<p>Mr Jay Weatherill, Premier of SA re-opened the restored Burra Railway Station on Tuesday 31 March, following five years of hard work. The event coincided with a luncheon organised by the State Government as part of their Country Cabinet event.</p>
<p>The station was erected in 1883 to replace the original wooden structure of 1870. Passenger services were discontinued 13 December 1986 and the last grain trains ran in January 1999. The last passenger train was an Australian Railways Historical Society special steam train on 19 September 1992. The last movement on the line was a light engine on 12 March 2004. The line beyond Burra was taken up in 1992-93.</p>
<p>In February 1999 Goyder Council applied for State Heritage Branch funding for urgent repairs to the building, which was vested in the Minister for Transport and Urban Planning after services ceased and then leased out.</p>
<p>By 2009 Pip Edson had begun the arduous process of writing to the State Government for funding. In 2006 Peter Harvey and Roger Cross had secured the lease through the Burra Regional Art Gallery. In March 2010 Pip’s efforts bore fruit when the Government announced a $200,000 grant to begin conservation and restoration work.</p>
<p>Roy Taplin and his wife Brenda had come to Burra in 2004. Roy was a retired master painter and decorator and he became involved in the restoration. The building had been vandalised and was inhabited by pigeons. It was also badly damaged by termites and salt damp. Roy worked every morning for years on repairs and restoration, replacing floors, repairing ceilings, restoring woodwork and making cupboards from salvaged flooring, as well as painting the interior and parts of the exterior. He also managed the whole project, which involved local tradesmen.</p>
<p>By History Month May 2011 the building was safe enough for part of it to be opened to visitors and by May 2014 the major work had been completed and the station has been open to visitors from 11 a/m/ to 1 p.m., with a guide from ‘Friends of the Burra Railway Station’ in attendance. It was decided that to generate funds for the ongoing maintenance of the building bed and breakfast accommodation would be established at the eastern end of the building. It is intended that the building will house displays and will be available for special events and several weddings and parties have already made use of it.</p>
<p>A plaque marking the re-opening was unveiled by the Premier in recognition of the work done by Roy Taplin and Burra community volunteers.</p>

<p>Burra Regional Art Gallery. On Sunday 26 April Donald Richardson, artist and educator will give an illustrated talk on Australian War Memorials. He has just completed a book on the subject The Digger Image.</p>
<p>The Burra War Memorial is a remarkable 12 m high granite column surmounted by a 2.4 m bronze figure of a digger in the ‘parry’ position. It was modelled by a Mr Willmett, an Adelaide fibrous plaster manufacturer, about whom nothing more is known. It was cast by the Adelaide firm of A.W. Dobbie, cost the large sum of c. £3,500 and was unveiled by Prime Minister W.M. Hughes in 1922. The Burra Record 10 March 1920 said the organising committee did not want a ‘stiff expressionless figure’ i.e. an imported marble figure [like so many others’].</p>

<p>Police Community Forum. About sixty residents attended the forum in Burra Town Hall last Wednesday evening. It was organised to introduce the two new police officers to the town; Michael Lymberopolous and Sam Parish and was addressed by Superintendent Scott Denny, the Yorke &amp; Mid North Commander. Both the new officers attended school at Clare and are no strangers to rural life. Various policing issues were raised. The question of the drug ‘ice’ was raised and Superintendent Denny said it was around locally, but was not particularly prevalent. One of the biggest issues in the Yorke Peninsula and Mid North area was the poaching of livestock.</p>

<p>Burra Show. Last week’s committee meeting decided the show would go into recess for 2015. This follows difficulty in finding a person to undertake the vital position of secretary. It is now too late to induct a person into the many tasks this role involves. The society has been going on with a small committee and with little success in adding to it over recent years. Last week five new members were welcomed and these young members have agreed to start planning for the 2016 show, with new ideas and tasks. It is expected that the show will return in 2016, equal or better than in 2014.</p>

<p>The 2015 SA Hiking Challenge saw about 300 tutu-clad hikers on the Heysen Trail to raise funds for the Jodi Lee Foundation – to raise awareness for the prevention of bowel cancer. Participants were in and around Burra for three days and the hikers celebrated with a special dinner at the Burra Mine at the conclusion of the event. $376,840 was raised.</p>
<p>The foundation honours 39-year-old Jodi Lee, who died from bowel cancer in 2010 and it was established by her husband, Nick. Jodi loved a little black dress and since her death Little Black Dress Parties have been held in many cities and they gave rise to the black tutus worn by the hikers.</p>

<p>Willalo Hall and School</p>
<p>The Willalo Hall was constructed c. 1918* and served the local community for many decades, but as a result of lack of use and maintenance, it has fallen into disrepair. A general meeting of the Willalo Hall Committee on 8 March 2000 resolved to ask Council to put the Hall up for tender for demolition and that the land be not sold, but be reserved for community use and a plaque and trees be placed on the site. In January 2007 the former Secretary of Willalo Hall and Oval Committee advised of the winding up of the committee and requested Council maintain the Hall until it was demolished. An inspection in 2015 determined it was a risk to public safety and should be demolished. Renovations were not financially viable.</p>
<p>[*See the article Issue 37, 22 July 2015, page 6, which says it was built in 1912. A Trove search shows it was actively being used through 1913.]</p>

<p>Joyce has built a reputation as a star flower arranger in the Mid North. As a young mother, she was bed-ridden with a debilitating back problem and her husband would bring in flowers she had planted in a wash trough and she would turn them into posies. This led to flower arranging for her church and then to arrangements for weddings. Joyce travelled to Adelaide for some tuition at the Floral Society. She has exhibited at the Burra Show on many occasions and given many talks around the Mid North. Her arrangements have graced many Burra events over many years. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra’s Old Jinker has become the first movable object to be provisionally entered in the SA Heritage Register.</p>
<p>The jinker was constructed in 1851. It is 40 feet long and was made by Mr Coulls of Hindley Street, Adelaide and built of iron bark timber. It was first used in 1852 by bullocky Bell Freeman to transport pumping machinery for Schneider’s Enginehouse, which was to replace the previously installed Roach’s 60 inch diameter pumping engine. The 17 ton engine was drawn by 72 bullocks. In 1858 leading bullock driver William Woollacott again used the jinker to transport the engine for Morphett’s Enginehouse. The return trip took two months. It was sent to Adelaide in 1936 for an exhibition and only returned to Burra in 1962. It is now housed in a specially constructed shelter in Market Street.</p>

<p>The 2015 Burra AGL Country Music Festival.</p>
<p>Held over the weekend of 6-8 November, this event was a resounding success and the outstanding weather helped to boost numbers significantly, with an average attendance of c. 1,500 over the three-day event. More local faces were in the crowd this year. The opening show on Friday departed from the traditional country music theme, to concentrate on rock and roll hits from the 60s and 70s, with the ‘Party Cats’. This had the audience dancing most of the night, led by the Renmark Rock ʼn’ Roll Dancers. The band included Peter Tilbrook (lead guitarist), from the ‘Master’s Apprentices’ and John Bywaters (bass guitarist) from ‘The Twighlights’, both from highly acclaimed rock bands of the era.</p>
<p>Saturday night’s program was more traditional country music. Tracey Rains and Claypan Band were part of a high class line-up that included Paul Costa and Aleyce Simmonds, Dwayne Elix, Gina Timms and Bill Gray, with local South Australian stars, Nathaniel O’Brien, Megan Laurie, Tanya Cornish, Shane Johnson and Juliet Oliver. A surprise act on Saturday night was the Burra Village People – John Turner, Chris Rains, Trevor Keilar, Michael Jones, Dwayne Elix and Shane Johnson.</p>
<p>The festival brought many visitors and boosted local businesses. Overall the event was an outstanding success. Sadly the festival came to an early end on Sunday afternoon, when news was received that 19-year-old Burra singer Nathaniel O’Brien had been killed in a car accident while travelling to Adelaide, after completing has Sunday morning Gospel Music session. Audience members observed a one minute silence before departing the showground.</p>

<p>The Mawson Iron Project &amp; Razorback Magnetite Deposit northeast of Burra is attracting overseas interest. If financial backing could be obtained, production could follow in four to five years. Magnetite Mines General Manager, Dr Gavin England says they are trying to interest Chinese investors. The mine would be located east of Peterborough and southeast of Yunta, with the ore transported to a floating port at Wallaroo, via a pipeline carrying it as slurry. Mawson Iron Province is considered to be the largest undeveloped magnetite province in the world. [Map] Once developed the deposit would have a life of 20 to 25 years, producing at first 25 million tonnes p.a. and rising to 100 million tonnes p.a. The concept plan envisages an administrative centre at Burra, probably with workers flying in and out daily by helicopter from Burra, rather than a conventional fly-in fly-out scheme. The pipeline would pass just south of Burra and the state government would be asked to assist with infrastructure in Burra in terms of adequate power, roads, sewerage and water. 450 people would be required for the first stage.</p>

<p>The Burra History Group has recreated the Burra Cheer-Up Hall from WWI in the Mary Warnes Room at the Burra Town Hall. The Burra branch of the Cheer-Up Society was the first country branch formed in May 1915. Its main object was to see that no local volunteer left without a farewell social and a small gift. Later they tried to ensure that none returned without a welcome at the station and a social in the Cheer-Up Hall. Members also made socks, handkerchiefs, etc. for the front line and despatched special gifts for Christmas. The group also supported the town’s other patriotic efforts. Most of the 300 members were women, but there was also a small group of male members. When the local brass band failed, due to enlistment in the war effort, the branch formed the Burra Cheer-Up Ladies’ Band. This became famous throughout SA and visited a number of Country towns and Adelaide. It was dissolved on the men’s return. The Cheer-Up Society presented returned personnel with a medal at the Burra Institute on 29 October 1919. [3 photos.]</p>

<p>New Walking Trail</p>
<p>On Sunday 17 April the Heysen &amp; Lavender Federation Trails will join at Web Gap. The celebration will be at nearby ‘Peppermint Springs’. The Heysen Trail is SA’s best known walking trail. It got off to a slow start after it was suggested by Warren Bonython in 1969 and by 1978 only 7 km had been constructed. Then Terry Lavender built the 50 km section from Mt Magnificent to Mt Lofty in three months. He became the main designer for the track, overseeing construction till its completion in 1992. Terry was made an OAM in 1994. In 1998 he got the idea of a walking trail from Murray Bridge along the eastern side of the ranges and then west to Clare – to be called the Federation Trail. It was renamed the Lavender Federation Trail in 2004. Over the next two years the trail will be extended from Webb Gap to Clare to link with the Riesling and Rattler Trails. Another planned trail is the Murray Coorong Trail, following the Murray from Salt Creek on the Coorong to Cadell.</p>

<p>Roy Taplin, Burra’s Restoration Hero, is leaving the town. Roy and his wife Brenda came to Burra in retirement in 2003. Having established a home and garden, Roy offered himself as a volunteer to restore the interior of the Burra Town Hall. As a master painter and decorator, Roy undertook major repairs as well as the beautiful redecorating work that transformed the building. Roy then turned his attention to the Burra Railway Station. Here Roy managed the huge restoration work, the majority of it single-handed. The project was kicked off with a $200,000 government grant, which eventually grew to about $300,000. Estimates for the restoration were $1 million. Without Roy’s years of dedicated time and skill, the project could not have been completed. Roy has given a magnificent gift to the town. We wish Roy and Brenda contentment in their move to the city.</p>

<p>John Brak has tendered his resignation as Goyder Council CEO, effective from 31 December 2016. Mayor Mattey said he and the Council had received the news with regret. John Brak said it was a personal decision, made more difficult because he headed a group of motivated employees, had a good working relationship with the Mayor and Councillors and the Council was financially sustainable. He said however, the excitement of the job had waned and maintaining motivation to lead the organisation to greater heights had become a struggle. [Photo.]</p>

<p>Burra Show</p>
<p>The weather for the show was excellent, following a month of unpredictable conditions that included cyclones and floods. There were trade sites, rides, the ute show, tractor display, food stalls and plenty of competitions. The pavilion was full of entries and the scarecrow competition on the hill was an interesting innovation. Many returned for the evening entertainment with its amazing fireworks display.

<p>Burra Penguin Club celebrates the 50th anniversary of their inaugural meeting held on 23 September 1966, when 27 interested women met in Burra Town Hall. Mary Woollacott was present on both occasions and gave an interesting address connecting the many shared experiences of members over the 50 years. Other speakers also drew on their memories. Mary Woollacott had the honour of cutting the birthday cake. [2 photos.]</p>

<p>Open Gardens</p>
<p>The event was greatly affected by the preceding storms, but three gardens were open in Burra and two out of town: Brooke Stockman’s on the Farrell Flat Road on both days and Felicity Martin’s in Hallett on Sunday.</p>
<p>The guest speaker could not get through and organisers apologised to stall holders – some of whom were able to sell their goods locally. Thanks to the Show Committee the scarecrow competition was still held at the show, where Dan van Holst Pellekaan MP was the judge. Open section winner was Pip Edson and the school section winner was Nick Haddow.</p>

<p>Accident. On Thursday evening 29 October a vehicle failed to take the corner at the intersection of Kooringa Road and the Goyder Highway. The vehicle rolled some distance down a steep slope and ended in a small water-filled dam. The driver was treated at Burra Hospital for mild concussion. The vehicle could not be retrieved until Saturday.</p>

<p>The Super Storm that affected the rest of SA so severely on 28-29 September also hit Burra, but not so severely as many other places, where cyclonic winds destroyed all in their path. Winds in Burra damaged sheds and fences and brought down trees all over the place. The loss of power left many without heating and also brought the loss of mobile phone coverage. Power losses in some cases extended for days. The town was cut off by flood waters and road damage for some time. Some local rainfall reports:</p>

<p>Burra Broadcaster – FINAL ISSUE</p>
<p>Due to financial constraints this will be the final edition of the Burra Broadcaster. News from Burra &amp; Districts will be covered through the Plains Producer – a larger paper with a larger distribution, as of next week.</p>
<p>The Burra Broadcaster commenced publication after the closure of The Mid North Broadcaster in June 2013. The introduction of the online news service <a href="https://www.burrabroadcaster.com.au">www.burrabroadcaster.com.au</a> in August 2014 [sic: for 2013] was followed by the publication of the first hard copy using a home printer and later supported by the Burra Community Library. The paper took a more professional appearance after gaining sponsorship from AGL, allowing for better quality photos and colour on the front and back cover pages.</p>

<p>Burra Picnic Races were held on 22 October and drew a crowd of c. 1,200. The racing was enjoyed by all and the novelty events like the sack races, the wheelbarrow race, the hogget race and the sleepy lizard derby, all provided great fun. The day ended with a party with music from the local band ‘Ramshackles’ from 6 to 9 p.m., followed by the other band, ‘Mamboobies’ to continue the dancing. Money from the event will aid RFDS and other community groups. Local clubs and charities with stall did well on the day.</p>

<p>Burra’s Heritage Listed Paxton Square Cottages built in 1849, are to be upgraded and modernised, with the support of a $200,000 State Government Regional Development Fund Grant.</p>
<p>The whole $1.2 million project undertaken by the Goyder Council will underpin the Paxton Square Cottages as a boutique and contemporary accommodation complex. The 32 cottage complex will be repurposed to a 3.5 star rated facility. The Bible Christian Chapel will be adapted to a communal meeting place for guests. The upgrade and rebranding will support greater tourism in the area and will provide a modern comfortable offering for tourists to the Clare valley tourism region. It will support Burra’s initiative to become the ‘home of the boutique festival’. The aim will also be to boost occupancy in the non-traditional tourism periods in Burra.</p>

<p>History of the Burra Record by Ian Auhl</p>
<p>Supplied by the Burra History Group</p>
<p>• The paper began on 30 June 1876 as The Northern Mail [The premises was on part allotment 72 Commercial Street, in 2017 this is the property opposite the roadhouse]</p>
<p>• Six months later it changed its name to The Burra News and Northern Mail.</p>
<p>• In July 1878 its new editor. Frederick William Holder announced its new title would be The Record.</p>
<p>• On 4 October 1878 the name changed again to The Burra Record.</p>
<p>• It had taken a long time for Burra to get a local paper. Compare its starting date with The Kapunda Herald (1864). The Kadina &amp; Wallaroo Times (1865) and The Northern Argus (Clare. 1869).</p>
<p>• Burra had to make do with printed handbills for advertising and a town crier.</p>
<p>• The cost originally of 3d made it too expensive for many and kept its circulation low; 600 by the end of 1876.</p>
<p>• In October 1878 Holder became the sole proprietor.</p>
<p>• Under Holder the paper flourished. He became Mayor of Burra in 1886 and again in 1888, having been elected to Parliament in 1887. He was later Premier of SA on two occasions.</p>
<p>• In September 1880 Holder announced they would move next door because the original office (in Commercial Street) was about to be demolished to make room for two new shops to be built for Messrs Drew &amp; Co.</p>
<p>• Three years later on 6 January 1883 four shops on Market Square were destroyed by fire: Lane&rsquo;s Saddlery, Geake&rsquo;s store, Packard&rsquo;s Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. Doe&rsquo;s Hairdressing Salon and the Burra Record Office.</p>
<p>• Despite the complete destruction The Burra Record appeared later that week, having been printed in Adelaide.</p>
<p>The shops were rapidly rebuilt.</p>
<p>• Late in 1883 the paper was issued twice a week and the price fell to 2d.</p>
<p>• In 1890 Holder sold the paper to Mr P. Murrie Jnr.</p>
<p>• In January 1891 the paper reverted to being a weekly.</p>
<p>• In September 1891 W.J. Davey took over as editor. [And later became the proprietor.]</p>
<p>• Davey reduced the size of the paper and in 1904 increased the pages to 8.</p>
<p>• Davey sold out to Ernest Frederick Marston in March 1913.</p>
<p>• In 1945 E.F. Marston sold the paper to his son Frank Teare Marston.</p>
<p>• In 1942 the paper was reduced to four pages, but increased again to 8 from 1945.</p>
<p>• E.L. &amp; R.F. Angel acquired the paper in June 1954. The Marstons had printed the paper for 41 years.</p>
<p>• Eric Angel must be the person with the longest association with the paper. He came to Burra from Eudunda in 1929 and was employed by Mr Marston Sen., and then by his son before taking it over in 1954 with his son, Bob until 1977.</p>
<p>[• The Burra Record ceased publication on 8 March 1977 as an independent entity. From that date Burra news has appeared in The Northern Argus and in a series of other publications as listed below.]</p>
<p>• 1977 - 1987 Burra news appeared in the The Review Times Record.</p>
<p>• 1978 - 1993 Burra Community School and Community News.</p>
<p>• 1991 2006 Terry Wilson editor and proprietor of the Burra Broadcaster.</p>
<p>• 2006 The Taylor Group of Newspapers purchased the Burra Broadcaster and incorporated The Eudunda Observer</p>
<p>and The Peterborough Times into The Mid North Broadcaster.</p>
<p>• June 2013 the Mid North Broadcaster ceased operation.</p>
<p>• July August 2013 former Mid North Broadcaster journalist Michelle Osborn established an online Burra Broadcaster news service.</p>
<p>[• Michelle Osborn’s incarnation of the Burra Broadcaster first appeared in a hard copy format with the December issue 2013 (unnumbered) and ended with Issue 66.]</p>
<p>[Note. Ian Auhl did the research for the history of The Burra Record. Subsequent to that the information comes from The Burra History Group.</p>
<p>The sites occupied by the Burra Record and its predecessors are very difficult, if not impossible to pin down. The business appears to have begun on allotment 72 in 1876. (In 2017 this was opposite the Mobil Roadhouse). In 1878 there was a move to the site adjacent to the Visitor Information Centre of 2017 on part allotment 79 – where the chemist shop was located in 2017. Its next move is hard to fathom. In 1880 it was said to move next door in June and in September into one of the new shops built immediately north. A fire destroyed this group of four shops in 1883, but they were quickly rebuilt and the paper seems to have moved back into its site. In 1897 the premises of the paper were bought by Walkers, who incorporated it into their large shop and the paper moved two doors north. We have not precisely dated the next and final move, which saw the paper occupy the two shops immediately east of Pascoe’s (the two storey building on Commercial Street), but Council assessment records place E.F. Marston on part allotment 70 in 1922.]</p>
