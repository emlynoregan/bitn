Burra Show Society is planning a number of additional displays because this year’s show will be the 100th* staged by the society.  At the AGM last week Mr Ron Shipard was elected President. Following the resignation of Mr Daniel Field as Secretary the position was filled at special meeting on the Monday following and Mrs Bob Jamieson is the new secretary.

[*This is wildly inaccurate. The first Show was held in 1877, but there were no shows from 1886 to 1893, apparently due to apathy, which provoked considerable comment in the local paper at the time.  The 1897 Show was cancelled due to the appallingly bad season and the 1914 Show was cancelled due to the combined effects of the outbreak of World War I and a devastating drought.  (The event returned in 1915.)  Twenty-five years of Shows from 1915-39 ended in 1940 when the Show was cancelled due to World War II.  The Show remained suspended until 1946, since when it has been an annual event. This makes the 1977 show the 85th.]

Booborowie Centenary will be celebrated on 30 April and 1 May to coincide with the proclamation of the town on 29 March 1877.  Development of the district went back to 1843 when two brothers, M.J. & J.H. Browne, both doctors, played an important part in opening up the Northern Flinders Ranges.  It is believed that in the early days much of the Booborowie land was swampy, but pumping and farming has changed the nature of the land.  There will be a back-to-school and roll call of the South and North Booborowie Schools at 2.30 p.m. and tea in the Hall at 5 p.m.  On Sunday there will be a combined church service in the Hall and the unveiling of a commemorative plaque, followed by a barbecue at the oval.

Burra show Society.  In his annual report President Ron Shipard said the main improvement this year had been the extension of the show ring.  He thanked the District Council and Roocke Bros. [sic: Roche Bros?] for their assistance.  The last show had been a great success, but a misunderstanding about admission prices had cost them about $400 on the day.

Booborowie History

Booborowie was first opened for pastoral settlement in 1843, but not until 1846 did two brothers William J. & John H. Browne apply for an occupation licence.  Later in 1848 a further licence was applied for the area north of the Broughton adjoining the run granted to Messrs Browne in 1847 to the westward.  These two areas are now Booborowie.  The name is an Aboriginal word for round water hole.  The head station was located on Section 1000 and consists of an area of around 80 acres.  It was purchased at auction by James Brown for £80.  In 1851 waste lands of the Crown leases were issued in lieu of occupation licences and lease 130 (Booborowie) was granted to William and John Browne.  This originally comprised 153 square miles.  Two square miles were added in 1860 and on 17 December 1863 the Hundred of Ayers was proclaimed, within which Booborowie is located.  It was subdivided into sections and land was first offered for sale in 1864.  Most sites were bought by the Browne Brothers.  The south portion was re-subdivided and sold by Arthur Scott Browne of Buckland Filleigh Co. Devon England in c. 1910.  The northern part was sold by Percival John Browne and Arthur Scott Browne as executors of W.J. Browne who died in 1894.  It was bought in 1897 by Henry Dutton of Anlaby and George Melrose of Ulooloo.  In 1910 the land was offered for sale by Messrs Dutton and Melrose to the Government.  The offer was accepted and the land subdivided as North Booborowie Estate and sold under close settlement agreements.

The township was proclaimed 29 March 1877 and surveyed in the same year by W.H. Cornish.  The first building was the Methodist Church erected in 1891 at a cost of £194.  It was leased by the Government for use as a school for 27 years.  A prosperous town developed as the climate and soil favoured sheep and cattle.

A.L. Clode’s official opening will be next Friday.  A short ceremony will be held at 2.30 when the DC Chairman Mr Ray Jennison will declare the new complex open.  Clode’s have a long association with Burra.  Late in 1929 Eric Clode’s father, Mr Arthur (Laurie) Clode, decided to open a hardware shop to compliment his building business.  At that time the emphasis was on general building materials.  In 1949 Eric joined as an apprentice carpenter, a trade he continued until 1959 when he began to spend more time in the shop.  He saw the opportunity for a larger shopping complex and purchased the site for the new premises.  Work began on the new premises last June and it is designed to be a one stop shop for the handyman. As well as hardware there is a small music centre, the Burra Sports Centre and the Cornwall Kitchen, which specialises in take-away food and there is also a Laundromat.  The old shop has been retained for heavier hardware lines.  Photos:

Terowie Water Supply will have some further upgrading.  This time there is a little indication of what was done.  The first steps had evidently been to clean the railway tanks at the town and to remove silt from the Gumbowie Reservoir.

Maintenance will be carried out on the valves in the main and the tank overflow discharge point will be modified.

Obituary.  Mr Bill Brown died at his home ‘The Grove’ in Burra on 23 June aged 56.  He was a past President of the SA Merino Stock Breeders Association and a committee member since the early 1960s.  He was well known as a judge of Merinos at Royal Shows in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth as well as at country shows.  He was President of the SA Stud Merino Breeders Association 1968-70.  He was born on the family property at Elliston in 1921 and he registered his Merino Stud there in 1949.  In 1956 he transferred it to Burra, retaining ‘The Grove’ as the stud name.  At the Perth Royal Show ram sales last year ‘The Grove’ sold an outstanding ram to an East Wickepin WA buyer for $26,000 (by a sire from Ashrose, Hallett; a bloodline originating from Collinsville and used by ‘The Grove’ since its inception.)  In 1960 Mr Brown pioneered the Arubiddy Station on the Nullarbor Plain, which now carries 16,000 Merinos and is run by his sons Peter and Dean.  Mr Brown had been Chairman of the Burra Burra DC 1972-76, a member of the Burra Bowling Club for ten years and in his early days played cricket in Burra.  As well as his sons Mr Brown is survived by his widow, Zita Brown and daughter, Rosemary, now living in Queensland.  The funeral on Monday at St Joseph’s Burra was one of the largest seen in the area.

Burra Hospital.  Chairman of the Board Mr R.K. Pearse delivered the 100th Annual Report and pointed out that in the past two years a nett surplus of $17,595 had been achieved.  This was largely due to the fact that most people were privately insured.  Wages accounted for 78% of costs.  Daily average patient rate was a record 30.72 and 25 babies were born in the year.  The Board was very appreciative of the work of Matron Phillips and her staff.  The work of the Hospital Auxiliary was also appreciated.

[It is an overview rather than a complete history and much of the early history was taken from the souvenir publication released at the time of the Back-to-Burra celebrations in 1925.

Burra Bowls season will be opened on 23 October by Mr Ray Jennison, Chairman of the Burra Burra DC.

In the past year the club has felt severely the losses caused by the deaths of its Patron Dudley Jacka, the Senior Vice-President, Bill Brown and the Treasurer, Clive Neill.

Obituary for Bill Brown

Bill was the founder and manager of ‘The Grove’ Merino Stud.  His administrative skill had been fully used as President of the Merino Stud Breeders’ Association and as Chairman of the Burra Burra DC.  As the Bowling Club’s next President we had every reason to believe his enthusiasm would be channelled for the benefit of the Club and bowls generally.  He skippered a 1st Division team and last year, with John Calnan, won the Club’s Championship Pairs.

Obituary for Dudley Jacka

He was the manager of D.T. Jacka & Co. (Master Builders) and left many monuments to remember him by, including the Burra Bowls Clubhouse.  He was a member for 26 years and did much to benefit the club.  ‘Dud’ supervised many working bees, drew up the tournament sheets and captained a 1st Division team.

Obituary for Clive Neill

Clive had managed the Club bar for the last three years and his care ensured the club’s sound financial position.  He had accepted nomination for Treasurer this year, a position he would have fulfilled to perfection.  He was recognised as one of Burra’s best 1st Division bowlers.

All three deaths of relatively young men were sudden and unexpected and their passing resulted in the following elections: H. Griffen, Committeeman; B. Stockman, Senior Vice-President; I. Allen, Junior Vice-President and D. Field, Treasurer and Selector.

Burra Show

The gate takings were a record $2,100 and the show was extremely successful, as was the licensed ball at the Town Hall in the evening, which had door takings of $2,700, of which the Show Society gets the first $300 profit.  Mr Shipard welcomed visitors and recommended the booklet on the show’s 100 years (at $1 each), which had been launched by Mr Roy Jeffery at Monday night’s Centenary Dinner.

Special features this year were a Grand Parade and sheep dog demonstration.  Three new life members: Mr Rex Warnes, Mr Brian Riggs and Mr Murray Stockman were congratulated.  Rex had served as President for two terms totalling nine years and Murray for three years.  Mr Neil Humphrys of Radio 5AD then opened the show.  He was a grandson of Mr Ray Humphrys [sic: for Roy] whose work for the Burra Show meant a lot to him over many years.  Miss Susan Holly of Adelaide was judged Miss Show Girl.  Jane Kellock won the junior section and Leanne Dunstan the sub-junior.  The Grand Parade was led by the Austin Car Club followed by tractors, implements, vehicles and horses.  The open shearing contest was won by Steve Pittaway and Donald Griffen won the Novice Section.

Jeff Hirschausen writes a long article concerning publicity for events happening in Burra.  He condemns both local apathy and the local paper’s lack of publicity.

The recent Burra-Adelaide Cycle Race – ‘even our substitute paper mentioned it after the event was run.’  It created no interest in Burra.

Hang gliding championships were held last weekend – mentioned in the Advertiser, but local readers had no advice in the local paper.  [And there is no report of it in this week’s paper.]

We boast about a Copper Festival and old building, but overlook what we have to offer sports enthusiasts.

We should also take part in the pleasures such visitors bring and so learn more about why people from outside the district are attracted.

[He ends with an appeal to Burra residents to look seriously at the town and ask if we are ‘just marking time with out historic heritage?’  Or ‘are we progressive?’

[The editor comments that advice about the cycle race arrived only the day before the event.  Arrangements were made to get a description of the race, but the official never sent it.]

After the final distribution of preferences L.G. Wallis of Pt Augusta (ALP) was re-elected.

Wallis	ALP	33,408

Oswald	Lib	33,383

Mr Oswald called for a recount.  Since there are later references in 1978 to Mr Wallis as the Member for Grey, this recount failed to change the result.]

The paper seems to have had local correspondents and to have reported sporting results if and when they were sent in.

Burra news is regular, but generally very brief.

The Council and Burra School affairs are covered regularly, but briefly.

The ‘Out and About’ column continued as in the Burra Record, but usually in a shortened format.

Major events like the Copper Festival received adequate photographic coverage, but scant description.

Although I have not noted sports results, they seemed to me to be far less complete than in the Burra Record.

The quality of the photographs is poor.

The paper usually had 12 pages, but was sometimes large.

There was no improvement in spelling, especially of people’s names.

My impression may be biased, but it seems to me there was better coverage for the Peterborough, Jamestown and Orroroo areas.  Whether this was due to a lack of reporting from Burra or from editorial decisions later in the process, I cannot say.

Burra Uniting Church has called a special meeting to consider the construction of a new manse.  Maintenance of the existing 70-year-old manse was becoming uneconomic.  A special meeting on 20 February will have to approve the purchase of a site selected and the construction of a new manse.  The induction of the new minister is planned for 12 February and the Annual Harvest Festival is scheduled for 26 February.  The new minister is Brian Polkinghorne, who has spent the past seven years in Tanzania [though the paper says Tanziner] working for the World Council of Churches.  He is married with three children and succeeds Rev. A.A. Beames, who retired on 31 December due to ill health.

Burra Burra DC replies to Mr Woolley’s advertisement in the last issue.  The Council can reply as a property owner and had received 46 notices on its own property.  Values had risen strongly and the Council was facing a change in water rating levels.  The Council felt the assessment to be equitable over the whole district.  Council felt a mighty rise in rates was no on and the rating level would be held as close to present levels as possible.  ‘The Council is in the position of being shot at by members of the community too lazy to research their facts before sounding off.’

The Council’s new assessment will not be adopted till after 30 June 1978 and will include any adjustments made as the result of landowners’ objections.

Obituary.  The sudden death of Mr Roy Jeffery commonly referred to by many as ‘The Master’ came as a shock.  He was the Headmaster of Burra High School 1954-58 and he and his wife Gwen soon became part of Burra.  Apart from the school, his greatest occupation during his term as Headmaster was the provision of a swimming pool.  At a meeting in March 1956 he moved the motion that called for a public pool to be built and managed by a community committee.  When it was passed he later became the secretary of the new committee.  In August 1956 excavation work started, but the River Murray floods at Renmark saw earth moving plant rushed there from Burra.  Mr Jeffery was involved in the money raising efforts for the pool – football matches, concerts, and amateur hours.  At the AGM in 1957 it was revealed that over £1,000 was available.  On 7 July that year the floor of the pool was completed and an application made for another grant of £1,500.  The pool walls were completed in November and the pool was fenced in January 1958.

The High School was reclassified in August 1958 and it seemed Mr Jeffery would be transferred.  Representations through the local MP, Mr Quirke, persuaded the Minister to leave him in place rill the end of the year.

Work at the pool went on, with a wading pool and surrounds to be completed and dressing sheds.  A further grant of £750 was received.  By 25 November 1958 the foundations for dressing sheds were down and work began on the walls.  A final push for funds ‘The Fiver Band’ raised £245 quickly and by 2 December reached £415 and it was hoped to open the pool before Christmas.  By 9 December there was £525 in the kitty and on 16 December £580.  At that stage Mr & Mrs Jeffery were being farewelled prior to their transfer to Clare, by numerous sporting and other bodies with which they had been associated.  A capacity crowd at speech night extolled the efforts of Mr Jeffery at the school in his five years there.  Mayor E.T. Baulderstone extended that praise to his efforts in the wider community and in particular to the swimming pool project.  The pool proved very popular in the summer of 1958-59, with takings averaging £20 per week.  It was also used for the Learn to Swim Campaign and many hundreds of young people have since learned to swim in the pool.  Despite being in use, it was decided to defer the official opening till the next season, when the buildings and surroundings would finally be completed.  Mr & Mrs Jeffery returned for the occasion when Mr G. Stanley Hawker performed the official act on 30 January 1960.  Mr Jeffery moved the vote of thanks to Mr Hawker.  He did not build the pool, but his enthusiasm was a major contributing factor towards the completion of the project free from debt and it can truly be said he left his mark in Burra.

D.T. Wedding of Booborowie responds to the Burra Burra DC on assessment values.  He points out that with assessments increasing between 100 and 500% - if the Council considers that equitable – then the minimum statutory rate of 0.5c in the dollar will return much more than previously.  So much for rates not rising significantly.  There is some room for adjustment in the town rate, but not so with rural assessment.  Not only will rural landowners be ‘shot at’ they will be ‘hit’ if the assessments are not adjusted to be more in line with actual values.

A school house was being built in Kangaroo Street, but it was not ready in time, so the family stayed at the Commercial Hotel.  Her sister was seven and tempted sorely by the stairway banister of the first two storey building she had seen.  She slid down the rail, but at the turn half-way down she fell and broke her shoulder.  The doctor was called and confirmed the break, but said he must first attend to her mother, whom he took into Room 1 and delivered a baby girl – now Mrs Drinkwater – on 16 January 1893.  She took the opportunity of a look at room No. 1.

BCS was opened by the Minister of Education Dr Don Hopgood last Friday.

[Photo of the crowd in the quadrangle.]

Mr Ian Allen on behalf of the School Council, Parents & Friends’ association, staff and students, welcomed the visitors and introduced the Principal Mr Chris McCabe.  He said that as most people knew, the Minister of Education had accepted the offer of $20,000 from the community to extend the size of the gymnasium.  He called on Mr Ray Jennison to hand over the Council’s contribution of $10,000.  Mr Jennison said the very welcome decision of the Government to build the new school ended a 30 year battle featuring small periods of optimism and large periods of pessimism.  He said the thought at first of a 20 acre site outside the town was horrifying.  The new school surpassed their wildest dreams and as a Council they were proud of the Community Library.  Burra was placed in the vanguard of new developments and concept and we thank all who had faith in Burra and worked to achieve this magnificent result.  We thank the Government and the Public Buildings Department for giving the Burra Burra DC the earthworks contract, which enabled the Council to hold onto their workforce – it was in effect a grant of $130,000 to the Council.  The decision to have a full-sized gymnasium when the opportunity was offered was an easy one.  Mr Jennison then handed over the cheque, saying: ‘If the Hon. Minister accedes to all our requests for the next twelve months, we’ll probably sign it.’

Mr McCabe then introduced Mr Ron Thamm to hand over the School Council’s $10,000 cheque.  Mr Thamm said it was fitting that Burra should start the second century of education with a facility of this magnitude and grandeur.  He said this is to me a day of thanksgiving and a day to recall the many organisations and people who have played a role and have contributed to the project.

[He went on to mention Mr Birdsie, the architect, the present Government, Mr Claude Allen, Dr Hopgood, the Education Department, past and present District Councils, School Councils and committees and the Public Buildings Department.]  He then handed over the $10,000 cheque.

Mr McCabe called on Dr Hopgood to officially open the school.  Dr Hopgood drew attention to the vast number of people and organisations that have come together to make such a project possible and to make it a success.  Apart from building a school for the children, the Education Department wanted the people of Burra and the surrounding district to share and be part of the new school.  A key feature was the recreation facilities and another was the Community Library.  The Department of Further Education had also made a valuable contribution.  He hoped the co-operation evident to date would long continue.  [He then went on to develop the idea of whole community involvement in education with wide ranging use of school facilities every day of the week and throughout the year.]

He was sure a problem solving and child centred approach was the way forward.  He said budget constraints would prevent this type of facility from being put everywhere in SA, but future building programs would certainly aim to be as flexible as possible so they could accommodate where possible community purposes.  He said community education required some definite guidelines:

An openness of attitude and ease of access for people of all ages.

The community needs to be actively engaged in the education process.

A loose relationship with other services is essential.  Too often schools have been seen as the only resource for the community.

It must be realised that Community Education allows for extensive involvement and community participation in the school and for school participation in the community.  Schools can make their resources available to the community and the community can reciprocate.

In some schools like Burra’s this sharing can become quite complex with special management groups and committees to co-ordinate participation.  He ended by praising the Public Buildings Department, which had completed the project sixteen weeks ahead of schedule and saved on the budgeted cost.  He declared the school open and granted a half-holiday.

Mr McCabe called on Mr Graham Gunn, Member for Eyre, to propose the vote of thanks.  Dennis Thamm and Roxanne Hall, representing the students, presented a collection of Burra booklets to Dr Hopgood.

A Burra Conservation and Planning Study has been initiated jointly by the Burra Burra DC, the National Trust and the SA Government.  Following a grant from the Heritage Commission, a steering committee has engaged a firm of Planning and architectural Consultants to undertake the study over a three month period.  Policies and practical guidelines will be developed to encourage tourism and commerce.  Much of the early settlement, old mines and historic buildings are intact and set within a pleasant town character.  It is important because so much of the original settlement and mines still exist.  Consultants will prepare a planning scheme with policies, guidelines and proposals aimed at enhancing the history and character of the town to ensure future development is sympathetic to the existing character.  The community will be involved by way of public displays later in the project, but persons wishing to be involved are invited to address comments on the project care of the Burra Burra DC.

Burra Mine.  The Burra Mine has been sold.  Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilizers Ltd will buy the assets and business of Poseidon Ltd’s Burra Copper Operation, Samin Ltd.  In 1973 Poseidon and Adelaide Wallaroo jointly formed Adelaide Copper to link the Burra mining resources with the fertiliser group’s manufacturing and marketing techniques.  Adelaide Wallaroo now wholly owns this copper sulphate operation, which almost trebled sales in 1976-77 and is understood to be at least breaking [even] at present.  The Burra sales will need approval by the SA Mines Minister of the transfer of the mining leases to Adelaide-Wallaroo.  The present depressed state of the copper price and markets has had an effect on the Mine, but a recent statement by the Minister for Trade and Resources Mr Anthony indicated a promising future.  He said Samin had said it expected to substantially increase sales to Australian markets [for copper oxide] in 1978.  Negotiations are being conducted for increased sales to the US at more favourable prices.

Burra Burra DC

Council intends to apply for a debenture loan of $20,000 to finance purchase of a new office accounting machine and also a loan of $45,000 for two new tip trucks.  The existing trucks will be allocated to Mt Bryan and Burra DFS to modernise their plant.

Applications will soon be called for the position of District Clerk as Mr T.G. Perry is expected to retire at the end of 1980.

The Public Meeting on Burra Heritage attracted over 100 and several discussion groups were formed.  Some suggestions emerging from them were:

Tourism needs promotion

The Morgan-Spalding Road needs to be sealed as a basic tourist requirement

$1 spent in the town generates a further $2

The town and district cannot be seen separately

Burra is a living town with quality and character and new development should be in sympathy with that

The Burra Creek area needs development

A tourist office and officer are needed

Obituary.  Dr Martin Francis Toal DD died in Melbourne on 22 April aged 77.  He was well known in the Burra and Jamestown area and his pastoral work in the Burra Parish dated back to 1930.  Though stationed at Jamestown, he from time to time took turns with Monsignor F.A. Hentschke to help out Fr Morrissey in Burra.  Fr Morrissy remained in charge certainly until mid 1937, but records show Dr Toal was in residence there by October 1937 and he stayed till the end of 1948, however he also served as an interpreter and chaplain at Loveday Internment Camp from the end of 1941 to June 1942.  He was later appointed to the staff of St Francis Xavier’s Seminary in the Philosophy Faculty and his pastoral work ceased.  When a new priestly staff was provided by the Vincentian Order Dr Toal was granted leave to study overseas and the greater part of his research was done in Rome.  He spent more than 25 years of painstaking study and translation on scripture used in the Liturgy of the Church from the early Greek Fathers.  His latest work covering eleven years of research is in the process of publication. Thirty-six priests led by Bishop Bryan Gallagher con-celebrated Requiem Mass with his brother, Monsignor T.F. Toal in St James Church, Jamestown, on 26 April.  He had died in Melbourne on 23 April.  Religious, laity and children filled the church for the ceremony.  Bishop Gallagher paid tribute to Dr Toal’s work as a pastor and scholar of international stature and an outstanding member of the Australian catholic priesthood.  The Burra Parish was represented by Mr Jim Quinn of Mt Bryan, Chairman of the Burra-Spalding Pastoral Council.

Mr & Mrs Brian Pallot of Victoria visited Burra and praised it for its cleanliness and tourist potential, marvelling at the fine stonework and the character to be seen in the school, churches, Paxton Square and the Gaol.  They only regretted the limited opening times for the National Trust properties and the need to keep places like the Gaol locked because of vandalism.

Spalding-Booborowie-Morgan Road

In reply to a question in the House of Representatives from the Member for Grey, the Minister of Transport said there was no proposal to declare this road a National Commerce Road.  Upgrading to open surface standard began in 1968-69.  Upgrading ceased after 1972-73 for the Burra-Morgan sections and after 1973-74 for the Spalding-Burra section due to shortage of funds.  $25,000 this year has enabled the Burra Burra DC to construct 3.2 km to sub-base standard.  Work is proceeding at present.  It was hoped to finance some work between Burra and Spalding in the next two years.

Burra’s Future was discussed at a public meeting last week.  Mr Harry Dowling, Yorke Peninsula Tourist Officer, gave a talk on what had been done there.  Group discussions followed.  Some of the recommendations:

Tourism should be encouraged

Historic aspects of the town should be restored or developed

Tourism would aid employment

A tourist officer should be appointed

Cottage industries could be encouraged

Community involvement was thought necessary

Non tourist areas of the economy must also be encouraged

An over reliance on tourism was not a good thing

Johnny Green was suggested as a logo

A souvenir range needs to be developed

Present facilities need to be upgraded

The creek area in Burra needs development

Burra could also be encouraged as a retirement centre

Tourism is a third mainstay after agriculture and mining (though the prospect of mining has been doubtful, it is perhaps a bit better after recent developments.  It was seen as a short term benefit; perhaps 10-15 years.)

A District Progress Association was suggested

The standard of accommodation needed improving even more than supplying more of it.

A residence and kiosk on the caravan park was suggested

The sealing of access roads to the town was seen as a basic need

Most groups saw tourism as important, but as only part of the town’s future.  Serving the agricultural community must remain a core activity.  One group saw tourism as having a minor role.

Burra Common Effluent Scheme

Five men have been working on the scheme since December and have generally impressed locals with their working habits and handling of equipment, even though most are new to the firm of Snowcrete Services and virtually learned on the job.  Mark Hoffmann (21) is the back hoe operator and has been digging trenches up to 11 feet deep.  His father, Eric Hoffmann of Tanunda owns the business and Mark has been with the firm for five years.  Peter Jones (19) of Gawler is the loader driver and has been with the firm for two years.  He forms the metal bed in trenches and backfills.  Rudy Sphere (22) is a newcomer and a truck driver.  Rick Thiele (18) of Blanchetown has been with them for twelve months.  He prepares the metal beds and lays the pipes.  David Wilkinson (35) is foreman with eight years with the company, and he does the line and level reading and fills in wherever needed.  The Public Health Department is represented by former local Maurice Woollacott.  The gang commenced work at the oxidation lagoon in the creek area below the cemetery and the project is due for completion in July.  There are 1,196 yards of trench with six inch pipes, 2,781 yards with four inch pipe and 706 yards of four inch connecting pipes to 131 properties.  There is then 2,062 yards of trench to take the pump line.  The gang has managed to work on a given section each day with minimum inconvenience to residents and traffic.  They have managed to avoid PMG cables and water pipes, except for one of the latter in Market Square.  The hardest digging was in Lewis Street in the Housing Trust area where jack hammers were needed.  There were hard sections in Commercial Street too, but the back hoe and ripper sufficed.

Jubilee 150 Parade.  Burra will have a float with the theme ‘Burra – saving SA’ in the Adelaide Jubilee Procession on New Year’s Day.  President of Burra National Trust, Mrs Maureen Wright, said the discovery of copper in Burra in 1845 had saved the colony’s ailing finances.  She said the float would probably feature an historic buggy and wagon surrounded by people in the costume of the 1840s.  A meeting to organise Burra’s contribution has been called for 22 August.

Burra’s Jubilee Copper Festival

Plans are on track according to committee secretary, Ellie Nicholls.  The festival will begin on the Sunday of the long weekend with a procession of bands, vintage and veteran cars and local people in costume.

Burra Burra DC has increased its rates by an overall 11.5%.  Burra Town residents will face an increase of 24%, while rural rates rise by 7.57%.  Booborowie & Mt Bryan rates rise 9.9% and those in Farrell Flat by 8.25%.  Burra District Clerk said the increases were due to ever increasing fixed operating costs.  Council had allocated $100,000 for Market Square development and half of that came from the Jubilee 150 Road Assets Program.  Plans had yet to be finalised for the pedestrian mall, new car parking arrangements and safer traffic control.  $120,000 was allocated for local road maintenance.

Burra National Trust will welcome a visit by the Department of Mines and Energy’s geologist and information officer, Mr Greg Drew on 7 September.  He will give an illustrated account of his recent trip to the copper mines of Cornwall.  His information will be of great use when the Morphett pumphouse at Burra was restored.  This was operating in the days before photography was developed and there are no good pictures of what it looked like, said Branch President Maureen Wright.  Mr Drew will conduct a tour of the Morphett’s pumphouse, the old smelts area and the buddle pits on 8 September.  Many of those who went on his last tour in April said they had not realised how historically fascinating the area was and how much remained there.  About 25 people had gone on that tour.  Mr Drew is currently researching Morphett’s pumphouse, winding house, and mine, with a view to the restoration of the pumphouse.  The buildings and shaft are currently in ruins and fenced off from the public because they are dangerous.

The 5th Annual Burra Yacht Club Regatta will be held 13 October.  A feature this year will be the Copper Man Competition, said Secretary Steve Woolley.  There will also be a Clare-Burra Barrow Push.  Four teams have so far entered.  This will provide experience for the big Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push planned for January 1986.  The Royal Caledonian Pipe Band will also be present.  There will be events for Juniors, Seniors and Ladies as well as Open Events.  The Tracker James Perpetual Trophy will be awarded to the boat and crew with the nest results at the end of the day.  This was first awarded in 1983 to commemorate one of the characters who first started the regatta.  According to Mr Woolley the idea for the event was born in the mid 1970s during ‘one of Burra’s notorious floods’.  Peter Reilly and Tracker James had a discussion about who could sail furthest down the Burra Creek.  They decided to put claims to the test over the long weekend in October.  No one knows what really happened, but it is believed that both the home-made craft sank and quite a quantity of beer was consumed.  As a result the rules of the regatta allow anything from craft made from beer cans to bathtubs as long as they can float.  Boats must carry a sail of at least one square metre and can be no larger than two metres square.  But Mr Woolley dais any entries bearing any resemblance to a real yacht would probably be banned.  Last year there were 160 entries and about 2,000 spectators.  About $2,000 was raised for local charities and for the Yacht Club’s beautification program for the creek banks.  There is a plan for a new gate in the weir so that the creek could be cleaned out regularly.  A cabaret in the Town Hall will conclude the event.

The Burra Show will be opened on 12 October by Mr John Olsen the Member for Rocky River.  A new section this year will be for Inventions.  There will also be two new classes in the Wool Section.

Burra Kindergarten children have a new playground environment to enjoy thanks to the hard work of Mr Barry Bull.  He is the husband of the Director, Julie Bull, and together they drew up plans to improve the outdoor play facilities after the Management Committee decided to expand the play area.  The new area includes a pine lookout and platform.

BCS will have a vacation recreation program from 9 to 13 September.

St Joseph’s Catholic School at Terowie has been donated by Bishop De Campo to the Terowie Senior Citizen’s Association.  The Catholic school was first started in Terowie in 1884 by Mr T. Moore.  In 1911 His Lordship Bishop Norton applied for staff from the Provincial of the Sisters of St Joseph who sent Sisters Melita, Aidan and Antoinette.  The school closed in 1966.

Hallett will hold a Back-to-Hallett weekend from 17-19 May 1986 as part of the State Jubilee 150 celebrations.

Greg Drew, a geologist from the Department of Mines & Energy, presented an illustrated talk to about 40 people at a National Trust social evening.  He spoke on his recent visit to the tin and copper mining areas of Cornwall.  He said that Burra’s pumphouses were probably in a better condition than the hundreds in grey granite in Cornwall.  The Burra Mine had been virtually untouched for [almost] a century before the Samin Company re-opened the mine in 1969.  Branch President Mrs Wright said the old open cut had been quite picturesque with the pool being used as the local swimming hole.  Mr Drew had slides of the old open cut and of the old chimney before its relocation at the mine entrance and the blowing up of its associated pumphouse.  Mrs Wright said the stone from the pumphouse had been used in other restoration work around the town.  Mr Drew led a tour of the mine the next day.  About 40 people took part.  Mr Drew said it was a myth that the round chimneys were built by Cornishmen and the square ones by Welsh.  He had proof that the square chimney at the mine site was built by a Cornishman.  The tour included the buddle pits and the smelting area.

Burra Burra DC has taken the first steps to draw up a new development plan.  A committee has been established to draw up a brief to present to consultants and it is hoped to appoint the consultants at the next meeting of Council.  The Administrative Planning Officer, Mr John Brak said each Council was required to prepare a supplementary development plan for presentation to the Minister of Environment & Planning and for approval by Parliament.  These had to be enlarged local versions of the State development Plan.  He expected the process to take about twelve months.

The Sacred Dance Group from Adelaide will visit Burra on 14 September and will perform at BCS.  Dance is being rediscovered in the Uniting Church as a means of Christian celebration and worship.

Accident.  A 21-year-old motorcyclist was blown from his bike on Monday when a cool change swept through the district.  Mr Adam Carnie of Broken Hill was travelling at about 100 k.p.h. about 10 km south of Burra when the accident occurred.  He suffered cuts, abrasions and a broken ankle.  About $1,000 damage was done to the motorcycle.

Burra Motor Co. was subject to an attempted break-in last Wednesday morning, but the intruders fled when they set off a burglar alarm.

Burra Heritage Grant Re-allocated

The Burra Burra DC has sent a telegram to the Federal Minister of Sport & Recreation, Mr John Brown, asking him to investigate the rumour that $210,000 of Burra’s Jubilee 150 grant has been re-allocated.  District Clerk Mr Alan Dwyer said the Council was seeking an investigation into the activities of the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning and of the Jubilee 150 Board before the money was re-allocated.  The Council considers the re-allocation unacceptable and unfair.  Federal MP for Wakefield Mr Neil Andrew and the State member for Eyre were both following the matter up, but it is believed that the Premier Mr Bannon would not oppose the re-allocation.  It is believed the money has been re-allocated to the Port Adelaide Maritime Museum because that project had run over budget.  Mr Dwyer pointed out the coincidence that there is an Independent Labor candidate running against the sitting Labor member in Port Adelaide.  Burra heritage projects had been allocated $470,000 and its spending had been decided by the Jubilee 150 Board and the steering committee of the Burra Council.  $150,000 had been spent on Paxton Cottages and $30,000 was being spent on the Bon Accord site.  The remainder was to have been spent on Morphett’s pumphouse and a Copper Interpretive Centre.  Mr Dwyer said the delay in spending the grant was due to a number of factors including the interference by the Heritage Conservation Branch of the Department of Environment and planning, which had refused to allow construction of the centre on the site of the old boiler house adjacent to Morphett’s pumphouse.   The manager of the Heritage Conservation Branch Mr John Womersley said the new building would be inappropriate to the character of the pumphouse and is believed to have recommended the re-allocation of the grant money.  The District Clerk said the Council had originally bought the old Salvation Army Citadel to house the interpretative centre, but the Heritage Conservation Branch had rejected that as not having either the right social atmosphere or the rite site.  The Council then proposed the Bon Accord Mine site, but this in turn was rejected as being the ‘back door’ of the mine area.  Finally a site some 200 m from Morphett’s Pumphouse was approved, but after an architect had prepared plans it was found that site would double the costs allocated for the project.  The architect was sacked and a new proposal for a smaller building on the old boiler house site was submitted to the Jubilee 150 Board on 21 August.  They rejected it.

Cr Helen Stockman said the Council just wanted to show that the boiler house option was feasible, but had been blocked by the Heritage Conservation Branch.  Now it seemed the town would lose the project altogether without even being consulted.  The Council wanted a meeting between the executive committee of the Jubilee 150 Board and the working party of the Heritage Conservation Board.

The Mid North Region Tourist Association has organised a meeting of local government representatives at Burra next Tuesday.  The role of local government in developing tourism will be discussed.  More than 80 representatives will attend.  Mrs Jenny O’Connor, tour operator and Tourism Officer, will conduct a guided tour of historic sites.  After a luncheon the seminar will be opened by Mr Gordon Bruce MLC who is standing in for the Minister for Tourism, Ms Barbara Wiese.  Mr Jim Hullick, secretary-general of the Local Government Association will give the keynote address.

The Burra-Hanson Road will be constructed by R.K. & B.J. Matulick Pty Ltd which has won the $2.5 million tender to construct 14.5 km of the Barrier Highway stretching from 3.5 km south of Burra to 5.5 km south of Hanson.  It will include about 0.6 km of the Clare-Hanson Road at it junction with the Barrier Highway.  Funds come from the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund.

BCS won 5 ribbons in the ‘Led Steer’ section of the Royal Adelaide Show this year.  This has been the best effort in the school’s history. The school has had an agricultural program for eight years and has competed at the Royal Adelaide Show for four years.  [Further details are printed.]

The Caring & Sharing Group meeting on 24 September will consider ‘Marriage difficulties and the role of the counselling centre’.

Burra National Trust will again operate the passport system for the October long weekend.  Members will be on hand at the sites and the Trust will also display three of the town’s old fire engines at the Burra show on 12 October.  They were last displayed at the 1983 Copper Festival.  At the Burra Yacht Club Regatta the National Trust will provide billy tea and damper.  The Trust is running a bus tour on 3 November to the Gladstone Gaol, Orroroo’s Yesteryear Gallery and to Terowie.

Market Square.  The Burra Burra DC has received a Community Employment Grant of $54,000 for the redevelopment of Market Square.  It will cover a pedestrian mall, new car parking arrangements and better traffic management.  A condition of the grant is that it provide work for five people; five of the jobs to go to long term unemployed and two to women.

The Burra Burra DC is circulating a petition aiming to save the Copper Interpretation Centre by having the $470,000 of Jubilee 150 money restored to Burra.

Burra Burra DC is concerned at the cut to roads grants.  For the past five years the Council had received $200,000 annually to upgrade the Spalding-Burra Road and the Burra-Morgan Road.  Nothing has been allocated for 1985-86.  They were not made aware of this cut to Arterial Road Grants until after they had framed their budget.  Despite appeals to MPs and the Highways Department there has so far been no explanation for the cut.  Cr Des Woolley said the Council had been ‘at war’ with the Department over the sealing of the Burra-Morgan road for some years.  It was only after a fatality on the road several years ago that finds were allocated.  Tour operators avoid running their buses on the road, he said.  Council has also received a 13% cut in funding for other roads; down to $61,000 from $70,000 in 1984.  Verbal advice from the Chairman of the Local Roads Advisory Committee had led them to expect a 10% increase.

The Burra National Trust will have guides to take people around the Trust’s Malowen Lowarth Cottage (Hollyhock Garden) over the October long weekend.  The cottage is one of the 1850s cottages in Paxton Square on the eastern side of Paxton Square [Kingston Street].  The cottage committee had spent many Thursday mornings preparing the three-roomed cottage.  It features authentic polished-earth floors and canvas ceilings in two of the rooms.  It is furnished with articles from the mid nineteenth century.  About 200 items are used in the display.  It is intended to set up a cottage garden with a vegetable patch and flower bed of marigolds, daisies and geraniums.

The New Dalgety Bennetts Farmers Building in Market Square was opened last week by Mr Ron Pearse, former manager of the now closed Koonoona Merino Stud.  About 200 people attended.    The historic façade and a new bull-nosed verandah are designed to complement Burra’s heritage.  Manager Mr Andrew Butler said the new premises offer a better showroom and greatly improved product display.  The firm’s Northern Regional Manage Mr John Secomb said when he started in Burra with Oates Ltd in 1960 there were five stock agents in the town and now there were two.  The firm’s General Manager Mr Noel O’Brien said the stone from the old demolished Farmers’ Union building had been used to make the new façade.  [Photo of Mr Noel O’Brien and Mr Andrew Butler.]

The 1986 Barrow Push may have a Texan team in the contest.  This follows the sending of a video tape of the 1983 & 1985 Pushes to Dr Ian McPhail who is organising the Texan Sesquicentenary and Mayor Brough of Kerrville, which is Burra’s twin town in Texas.  So far there are 11 confirmed entries and 8 tentative ones in the 1986 Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push.  Registrations close 12 December.

1986 Jubilee Float.  The float is making progress.  Nick van Buuren and Glen Ward are building a two-and-a-half metre model of Morphett’s Pumphouse, complete with a steam engine, which will be a feature of the float.  Also on the float will be ore stampers, a trommel-screen and a timber replica of a miner’s home, based on a Paxton Square cottage.  The display will be mounted on a 12-metre trailer, which will also carry paintings of the interior of the mine by BCS Art Teacher Mr roger Boehm.  The $2,100 cost has been supplied by the mine and local sporting bodies, but donations are still needed.  It is hoped that six adults and eight children in period costume will accompany the float.

The New Dalgety Bennetts Premises in Burra has been awarded a Civic Trust brickbat.  The Trust described the building as a ‘large, graceless, industrial steel shed finished in gleaming white with a patch of stone veneer at the front set between dignified heritage buildings.’

‘An even plainer industrial character shows from Paxton Square across the Creek.’

The Trust was also concerned that the location would bring trucks into what should be a quiet part of the town centre.

Northern Regional Manager John Secomb said he was disappointed, but not surprised by the award.  He said the firm went to great lengths to put on a bluestone façade and the whole development was passed through the proper channels and approved by the Council.  A large cross-section of people had expressed their approval.

Mr Allan Dwyer, the District Clerk, will leave soon for Broken Hill where he has been appointed Deputy Clerk.  Council Chairman Mr Hawker said Mr Dwyer was an outstanding accounting and fianancial expert who had brought a range of skills to the job that would not normally be found in a town clerk in SA.  Mr Dwyer had done much in the organising of the Barrow Push to Clare this weekend and the one to Broken Hill in January 1986.

BCS is attempting to become the first state school in SA to offer boarding facilities.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said a small sub-committee of the school and the Burra District Council had approached the Minister of Education with a proposal for a 60-bed facility on the school campus.  The Director General of Education has established a working party, chaired by the Director of the Western Region Mr Keith Ware.  Local MPs were supportive.  The aim was to enable isolated students who now did correspondence courses to have access to a school.  Students from small country towns would also be accommodated.  Mr Henderson said the school would like the facility to be housed in a number of small cottage-type units with a recreations room, a study room and a sick bay with a trained nurse and laundry facilities.  Getting approval will be difficult because it involves a change in Government policy, which has for 40 years concentrated on developing a superb correspondence system.

Burra Show.  Report of the President Mr Jock Duncan for 1985.

I feel the Burra Show is well balanced and offers something for everyone.  This year’s show will be opened by the Leader of the Opposition Mr John Olsen.

[The report then outlines the various sections in the 1985 show so that this is not really a report on 1985, but merely spruiking for the 1985 show.]

He does say that this year costs have risen and the Society had spent more than $3,000 in maintenance, sign-writing, upgrading of pavilions and bituminising roads.  He was confident that due to the show being on a long weekend, it would continue to attract visitors and so be a financial success.  He thanks in particular the secretary Mrs Jean Jamieson and also repeats the frequent error of mistakenly numbering the shows; in this case wrongly claiming the 1985 show is the 108th.  [Photo of Mr Duncan painting a showground gate.]

Mrs Jean Jamieson is the hard working Secretary of the Burra Show Society.  She says entries in most sections were up at this time.  There were two areas of concern; horse events she thought suffered from non-affiliation with the Equestrian Federation of Australia and the sheep section could be affected by the new brucellosis testing at the Royal Adelaide Show.

Burra DC will appeal against the Industrial Court’s order to reinstate and compensate the wages of a council overseer who was dismissed in 1982 because of alleged sexual misconduct.  This was decided at a special Council meeting on Tuesday night.  The court ruled on Friday that Mr Ronald Moreland had been dismissed after being wrongfully accused of sexual harassment and blackmail.  The Council was told it could face a payment of up to $100,000 in lost wages, in addition to having to pay the wages of two overseers once Mr Moreland was reinstated.  Mr B.V. Shillabeer, in handing down the decision, said community attitudes in Burra were largely to blame for Mr Moreland’s wrongful dismissal.  The special meeting of Council was called when Councillors and workmen involved in the case threatened to resign when Mr Moreland reported for work on Tuesday.  The District Clerk Mr Allan Dwyer said Mr Moreland had been reinstated last Friday, but this would be suspended once the appeal was lodged, pending a court decision.

Burra Show opened at 8 a.m. in pouring rain, but when show goers began to arrive at about 10 a.m. the weather had cleared.  Miss Vanessa Pearce was Miss Show Girl with the Junior Miss title going to Alison Reed.  Sonia Fuller won in the Sub-Junior section and Cheree Devenson in the Mini Miss Show Girl Section. Dan Brophy’s boxing show was popular.  In the shearing competition the novice section was won by Mr J. Robinson of Booborowie and he also won the local section.  In the new inventions section Mr M. Pearce of Mt Bryan was the winner with a device to help feed sheep from the back of a utility.  [A selection of other results is printed.]

Burra SES Branch had fallen to six members when a meeting was called last Wednesday.  Fifteen people attended and the unanimous decision was made to continue.  A recruitment drive will now be held.  Interim Director is Steve Woolley.  Female members were encouraged.  There would also be a drive for funds.  The SES’s Landcruiser was fairly old and a new four wheel drive vehicle was needed.  Other emergency rescue equipment had also fallen into disrepair.  In the future there would be regular meetings on Thursday nights.

Burra Greening Australia District Committee is seeking new members.  Chairman Dave Parnell said the group is planting the banks of the Burra Creek and are willing to plant trees on private land if the owners are willing to prepare the land, pay for the trees and care for them.  They recently planted trees on Bruce Stockman’s property.   So far they have planted some 550 trees.  The first Burra Tree Committee failed from lack of Council and other Government support and waning interest.  A new group was then formed as part of the Courthouse Co-op for the unemployed and the remaining members of that group were the nucleus for the Greening Australia group.  They had received a grant of $1,000 in 1984, which was used for a watering tank, tree guards and the Burra Creek project.  There is a core group of about 12 members who spend a couple of hours on Sunday afternoons to plant trees around Burra.

Burra DC is considering applying for a Bicentennial Grant to replace the $210,000 grant which was re-allocated to another Jubilee 150 project.  A spokesman for the Jubilee 150 Board said a decision on which project would get the money would not be made till late October.  Council’s Planning & Administration Officer Mr John Brak said the Council would consider applying for a larger grant for the Copper Interpretive Centre, which the architect originally said would cost about $450,000.  The fulfilment of the original plan would be their first objective, but they would also consider alternative ideas.  One alternative would be the restoration of all of the mine buildings and of shafts so that tourists could go underground.  Council also had a new submission for a grant for upgrading the Burra-Morgan Road.

The Burra DC is planning to hold a Civic Ball for Jubilee 150 in 1986.

Market Square redevelopment has begun with the undergrounding of power lines.  This will add to the aesthetics of the area and enhance the heritage value said Mr John Brak.  It would also reduce ETSA’s maintenance costs.  The Council wanted to underground power lines where possible and in 1980 had done so along Bridge Terrace to restore the streetscape to as close to original as possible.  [Photo.]

Accident.  An ANR employee received minor injuries when the section car he was riding on was hit by a car at the level crossing about 2 km east of Farrell Flat on Tuesday morning at about 8.30 a.m.  Adrian Clark of Mannum had been driving the car and he had seen the section car, but his vehicle had skidded on the wet road, done a 180° turn and the back of the car struck the section car.

The Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push on the Australia Day long weekend in January 1986 will have a first prize of $10,000.  There are entries from all over Australia.  Likely local entries include the Brother Breathers, Super Mac, the Rat Racers from Booborowie and the Clare Crushers, but so far only the Burra Barrow Birds have formally entered.  Committee Secretary Chris Reed says he has been advised there will be a team from Kerrville, Texas (Burra’s twin town).  If Mr Bob Hawke accepts the invitation to present the prizes he will be the first Prime Minister to visit the town since Billy Hughes in 1924*.  The Burra Breathers won the warm up Clare-Burra push on 13 October and are in good form as likely winners.  They covered the 44.7 km push in 1 hour 53 minutes at an average 23.74 k.p.h.  In the 1983 race the average was 20.03 k.p.h. and for the 1985 race was 21.92 k.p.h.  The Clare-Burra race had $900 worth of prizes.

[*This claim is incorrect.  W. Hughes visited twice as PM, on 28 August 1920 and 29 March 1922.  After that there was a visit by S.M. Bruce in March 1925 when he was PM and from J.B. Chifley when he was PM in 1946.]

Burra Swimming Pool is ready for the coming summer.  A new chlorine system and new pipes have been installed at a cost of c. $5,000.  The new system should cost about $300 less per year to operate as well as being safer and easier to run.  Adelaide & Wallaroo Fertilisers Ltd donated materials worth about $3,000 and the Burra Council will pay $1,000 towards the refurbishment.

The SA Choral Association will visit Burra on 10 November and will perform Handel’s Messiah in St Mary’s Church.  There will be about 130 singers.  Soloists will be: Celine Egar (soprano), June Klinberg (contralto), David Galliver (tenor) and Ralph Hatcher (bass).

Frank Fennell celebrated 25 years with Jennison’s Tyre Service with a barbecue at the Golf Clubhouse on 24 October.  Mt Ray Jennison presented him with a cheque and a gold watch.  Frank is 57 and originally came from Robe.  He first came to Burra as a shearer and worked in the area for 17 years.  He then worked for the Burra Burra DC for three years before joining Jennison’s.  In the early days there he and Mr Jennison had worked on fridges and televisions as well as tyres.  Mr Fennell will continue to work in the business, which has recently been sold to Ron & Geraldine Smedley.  The new business will be known as Burra Tyres.  He said that the recent fire at the store had speeded up Mr Jennison’s decision to sell the business and retire to Port Vincent to enjoy fishing and golf.

Obituary.  Ellen (Nanna) Ryan, a well-known and well-loved Burra identity has died in Adelaide at the age of 96.  She was born in Broken Hill, but was brought to Carrieton at the age of two to live with her aunt after her mother died.  Ellen came to Burra when she married and lived in a Miner’s cottage in Truro Street for over 70 years.  She was actively involved in many community groups, including the Red Cross and the CWA.

Burra Branch of the National Trust had a bus tour of historic sites in Gladstone, Orroroo and Terowie.  Twenty-two members visited the Gladstone Gaol, a wattle and daub cottage at Orroroo and the Yesteryear Costume Gallery and finished with afternoon tea at Terowie where Mrs Marina Gray of Terowie’s Citizen’s Association introduced the group to the collection of historical buildings in the main street the association is restoring.  The branch raised $80 from the trip.

Mr Neil Andrew MP presented an Australian flag to the Burra Girl Guides and Brownies on 23 October.

Burra National Trust has written to the Burra DC offering suggestions about the Market Square re-development.  The Trust was concerned that it had not been consulted about the plans and while they supported the re-development in principle, they were concerned that the Council seems to have accepted inexpensive light poles without making an effort to see what else was available.  President Maureen Wright said at present it looks like an aluminium jungle.  Council had decided to use slate salvaged from the foyer of the school rather than pavers.  The Trust was certainly pleased to see the undergrounding of the power supply.

Mt Bryan Gala Weekend was a great success according to Mrs Beth Oakley, one of the organisers.  About 400 attended the gala ball and the $4,800 raised by the weekend will be shared by ten community groups.  The celebrations began with a procession on Saturday morning, which included three old fire engines from Burra and Clydesdale horses from Geralka Farm.  A float commemorating the 75th birthday of the Soldiers’ Memorial Hall featured old style dancing.  Seven members of the Yankalilla Light Horse, clad in WWI uniforms marched and one float featured an old time schoolroom.  After the parade the book Razorback Country was launched by its publisher Mr Peter Cotton from Adelaide.  It was written by local resident Mrs Ruth Stolte.    250 copies were sold over the weekend.  Mrs Oakley said 400 people attended the barbecue lunch.  In the afternoon the Light Horse Brigade gave a demonstration of tent pegging and there were also sheep dog trials and a blade shearing demonstration.  Hay rides were popular and there was a bus tour of the old Mt Bryan Station and other homesteads.  The oldest former resident to return was Mr Vic Pearce 91, of Adelaide.  Static displays included lead lighting by Helen Reed, floral art by Joyce Lloyd and wood carving by Audrey van Buuren (all of Burra).  Pat Brereton’s water-colour scenes also proved popular.  200 people crammed the hall for the gala ball.  The master of ceremonies there was Mr Tim Butler of Radio 5CK.  Ralph Oakley won the beard-growing contest. Father Lawrie Quinn led the ecumenical church service on Sunday assisted by Uniting Church Minister Malcolm Thomas, Fr Richard Morris of the Anglican Church and Fr Kenny from the Roman Catholic Church.

Market Square.  A petition has been presented to the Burra DC calling for further work on Market Square to be postponed pending the publishing of an artist’s impression and its examination at a public meeting.  It was initiated by the Burra branch of the National Trust and attracted 570 signatures.  It was presented to the Council by President Maureen Wright at their Monday night meeting.  She pointed out that Burra had more heritage listed buildings per square kilometre than any other town in Australia and was among the six most significant heritage towns in Australia.  For these reasons the Council should seek the input of a qualified town planner with heritage experience before proceeding further.  She said that while some suggestions, like the use of late paving had been taken on board, other aspect, such as lighting, had been rushed through.  The Highways department spokesman said non-approved lighting would not attract the 50% subsidy on cost and maintenance.  Mrs Wright said that all they wanted was for the Council to investigate all possibilities.  Mr Des Menz, the Acting District Clerk, said the meeting had been valuable in bringing public opinion out in the open.  Mrs Wright would be invited to a Council executive meeting to be called soon to discuss the petition’s proposals.

Burra SES held a mock rescue of a car accident as the culmination of two weekends of training at Deep Creek.  Nine members took part with three SES instructors from Laura and Divisional Officer Mr I. McDonough.  A gutted Toyota Crown was donated by Mr B. Preiss and Mr D. Woolley towed it to the area and dropped it in the creek.  A fake victim, Mr Giles Ackford of Adelaide was then placed in the wreckage.  The victim had to be blanket-lifted out through the broken windscreen and then placed into a ‘Stoke’s litter’ and lifted vertically up the concrete retaining wall of the creek.  The Laura instructors demonstrated how to use the ‘jaws of life’ to open the car’s roof.

The Caring and Sharing Group has had a successful year according to co-ordinator Mrs Toni Brown.  An over 50s running group and a walking group had been established and the elderly visitation program set up in 1984 had been continued.  $150 worth of books had been donated to the Community Library.  A new Burra doctor, Dr Ash Thomas had addressed the group in November on their role in psychiatric care.  Elections saw Mrs Toni Brown continue as co-ordinator; Mrs Val Hill, assistant co-ordinator; Mrs Lois Maxstead [sic: for Maxted] is the new secretary and Mrs May Fahlbusch is the new treasurer.

Football.  The Burra Football Club has agreed to amalgamate with the Booborowie-Hallett Club if certain conditions are met.  70% of members attending a special meeting on 27 November agreed to the move.  This was a complete reversal of an earlier decision in November.  This was probably due to the new conditions specified.  Burra asked that all games be played at Burra and the name of the amalgamated club be Burra-Booborowie-Hallett rather than North-East Districts.  Both the existing clubs believed they would struggle to field teams in all divisions in the future.  The number of juniors was expected to drop dramatically in the 1990s.  Currently there were only 80 senior male students at BCS.  The amalgamation would reduce the number of team places from 160 to 80.  The amalgamation would lead to a stronger club and would strengthen the very successful Burra Sports and Community Club.  Booborowie-Hallett would now consider the proposal with the new conditions.  If amalgamation proceeded Burra Football Club would not immediately disband, but would instead go into recess for two years.

BCS.  Three Year 12 students have been selected in the State Team for the Australian All-School Athletics Competition in Perth in December: Craig McDowell (U19 high jump), Graham Klessell (U19 javelin) and Rosie Lloyd (U19 400 m hurdles, 400 m sprint & 4 x 400 m relay).  Rosie Lloyd recently came second to Glynnis Nunn in a 400 m hurdle event.

Redruth Gaol is planned to be the location for an event at the Copper Festival Jubilee 150 event over the long weekend in October 1986.Third year drama students at Flinders University will put on an event based on the social history of Burra using music, lighting and other effects.  Local teacher, Miss Cheryl John will be the local co-ordinator.  [Photo of the Gaol entrance.]

Burra’s Festival of Carols drew about 200 at the Civic Centre last Sunday.  The weather had proved too cold and wet for the event to be held at the Burra Hospital grounds.  Mrs Annie Rees played the piano.  Clarinet solos were played by BCS students Kerry Green and Joanne Baulderstone and a flute duet by Alicia Fidock and Pacquita Kuiessner [sic: for Quiessner].  Jack Kleinig was MC, Bible reading was given by Mrs Jan Letcher and Fr Eugene Kenny of St Joseph’s delivered the benediction.  About $174 was collected for the Christmas Bowl Appeal.

BCS students excelled at the National All Schools Athletics Competition in Perth.  Rosie Lloyd won a gold medal in the 400 m sprint and captained the SA team.  She has been selected got the Australian Junior team to go to New Zealand in January.  Graham Klessell came 4th in the javelin and has also been selected to compete in New Zealand.

St Mary’s Church has received a grant from the Department of Environment and planning for painting work.  During 1986 about $25,000 will be spent on the 106-year-old building.  Cement mortar in the western wall was fretting.  There had been problems ever since lime mortar had been removed about 26 years ago.  It was hoped repairs would be completed by 31 March.

Adelaide sculptor Lady Jocelyn Hicks has offered the church a bas-relief sculpture in wood about 1 m x 1.35 m, with a face depth of 10 cm.  The offer has been accepted and the sculpture of the Madonna and Child will be placed on the south wall between stained glass windows depicting the Virgin Mary and Christ the Good Shepherd.

The Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push left Broken Hill yesterday.  Artist Pro Hart flagged off the teams.  The push is in five sections.  Yesterday the teams pushed their barrows 48.3 km to Cockburn.  Today the run is to Olary and tomorrow from there to Yunta.  Saturday will see their arrival at Terowie and they will reach Burra on Sunday, where they are expected to arrive at about 12.15 p.m.  The barrows will carry a message from NSW Premier Neville Wran to SA Premier John Bannon to be received by Phil Tyler the new MLC for the seat of Fisher.  The barrows must contain a 30 kg load including a pick, a shovel, an axe, a bar of lead and miner’s provisions such as two blankets, two billies, water, flour, salt, tea, sugar and the essential two bottles of beer.  Their arrival in Burra will start the town’s Australia Day celebrations.  Paul O’Bryan’s country rock band will play in Market Square.  There will be a Tae-Kwon Do demonstration at 5.30 p.m. and then a barbecue by the creek.  Neil Andrew MP for Wakefield will present the Australia Day Awards.

Mr Rod Walsh, Burra’s new District Clerk began work on 9 January.  He was previously the CEO for DC of Dudley on Kangaroo Island.  He was born in Barmera and is a keen sportsman, being a past water ski champion for SA and is also a keen golfer and tennis player.  His wife, Lynne, has been active in kindergarten and pre0school affairs.  They have three children: Adele (4½), Erin (2) and Rory (7 months).

Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push

Committee member Chris Reed offers some thoughts on strategic considerations for competitors.

Hallett has an all day barbecue planned as part of the push.

The Dampier Salt Shakers are the favourites to win after winning the 1984 and 1985 Burra-Broken Hill races.  The Port Hedland team (formerly the Pilbarrow Pushers) are expected to offer them strong competition.  Other favoured contenders are the Daydream Team (Broken Hill) and the Burra Breathers.

The Broken Hill-Burra Barrow Push was won by the Dampier Salt Shakers from WA for the third time in succession.  A crowd estimated at 4,000 lined the highway and Burra streets to see the finish.  The Paringa Pushers came second.  The winners said their $10,000 prize would be donated to charity.  Paringa Pushers won $1,000 and in third place the Port Hedland Running Club won $500.  Retravision Boilers came 13th, but won $1,000 for being the only team with members over 40 years old.  Burra Barrow Birds won $1,000 for being the only female team.  Collinsville Rams were the best local team and came in fifth.  Burra Breathers came 8th.  The event was a great success and there are already plans for a Burra-Broken Hill push in 1988.

Citizen of the Year

Mrs Florence Scroop was named Citizen of the Year.  She has been involved with the Burra North Red Cross for over 40 years and has also been involved with the Aberdeen football, tennis and netball clubs.

For many years she has been head steward of the flower section at the Burra Show and has worked for Meals on Wheels and the Burra Hospital Committee.

[The article variously says Mrs Scroop was 75 years old and ’80-odd’, but as she was born in 1905 the figure of 80 was correct.]

Ian Kleinig was the Young Citizen of the Year.  In 1985 he was selected as a Queens Scout, the highest award in scouting.  His efforts have saved the Burra Cubs from collapse.  He is a steward in the Lutheran Church and a representative on the BCS Student Council as well as being involved in football, volleyball, tennis and swimming.

St Mary’s, Burra.  Repair work has begun and it is expected to be completed by 31 March.  A special recital by Adelaide organist John Hall is planned to mark the conclusion of the work.  Concrete pointing is being removed and replaced with lime mortar to eliminate dampness entering the church. Work will also be done on the parapets and capping and some new iron will be placed on the roof.

Gary Donaldson & his wife Jan set up Cousin Jack’s Art & Craft Gallery after touring SA looking for a suitable site about 15 months ago.  Gary is a wood turner whose pieces are a pleasant blend of the functional and the interpretive.  The gallery also has works by Peter Anderson, Rita Hall, Alison Cooper, Margaret Warwick and Martin Corbin among others.  [Photo of Gary Donaldson.]

Burra Barrow Push Team the Super Macs have challenged the Clare Crushers to try to beat them in the Mt Remarkable Sack Truck Race on 15 & 16 February for the prize of a carton of beer.  The race runs 84 km from Booleroo Centre to Pt Germein with a four member team to push a specially designed sack truck with a 40 kg load.

BCS.  The school is increasing the number of internally examined subjects and reducing the range of externally examined ones.    Principal Mr Roger Henderson said this would better suit students’ needs.  Internally examined Geography, Drama and two units of English will be offered and externally examined Geography and History will be dropped.  About 20 students were expected to take Year 12 this year; a slight fall in numbers.  95% of last year’s Year 12 students had either found employment or were doing tertiary study.  Internally examined History would have family history as a focus.

Staff changes:

In the Primary School Ms Helen Davis from Napperby Primary and Ms Karen Lockert from Teachers College will replace Mrs Wendy Burge and Ms Carolyn Bartlett.  The former has been in Burra for six years and is on accouchement leave, while the latter has moved to Pilgrim School at Aberfoyle Park.

In the Secondary School Mr James Harris is a new Adelaide University graduate to teach Physics and Drama teacher Mr John Keel has transferred from Eudunda Area School.  Ms Anna Kasoulus from Clare HS replaces Mr Colin Baker who goes to the position of Senior Master at East Murray Area School.  Ms Kasoulus will teach History and Geography.  After three years here teaching Physics and Computing Mr Garry Williams has transferred to Aberfoyle Park HS.

The Sharing and Caring Group’s program of meetings for the year is printed.

Mr Brian Ford is the new Hallett Primary School principal.  He comes from Cadell Primary School.

Burra Community Library.  BCS Principal Mr Roger Henderson said that plans were well advanced for a new mezzanine floor in the Library to house the local history collection.  It will be an internal steel structure that will not damage the walls of the old school building.  It is expected to cost about $21,000.  Funding is still being sorted out.

BCS.  The School is still awaiting a response to the proposal for a hostel.

Agricultural Bureaus at Hanson and Mt Bryan may merge in July.  Both have small memberships and will hold a joint program this year with alternate meetings at BCS and Mt Bryan.  A decision will be made in July.  Topics for the year’s program are listed.

Booborowie Primary School.  Mr & Mrs Barrey Niven have come from Tantanoola.  Barrey is the new principal who replaces Mr Leo Vasilunas, who moves to an advisory position with the District Office.  He will take the upper grades and his wife, Glenda, will reach reception to Year 3.  They have two children; Jacinta (6) and Adrienne (3).  Barrey plays the bagpipes and also enjoys tennis.  He hopes to join a hockey team too.  Glenda plays tennis and netball.

Burra CFS has bought a second hand UHF radio for its Bedford fire unit.  This follows a public appeal and $100 each from the Burra Apex, Lions and Yacht Clubs.  The unit will be very useful as 90% of local farmers had a UHF radio.

Advt.  There is quite a large advertisement for advance copies of Ian Auhl’s new book The Monster Mine – The Burra Burra Mine and its Townships 1845-1877.  Special offer 1 to 31 March of $32 plus $5 packaging and postage.  Recommended retail price after that will be $45 plus packaging and postage.

The Ian Auhl Collection is now open to the public.  The collection has been compiled by Mr Auhl over the last 20 years.  It includes an index of historical newspaper references, which he used in writing his book The Monster Mine.  There is also a biographical index of people mentioned in those references, together with collections of local maps, photos and negatives.  The Community Librarian, Mr Colin Fidock, said researchers could use the collection once they had filled out an application form, stating the purpose of their research.  He said it was hoped that the collection would eventually be located on the mezzanine floor of the library, though funding for that was still being negotiated.  The collection began when Mr Auhl was preparing a tourist pamphlet for the Burra DC and realised that the town had now newspaper of its own until 1876 and no history books about it except for centenary publications.  References to the town’s history could only be found in a collection of the Adelaide newspaper The Register, kept in the Burra Institute.  Mr Auhl began collecting the references to Burra from that source and miscellaneous references from other books.  The collection was used in the production of the Burra Sketchbook in 1969, which was illustrated by Maurice Perry.  It has since been used in preparing the Burra Conservation Study in 1978.  It has since been used in writing other historical accounts, in tourist pamphlets, for Council submissions and submissions for heritage listings.  Originally it had been intended to house the collection in the Copper Interpretive Centre, but when funding for this was diverted, it was decided to place it at the Burra Community Library.  Mr Auhl said there was still a century of Burra’s history to write, but he could not do it.  Burra’s future as one of Australia’s great historic towns depended on the depth and accuracy of its research he said.  He hoped that in the course of time the collection would ‘attract the commitment to its further use and growth in the course of the future of Burra and district.’

Market Square.  The revised plan for the redevelopment of the square has been completed and Council is now awaiting approval from the Department of Environment and Planning.  Changes had been made to the size and design of the traffic control mounds and to the type of materials used in the construction.  The changes follow an outcry at a public meeting last year.  A meeting last week involved the Burra Burra DC, the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning, the Chairman of the National Trust in Burra Mrs Maureen Wright and Mr Gerry O’Connor.  Mrs Wright said the plans were not very different from the original concept.  The Engineer had satisfied the Road Traffic Board and legal requirements, but had not taken into account heritage aspects.  A major problem was that there is a major highway through Burra and the lighting appropriate for a highway looked absolutely horrible in Market Square.  A final decision of lighting would have to be made within the next fortnight.  Mrs Wright said she hoped the final design would be publicly displayed.

Burra National Trust hopes owners of heritage buildings in Burra will consider placing enamel interpretive signs on them.  Signs with pictures and writing are planned for the buildings owned by the National Trust.  The Department of tourism and the Department of Mines may help with the Signposting Mrs Wright said.

SES Exercise.  Members of the Burra, Hallett, Pt Pirie and Laura SES units will combine in an exercise on March 9 at the disused honey factory about 4 km from Gladstone.  A mock explosion on the top floor will require crews to effect rescues after the collapse of normal access.

New Burra CFS/SES Headquarters are being planned at the old railway goods shed on Copperhouse Street.  They will share a radio room, training room, ablutions block and garage facilities, but will have separate storage rooms for equipment.  At present Burra CES had no permanent venue and was using the Town Hall for meetings and the storage of equipment.  The CFS was sharing the St John Ambulance Centre in Market Street.  The secretary of the CFS said this was adequate because the town had a fire brigade and the CFS only fought grass fires in summer and helped with serious town fires.  Locating the CFS and SES near each other would allow them to combine resources.

Burra SES has taken delivery of their replacement light rescue vehicle.  It is a second hand 4WD Toyota troop carrier, which is able to transport seven crew and their equipment as well as to tow a trailer.  Of the $6,300 cost, half was paid by the Burra Burra DC and half by an SES subsidy.  It replaces a 10-year-old Land Cruiser, which had extensive rust and other problems.

Burra Copper Festival planning is under way.  A feature of the weekend will be a production at Redruth Gaol by the Arts Council, the National Trust and Flinders University drama students.  One idea is for country music and bonfires along the creek.  A committee has been formed to organise an arts and draft exhibition.  A bullockies’ breakfast is being contemplated to start the Gulf Road re-enactment, which will be started by Kym Bonython.  Bullock drays, horses and mule teams will take part in the trek to Pt Wakefield, leaving Burra 13 October and due in Pt Wakefield on 1 November to greet the Jubilee 150 ketch Falie, which is to take the copper ore to Pt Adelaide.  The route passes through Farrell Flat, Mintaro, Leasingham, Auburn, Hoyleton, Halbury, and Balaklava.

Halley’s Comet sparked a letter from the ‘Bible Christian Church’ at Burra, drawing a parallel between the gradual decay of the comet and the moral decay of the nation.

Burra Apex Club will hold its annual Ploughman’s Dinner this Saturday night in the Town Hall.  At the end of June 1986 it looked as if the club might fold because of loss of members.  There were then only six active members, but since then numbers had grown until there were now 19 active members.

The Burra to Clare Barrow Push will be held on Easter Sunday.  The competitors will push a load of 35 kg for a first prize of $400, with runners-up to get $200 and third place $100.  There will be two sections.  The senior teams will cover the 42 km to Clare from Burra, while a junior section will start from Farrell Flat and cover 21 km.  The winning junior team stands to win $150, with $50 to the runners-up.

The Bon Accord Museum is to be opened on the October long weekend and work on it is progressing well.  About $30,000 has been spent and a display case to house the model of the mine in 1860 by Mrs Pam Marlow is currently being installed.  The National Trust has provided the $5,000 for the case, which was designed by Mr Peter Stitt from Moonta.  Mrs Marlow now lives in Pinnaroo, but will return to the Bon Accord in the May school holidays to build the hills and landscape for the model.  Chairman of the National Trust Mrs Maureen Wright, said they were seeking old telephone books because their paper made excellent papier mâché.   Once the landscape has been completed the 33 groups of model buildings will be installed in time for the October opening.  The museum will also contain a social history of the Burra Burra and Princess Royal Mines.  The original shaft of the Bon Accord Mine has been covered with a glass viewing panel and a safety tail has been installed, so that visitors can now look down the 20 m shaft.  Work was also being done at the original police station and lock-up.  This has been financed by a grant of $12,000 from the National Estate and $3,000 from the National Trust.  Local stone mason, Daryl Pearce, and plasterer, Peter Bailey, have been working on the site.  They were currently building a dome-shaped roof on the old toilet.

New Aged Housing for Burra

The six McBride stone cottages in Chapel Street may be redeveloped for aged housing in a joint venture between the Burra Burra DC and the Housing Trust.  The project has been submitted to the Housing Trust for costing and if successful work will be gin in May.  District Clerk Me R. Walsh said the cottages would be remodelled as one-bedroom units with new kitchens, bathrooms and laundries.  Each is currently built on two levels, but the proposal is to build up the back to make a one level unit that is more convenient for elderly people.  New Picket fences will be erected at the front and a colorbond fence at the rear.  Two of the existing tenants would remain and there are already applications from interested parties for the other four.  Rents will be means-tested.  If approved the Burra homes would become part of the SA Jubilee 150 Cottages for the Aged project.  The former Premier Mr Tonkin had set the Trust the goal of providing 1,000 homes for the aged by the end of the Jubilee year.  They would probably exceed it said co-ordinator of the Joint Venture section of the Housing Trust, Mr L. Rentis.  The majority of them had been built in the country.

Old Bible Christian Chapel.  Work has started on the re-development of the old Bible Christian Chapel and block on the corner of Kingston St and Paxton Terrace [sic: actually Bridge Terrace].  The chapel will be renovated and a new building, similar to the Cottages in Paxton Square will be erected next to it.  The timber-framed building will be finished in a rendered stone wall finish to blend in with Paxton Square, as recommended by the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning.  It is intended the buildings will house a museum outlining the history of Paxton Square and will become the second tourist office in Burra.  The Burra Burra DC will provide $80,000 for the project and the Lewis Trust the remaining $40,000*.  The wooden framework for the new building was erected last week.

Estelle Nicholls of Burra won the North Eastern Women’s Bowling Association’s Champion of Champions title in the singles final at Peterborough on 14 March.  Jamestown won the Fours.

The Redbanks Recreation Study should be given to the Burra Burra DC in the next fortnight.  It will suggest which part of the 25 acre area should be used for the different types of recreation.  Erosion was a problem in the area and it is likely that scrambling and camping would be restricted to certain parts of the area.

Burra Burra DC will investigate the possibility of buying land in Burra North as a parking space for heavy transports carrying stock.  Local carrier Mr A. McBride suggested to idea.  Acting District Clerk, Mr R. Walsh, said the idea had the merit of keeping the vehicles off the town streets, increasing their safety and reducing the parking problem.  Council would discuss the matter with the stock firms who owned the land in question.

The Council will also establish a Heritage Advisory Sub-Committee to advise and make recommendations to Council on heritage matters in the district.  Crs H. Stockman, J.W. Barton and G. Radford will be Council representatives and Chairman J. Hawker will be an ex-officio member.  The formation of the sub-committee follows increasing development of sites such as Redruth Gaol, Paxton Square Cottages, the mine area and problems with the redevelopment of Market Square.  At the February meeting of Council Cr H. Stockman suggested the District Clerk and District Engineer visit the historic mining town of Maldon in Victoria to report on its heritage and development.  They will visit Maldon in April.

Council will support applications for grants from the Department of Local Government:

Burra Promotions Committee $2,700 for signage at each end of the township

Caring and Sharing Group

Burra Community Library $2,500 for the student family history project

Community News $3,800 to assist with the fortnightly booklet.

Council will hold immunisation clinics for local students following urging from the SA Health Commission.  They will cover diseases like polio and tetanus.

Market Square.  The meeting between Councillors and representatives of the National Trust resulted in a decision to install post-top lights.  The design looks like an inverted bowler hat.  They will replace the nine-and-a-half metre high gooseneck installed last October.  Trust Chairman Mrs M. Wright said they would harmonise better with the heritage environment and the cost was in line with the original costing for gooseneck poles.  The Council recently adopted its revised plan for the square.  The changes mainly affected the protuberances in the road and at its margins.  The surface of the main pedestrian area was kept 12 cm below the top of the existing kerb to retain the curvature of the kerb line.  Work was expected to begin shortly.

John William Barton, local Burra chemist, became an Australian citizen at February’s Council meeting and was presented with a native eucalyptus tree.  Cr Barton migrated to Australia with his parents 31 years ago when his father became managing director of David Brown Tractors in Sydney.  The family later moved to Adelaide.  He decided to become a citizen after experiencing the customary delays in getting a British passport for an overseas trip.

The Adelaide Botanic Gardens have asked to borrow the Jubilee Fountain in Market Square in order to make a replica for the Adelaide Gardens.  The loan has been agreed to by the Council and the National Trust.

Burra Town Rates are likely to rise this year.  District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said the rural rates were subsidising the townships of Burra, Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat and were excessive in proportion to the town rates.  The Council will petition the Minister for Local Government in October to change the rating system from one based on land value to one based on capital value.  [That is from unimproved vales to improved values, which would have the effect of an increase in town rates.]

Council Amalgamations.  There will be discussions between representatives of the Burra Burra DC and Wakefield Plains DC on 1 April to consider advantages and disadvantages of council amalgamations.  District Clerk R. Walsh said that although there were no plans to amalgamate with Wakefield Plains, future amalgamation with Hallett, Spalding or Robertstown was a possibility.  The meeting was to see how the amalgamation between Port Wakefield, Balaklava and Owen, which occurred some three years ago, had succeeded.

Market Square.  A group of 45 residents gathered in Market Square yesterday morning to blockade the start of redevelopment work by the Burra Burra DC.  The redevelopment has been controversial since last year when the Council announced new lighting proposals and alternative road route to increase safety.  The protest started at 6 a.m. when Council workers moved in the remove concrete kerbing around the rotunda and the median strip in Market Square.  According to several protesters several incidents occurred before workers took a tea break at 8.45 a.m.  They had not returned to work by noon.  One incident involved Mr Bill Keane, a farmer from Gum Creek and Mr Tom Boulger, a shop owner.  The pair ended up standing in the bucket of a loader that was removing kerbing opposite the rotunda.  They were forced to jump off.  Another protester was Mrs Eunice Baker, who was strongly opposed to the Council’s actions, saying they had ignored ratepayers’ feelings.  She said the Chairman had gone to the Clare Sheep Show and left the newly appointed District Clerk to face the protesters.  She was also unhappy with the National Trust for making a compromise with the Council.  Tourist Information Officer Jenny O’Connor hoped more residents would support the move against the changes to the square.  The square was listed as number six in importance on the National Estate, she said, and the Council had no tight to modernise it.  People were generally rather apathetic, but she thought this issue might galvanize them into action.  Mr Derek Rayfield, Secretary of the Burra Preservation Organisation said the demonstration was spontaneous. The Organisation had collected 819 signatures from 1,471 ratepayers in just a week.

By noon most protesters had left the scene and the Council Chairman Mr James Hawker had returned from Clare.  He said at this stage the Council had no plans to change its mind unless new information was presented to it.  Some of the allegations about changes to the rose garden and the War Memorial were wrong, he said.  He had received no official request for a poll.  In December electors had asked them to seek professional advice and they had done that.  Council had not seen the petition circulated by the Burra Preservation Organisation, but he believed it showed that Queen Street had been closed off, which was a ‘blatant inaccuracy’.

Burra Police reported a major accident at the scramble track at Redbanks over Easter.  At least four riders had been injured.  The major difficulty in that area had been enforcing a fire ban, as many campers had not come equipped to cope with that eventuality.

69, 9, 4 April 1986, page 5

Market Square Issues

A newsletter designed to clear up some misconceptions about Market Square plans has been distributed to Burra residents.  Council chairman Mr James Hawker said that despite public meetings in July and December to explain details, it was clear that misconceptions persisted.  There was a petition going around with a map that was completely incorrect.  As it transpired people did realise that and altered it.  He said that although there had been no major accidents recently in the square, the number of tourists in the town had doubled in five years.  The current position will not be the same in the future.  The parking situation in Burra is undesirable; there is no formal parking and no lines.  People park where they want.  They park near corners and around the triangular island in the square; reversing blindly from the kerb.  There had been three previous plans to change the arrangements in the square, but none had been enacted.  The current plan was the first that had taken account of engineering principles such as traffic management and drainage.  He noted the Burra Preservation Organisation had accepted the mew lighting proposals.

Morphett’s Pump-house.  Work will begin at this site this month on the $100,000 re-development.  District Clerk Mr Walsh said that the work would make the pump-house and the Bon Accord museum one of the state’s top tourist attractions.  Work on restoring the shaft was one of a number of SA projects that has received funding during the Jubilee 150 year.  The pump-house project and the Bon Accord Museum will be officially opened during the Copper-town Festival in October.

Burra Town Hall has a new management committee.  At a public meeting on 5 March Mr Barry Wright was elected president with Mr David Thamm as Secretary and Mrs Freda Pink as Publicity Officer.  Cr Norm Maxted is the Council representative.  New boards have been installed in the stage floor.  Burra Apex Club has offered to re-polish the main floor and has also requested the telephone be relocated to the ticket bay in the foyer and other minor repairs be effected.  District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said the Town Hall usage had changed recently as young adults now seem to prefer pubs for their entertainment.

The City of Temple in Texas has been suggested as Burra’s new twin town for the Jubilee 150 year.  The original proposal to be twinned with Kerrville in Texas had fallen through due to a lack of response from Kerrville.  Temple, with a population of 45,000, was known for its research hospitals.

Work on the Burra-Spalding Road has begun, using an emergency grant of $100,000.

Burra Burra DC has applied for a $1,500 subsidy to buy the land in the creek bed on the southern outskirts of Burra adjacent to Kotz’s Estate.  If successful the land would be a public park and Council would plant trees there to beautify the area.

The Council’s Supplementary Development Plan now seems unlikely to be available to the public until August or September.

Council representatives will meet with the Caravan Park Sub-Committee on 4 April to consider the future of the park and possible alternative sites for it.  It was desirable that the present park be closed because of its location and the small number of sites available there.  They will consider available sites around the town able to accommodate 60-80 caravans.

Paxton Square

E.T. Baulderstone writes as Treasurer of the Lewis Board of Management.

The following is an outline of the management, finance, etc. of the Paxton Square Cottages Project.

Most people are aware that the cottages contribute to the history of SA and Australia.

I have been connected with their management for the past 20 years and wish to bring the correct facts to the notice of the grumblers who insist their rates are spent financing these cottages.

About four years ago the cottages were transferred to the Burra Burra DC gratis, the main reason being that the Council was in a position to receive grants, etc. for their development.

During the last three years approximately $500,000 has been made available in grants etc.

The Council appointed a management board to manage these grants and arranged for a loan of $100,000 for the first stage, which opened in April 1983 as holiday cottages.

18 months later the second stage was opened.

Since being in operation, the board has paid all loan repayments, amounting to over $65,000 and capital expenditure $42,000, in addition to the maintenance and operating costs.

We are now in a position to contribute $40,000 towards the third stage with a cost of $120,000.

The Council has arranged for a loan of $80,000 for the balance, which will be repaid from our profits and will cost the ratepayers nothing, while making the property more valuable.

A complete financial statement is rendered at each monthly meeting of the board and a copy is forwarded to Council.

A yearly statement is presented at the annual public meeting attended by very few ratepayers.

‘Stop grumbling and uttering false statements among the people of our community.  I am available at most times to answer queries in a sensible manner.’

Market Square

D. Rayfield said: ‘The historic nature of Market Square is no more.’ after seeing the square earlier on Tuesday.  Work had recommenced on the Square on Friday morning following Thursday’s confrontation between protesters and council workers.  About 30 protesters were there again, but additional police had been brought in from Pt Pirie, Spalding, Hallett and Pt Augusta.  Police removed a bus that had been parked on the disputed Median strip and a tractor also illegally parked to disrupt work.  The protesters staged a passive protest.  Mr Rayfield described Friday as disastrous.  He had hoped that unofficial talks between the parties involved might take place earlier this week, but that had not occurred.

David Kellock of Kelvale, Burra, bred this year’s Clare Sheep Show’s Grand Champion Poll Merino Ram.

Burra Burra DC held ratepayers’ meetings at Mt Bryan & Booborowie last week.  Issues discussed included the current financial situation, future financial strategies, ratings policy, Market Square and future projects.  Many of the Council borrowings were self servicing loans taken out by organisations like the Lewis Trust or sporting clubs, or loans taken out by previous councils for capital works.  District Clerk Mr Walsh said the overall deficit for 1985-86 would be $86,500, which was not much different from last year.  The main factors in an increase were the cut in road funding and the rural recession.  Mr Hawker said the proposed Burra North by-pass was not a Council sponsored project, but had been proposed by the Highways Department.  The Black Bridge at Burra North had a weight limit of 20 tonnes and could not be upgraded.  There was as yet no starting date for the Highways Department project.

During the meeting plans were tabled for the proposed redevelopment of the Morphett’s boiler-house.  Council was seeking Australian Bicentennial Funding for this project.  The plans would preserve existing walls and restore the roofline to create a space to house copper and mining history.

Consultants were in the last stages of developing the Supplementary development Plan for the Council.

Council would also be seeking ratepayers’ ideas on ward boundaries because new legislation limited the variation in the number of electors each councillor could represent to 10%.  Currently Burra had four town councillors representing about half the electorate and seven rural representatives from the other half.  This imbalance will have to be addressed.

A total of about 150 electors attended the meetings.

BCS won the interschool secondary sports day for the sixth year in a row last week.  Competing schools were Burra, Riverton, Kapunda and Eudunda.  Mr Brian Chapman, Director of the SA Volleyball Association presented the Mid North Athletics Championship Shield to Burra and the Improvement Shield to Riverton.

[Highlights of the results are printed.]

Burra Lifesaving Club celebrated the successes of Mid North Life-Savers at a conference at Hallett over the weekend.  This year saw the presentation of distinctions in lifesaving to six Mid North lifesavers.  About 200 attended the conference at Tooralie.  On Saturday there was training for the cardio-pulmonary certificate and in the evening they were entertained by Paul O’Brian’s Country & Western Band.  On Sunday morning the conference was visited by the Secretary of the Royal Lifesaving Society of SA Mr Vin Forde, who declared the Burra Royal Lifesaving Society an official club with office bearers.  Elected: President, Mrs Pohlner and Mrs Jan Jacka, Secretary-Treasurer.  There was a bush picnic on Sunday afternoon and a trip of the Tooralie Hills.  The Burra Club has been running for four years.  [Various awards are listed.]

A Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting on Thursday last at the Burra Civic Centre was attended by about 100 people.

Chairman J. Hawker said the Council’s financial position was well within accepted levels, but would require careful watching.  The loan situation was about average compared with other councils.  The Secretary General of the Local Government Association Mr J. Hullick affirmed these statements.  Loans of 26 or 27% of the rate revenue are very much the state average, he said.  Mr Hawker said he would like to change the Council’s rating system in 1987-88.  A significant proportion of Burra is on the minimum rate.  The rural area is subsidising the town area.  As the Local Government Act required a change to ward boundaries to more equal representation of electors, so too should there be an equalising of rates, he said.  Mr Baker suggested that the proposed changes would result in people allowing their property to run down.  Mr McGuiness raised the issue of rural roads.  Mr Hawker said there were problems with rural roads, but some roads had to get priority, not just bits and pieces.  Mr Tebbett said he could not see how this situation would improve with less money spent on roads in 1985-86 compared with 1984-85.  Mr Hawker said this reflected Government policy.  The State has said it will not give out anything for rural arterial roads next year.  The Councillors have tried very hard to get outside money, but Mr Hawker said he was very apprehensive about the forthcoming financial situation.  Mrs Dewhirst questioned whether the Supplementary Development Plan would continue to be an obstacle to installing tiled roofs in the town.  Mrs Baker said they were moving towards a socialist society and thought it frightening.  She saw the examples of Market Square, the supplementary Development Plan and the proposed rating changes as an erosion of the public voice in a democratic country.  Mr Hawker said that electors could call for a poll before any change to the rating system was introduced.  Mrs Dewhirst was concerned about the amount of unauthorised development in the town and wondered whether the Supplementary Development Plan would be as laxly enforced.  Mr Hawker said those who did not act within the law would ultimately face litigation.  Mrs Tennant asked whether the Council was aware of the petition against the Market Square redevelopment.  Mr Hawker said he had been informed it was circulating, but that it was addressed to the Minister for Local Government and the petition was never lodged with the Council.  Mr Denton said many people had signed it because they were concerned by the level of Council debt and thought that by stopping Market Square they would ease the financial position.  Mr Hawker said that as Chairman he ultimately accepted what happened in Council.  He thought it was time to bury the controversy.  Former Mayor Mr Ted Baulderstone also called for reconciliation.  He revived the tradition of calling for a vote of thanks to the Council at the end of the meeting.  He said it was difficult in Council to do what people want all the time.  He hoped the perturbing split in the town over the past few weeks could be healed.  The meeting ended with applause.

The Gulf Road Re-enactment will begin in Burra on 13 October.  Bullocky, Mr Jim Kelly and his team will cart copper ore from Burra to Pt Wakefield over the historic 96 km route.  The teams will leave Burra at 10 a.m. after a Bullockies Breakfast on the banks of the creek.  They will be seen off by Mr Kym Bonython the Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee.  The plan is to travel about 5 km a day and to pass through Hanson, Farrell Flat, Mintaro, Leasingham, Auburn, Hoyleton, Halbury, Balaklava and Pt Wakefield.  The route was pioneered between 1849 and 1857 as an attempt to reduce the cost of transporting ore by bullock the 160 km to Pt Adelaide, where it was shipped as ballast on wool ships sailing to Wales.

Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push.  Plans have been laid for the push on 13-17 January rather than the Australia Day long weekend.  Mr Chris Reed, one of the organisers, said they thought there would be too much going on at that date.  The committee is aiming to boost the prize money to $30,000.  If they are successful in getting sponsorship the first prize will be $10,000, with $3,000 for second and $2,000 for third.  There will also be a fourth prize of $1,000 and $500 for fifth.  $1,000 prizes will also be awards to the winning over-40 team, the service team, the all-female team and the under-17 team.  Second in each category will get $500.  An allocation of $5,000 for fun-runners has yet to be determined.  Mr Reed said the aim was to tie the event into the opening of the Broken Hill Mining Museum and the Burra Copper Interpretive Centre in the Bicentennial event.

[Other details are given.]

The Jubilee Trade Train will visit next week.

The Burra National Trust will hold their first bus tour on 10 May.  They will visit Clare and its National Trust Museum, the historic Wolta Wolta home and Medika Gallery in Blyth.

Ruth Trevivian of Adelaide writes to the Editor.

As one who was born in Burra 70 years ago I watched the TV with incredulity and sickness the desecration of Market Square.  One of my first memories was being taken to the Square to see snow which had fallen through the night.  I walked through Market Square daily to get to school and loved the sweeping curve of the street.  I was interstate when the planned changes were given publicity and so could not register my indignation.  Now I wish to say I think it monstrous that it should be altered.  I don’t recall there being accidents there, but if there were, I consider it due not to the layout of the streets, but to the condition or inexperience of the drivers.  Why the need to tamper with this lovely setting?  [The letter continues in this vein.]

The Jubilee Trade Train was in Burra 4 & 5 May.  On Sunday about 1,000 people visited it and enjoyed the festive atmosphere.  Many dressed in period costume.  A prize for best dressed went to Mrs Margaret Lehmann and her granddaughter Jane of Mt Bryan.  A variety of stalls complemented the train displays.

Drama at Redruth Gaol

A feature of the Copper festival will be a drama at Redruth Gaol.  It will bring to life the old days of the gaol and reformatory and will be staged 11 & 12 October, with a special schools presentation on 10 October.  It will cost $20,000 and will be exciting and challenging.  Drama students from Flinders University have been researching the mining, church, pastoralists, pastimes, education and architecture of early Burra.  Twenty residents have already provided oral histories of the gaol and what they can remember of its folklore.  There will also be a serious study of the nature of crime in this area in the nineteenth century.  The differences between life in the gaol and the reformatory will be explained.  Parts of the performance may involve folk dancing, bush and choral music, pyrotechnics, giant puppets, kites, readings and re-enactments, film, video and street pageants as well as more conventional scripted theatre.  The aim is to celebrate and record links with the town’s past.  The audience is likely to move through different parts of the gaol as the performance goes on.  As well as the drama students, the performance is being organised by the Burra branches of the Arts Council, the Copper Festival Committee, the National Trust and Senior Citizens as well as involving the District Council and the school.

Mid North Regional Tourism Awards.

Mrs Jenny O’Connor won the award for outstanding achievement in tourist promotion for the second year in a row.

O’Connor, Tours run by Jenny & Denny O’Connor won the award for best tourist services in the region.

The awards were presented by the Shadow Minister of Tourism, Mrs Jennifer Adamson.

Accident.  A Tarago van rolled over in Paradise Street on 5 May.  Damage to the van was estimated at $4,000.  There were five occupants from NSW and one was treated at Burra hospital for minor injuries.

Accident.  A car rolled over 12 km south of Burra on the Barrier Highway on 11 May, injuring two elderly people from Adelaide.  They were treated for minor injuries at Burra Hospital.

The Simpson Family held a reunion at the Burra Town Hall on 6 April. It was organised by Mrs Daphne Cook and Mrs Dawn Dawes.  Five generations of the family attended.  About 100 people were present.  The first Simpsons were farmers in the district in the 1870s.  A previous reunion had been held in 1982.  Most of the visitors wore period costume.

Governor Sir Donald Dunstan & Lady Dunstan will attend the Burra Civic Ball in the Town Hall on 7 June.  Queen’s Scouts and Venturers led by Mr David Jennings will form a guard of honour.  The Dance Victoriana Troupe will demonstrate old time dances and Morey Paley’s Dance Orchestra from Adelaide will provide the music.  Research is being done into a suitable décor and Barry Wright of the Town Hall Committee said they were considering removing the panels from the turned wood balustrades.  This had been placed there to prevent young picture show patrons from rolling bottles and other objects onto the audience below.  The gallery would accommodate about 50 non-dancers for the evening.

Accident.  A semi-trailer rolled over about 2 km north of Mt Bryan at 3.30 p.m. on 8 May.  SES and St John’s Ambulance freed the trapped driver after about an hour’s effort.  The vehicle was transporting cattle, about 30 of which had to be destroyed by police and stock agents at the scene.

Redruth Gaol has won a $50,000 grant from the Commonwealth Banking Organisation for renovations.  President of the Burra National Trust, Maureen Wright, said they were delighted.  Work to be done includes salt damp treatment, repair of stonework, re-capping, plastering, painting and re-pointing.   Some interpretive displays would also be financed.  The car park would be upgraded and a toilet block erected.  This would enable the facility to be hired out for functions.  The gaol would be the venue for the Redruth drama event during the Copper Festival in October.  When the Trust acquired the building in 1977 the cost of restoration was estimated at $80,000.  The Trust had so far spent about $31,000.  It was worthwhile as the Gaol now attracted about 30,000 visitors per year.  The money is a bicentennial grant and so work would probably not start till 1987.

Bon Accord Museum

Although the Jubilee 150 grant of $30,000 had been spent, there was still much work to be done at the Bon Accord buildings and grounds.  Over three days recently members of the National Trust held a successful working bee to help with the project.  Moonta artist Mr Peter Stitt is arranging the displays.  Curator of the National Trust and local librarian Colin Fidock is preparing interpretive information.  Former Burra teacher Mrs Pam Marlow is completing her model of the 1860 view of the Burra Burra Mine.  Over the weekend the interior of the corrugated iron shed which houses the mine shaft was painted.  This shaft has recently been cleaned and illuminated.  The interior of the stone building will also be painted in time for the official opening of the museum on the October long weekend.

Burra Burra DC had lodged a protest about the size of the 1986-87 road grant.  The Council had received a 3.2% increase to $63,000 compared with $61,000 last year.  They had requested a 10% increase.

Accident.  A car rolled over near Robertstown on Saturday night on the Black Springs-Robertstown Road.  The Holden sedan was a write-off.  Robert Gregory Kilmartin (27) of Salisbury was admitted to the Burra Hospital with a broken arm and an ear injury, but was later released.  Passenger, Philip Andrew White of Smithfield Plains was uninjured.

BCS.  The historic Kooringa Building has undergone a facelift.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said most of the work was finished in April with some finishing touches in the May school holidays.  About $90,000 was spent replacing stone affected by salt damp.  Concrete rendering was replaced, the rood refastened and the exterior was repainted in accordance with the original colour scheme; the roof is red, the timber window frames are bottle green and the horizontal concrete bands are a fawn colour.  The brickwork was re-pointed.  Work will now begin on the interior, including the construction of a mezzanine floor to house the local history collection.  Curtains and blinds worth $1,100 have recently been installed in the western end of the building to help reduce summer heat.  These have been paid for by the school’s fund-raising committee, which has raised more than $2,000 this year for improvements.  $350 of gardening equipment has also been purchased along with technical drawing equipment, photographic enlarger, a drum kit and extra guitars.

BCS is busy rehearsing for performances of Man of Steel, which will be presented early in term III.  The school will host language students from Athol Park Language Centre between 30 June and 4 July.  This will be the third time the school has hosted the students who will be billeted with town families.  Some of the students, whose ages range from 12 to 22, were refugees.  A careers counselling seminar in Adelaide has been arranged for later in the term.  40 Burra students from Years 10, 11 & 12 will join students from Clare, Riverton and Balaklava for the excursion, which includes a visit to Technology Park.

The school hopes to launch its Jubilee 150 book Relatively Speaking during the Copper Festival in October.  Principal Mr Roger Henderson said the school was seeking a sponsor to pay the $13,000 it will need to produce 1,000 copies of the book.  The book is in the final stages of preparation.  About 690 contributors from students at Burra Community School, and from Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Hallett Schools have prepared work for it.  Entries are either historical memories of families or contemporary observations, which will be of future historic interest.  Information is listed alphabetically by family and includes photographs.  Louisa Fidock of BCS has won the competition to design the cover.

Miss M.E. Lang became an Australian citizen at a ceremony at the Burra Burra DC’s May meeting.

Heritage Adviser

At the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC a visiting officer with the State Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment & Planning, Mr Jon Womersley, suggested that Burra appoint an expert heritage adviser.  The Council recently proposed to for a Heritage Committee.  Mr Womersley said a professional expert might prove more useful, as committees did not usually cone to unanimous decisions, leaving the Council in the same sort of dilemma that they had recently faced over the changes to Market Square.  An adviser could assess and integrate community ideas, could advise Council directly on heritage matters and could help inform citizens on what conservation needed to be done and how that could be achieved.  If Burra currently had 30,000 visitors this could be 100,000 by 1996.  He said an adviser could be appointed for two years and a grant would probably be available for two-thirds of his or her salary.  He said that part of the problem with Market Square was that a series of people did not understand all the implications.  ‘More discussions earlier in the piece would have been better.’

Cr Kellock thought that the committee would get a cross-section of views, whereas an adviser was back to a single opinion.  Cr Woolley thought that even with two-thirds of the salary coming from a grant they would have to find some $8,000, which was a concern.  The Chairman said the idea was a new concept and needed a lot more thought before any action was taken.

‘He asked that Mr Womersley’s staff prepare a report into the proposal for the July meeting of council so council would have the option of calling a public meeting before grant applications were due.

Burra Civic Ball

About 180 people attended the Civic Ball in the Town Hall on Saturday evening.  Nearly all were in period costume.  The Town Hall was transformed for the event.  A flood-lit portrait of Queen Victoria was flanked by an Australian Flag and a Union Jack.  Pre-ball parties were held and local teacher Mr Roger Boehm borrowed a trap from the National Trust to take some guests to the event.  Burra Queen Scouts and Venturers dressed in red uniforms of the early colonial soldiers to for a guard of honour.  Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr James Hawker called on those present to pause and reflect on their ancestry in honour of the Jubilee.  Later in the evening the Governor of SA, Sir Donald Dunstan, arrived from Adelaide to officially open the ball.  He remarked that his great-great grandfather had walked to Burra in 1847 and later the Dunstan family had lived in one of the miner’s dugouts in the Burra Creek for a short time.  Later he cut the Jubilee cake (made by Mrs Penny Hawker) with his sword.  The Vice-Regal couple danced to 60/40 music provided by Morey Paley’s Dance Orchestra from Adelaide.  Dance Victoriana Troupe provided demonstration dances.  Among spectators was the Australia Day Citizen of the Year, Mrs Florence Scroop.  Claire Hawker presented Lady Dunstan with a posy, which, when she left, Lady Dunstan asked be given to Mrs Scroop.  This was the first civic ball in Burra for many years and had been organised by Cr Helen Stockman, the wives of Councillors and representatives from the National Trust.

‘American’ Plan Proposed for Burra’s Main Street

Recently the Shadow Minister for the Arts suggested that the American ‘Main Street’ program would be suitable for Burra.  On a visit to Adelaide recently the President of the American Institute of Architects, Ms Mary Means, held a seminar about this concept.  It aims at gaining wider community support for heritage conservation while developing the centre into a tourist and commercial centre.  In the plan a trained advisor would use the skills of professionals to help local traders and shop owners to develop a unique heritage image for the shopping centre, which would make the most of existing heritage buildings.  Programs would aim to promote the whole street rather than individual shops.  A trust could be established to preserve the heritage buildings and simultaneously to develop the commercial and tourist potential of the street.  The trust would use the existing conservation studies as well as taking advice from historians, heritage advisers and architects.  It would seek to make agreements with owners of buildings so that no unsightly or unauthorised alterations or developments took place.  The cost of such a project would initially be about $20,000 p.a. for which corporate or government sponsorship could be sought.  One or two shops per year could be restored so that there would be no dramatic change.  ‘Polly’s Teashop’ in the former Record office is an example of this type of preservation.  A revitalisation of Market Square would exploit and boost tourist trade.

The article was tabled at the June meeting of the Burra Burra DC, which was attended by the Head of the State Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment & Planning, Mr Jon Womersley.  He said the program had generally been introduced into towns with populations larger than 50,000.  He was asked what Ms Means thought about other heritage areas around the state.  He said she believed Pt Adelaide redevelopment was ‘sterile’ and Hahndorf was ‘kitsch’.

Mr Hawker said that in the end heritage would have to pay its way.  ‘But if the heritage character was destroyed by unwise activity the town would just become a handful of historical sites which was the case with Hahndorf, he said.’

Burra Traders Association would invite an expert from Adelaide to discuss the idea.  Cr Barton said the response of traders would most likely depend on what funding arrangements could be developed.

The Council has written to the Association expressing concern about the poor condition of some of the businesses and commercial premises in Burra.

Burra Community Library

Historic furniture will be a feature of the local and SA history collection to be housed in the new mezzanine floor of the library.  Librarian Mr Colin Fidock said the new floor would be added in the BCS book storage and resource room, which has a very high ceiling.  It would add about 9 square metres of floor space and feature an elegant wooden balustrade.  Much of the material used in Mr Ian Auhl’s research will be housed in a cedar cupboard from the original DC office.  There is also an old headmaster’s desk, which will be used as a newspaper reading desk.  Some original shelving from the Institute Library will be used to house the collection.  Tables will be made from original mine timbers.  It was hoped work on the mezzanine would start next month.

Redbanks

A 150 ha site in Redbanks Reserve has been earmarked as SA’s first fully-managed off-road recreational vehicle area for a two year trial period, following a study by the Department of Environment & Planning.  Recreation & Sports Minister Mr Kym Mayes announced this last week.  If the experiment is successful it would lead to a network of ORRV reserves across the state.  The 150 ha area is part of the 1,000 ha Redbanks Reserve.  It will be leased to the Burra Burra DC, which will set up a committee to manage ORRV activity at the site.  This particular part of the reserve does not contain features of environmental significance.  Public submissions on the proposal should be sent to Mr Ian Trestrail of the Department of Recreation & Sport.

Burra Lions Club held its annual handover dinner at the Sports Complex on Saturday.  Incoming President Robin Eberhard farewelled the outgoing President Sergeant John Reed, who is leaving the town for Coober Pedy on 7 July.  John Maidment proposed a toast to Sergeant Reed who has been in Burra for five years.  He had joined the Police at the age of 17 in his home town of Leigh Creek and in 1961, 17 years to the day, he returned to work there.  Mrs Reed will also be missed, having been active in sport, the BCS Council and the Anglican Church.  Their eldest child, Peter, will stay in Burra to complete his education and will continue to play football for the Rams B-grade team.  Daughter Kylie (13) and Vicky (10) leave with their parents next month.

Burra Burra DC will investigate the availability of funding to quarry bluestone for kerbing and the employment of two stone masons to cut the rock.  It is thought that funds might be obtained either through the Commonwealth Employment Program or from the Heritage Branch of the Department of Heritage & Planning.

The Burra Preservation Organisation discussed the possible removal of Victorian letter boxes from the town and the Burra North by-pass at their meeting on Thursday last.  About 35 people attended.  In response to a request from the Burra Burra DC it was resolved to send them a copy of the petition objecting to the Market Square redevelopment, which had been sent to the Local Government Minister.

They said this would show the Council that 55% of ratepayers opposed the redevelopment.

They were also concerned that the Council condoned the Highway Department’s proposal closing part of Morehead Street between the Redruth Camping Centre and the main road and the deviation of Ludgvan St in a northwest direction.  This is to prevent traffic from using the Black Street Bridge [sic: for the Black Bridge], which is unable to cope with the weight.  Mr Rayfield said the Highways Department had said the bridge was at the end of its life and couldn’t cope with trucks weighing 60-70 tonnes crossing it illegally.  The organisation proposed reinforcing the bridge because the proposal would cut the town in half and destroy heritage items.

The deviation would destroy a disused croquet court and shed.  They were also concerned about the deviation having metre high embankments, which could be the site of an accident.  The deviation would also direct tourists away from the town.

The Post Office proposed to remove two of the three remaining cast iron Victorian letter boxes in the town because they are little used.  The boxes in questions are in Kingston Street and near the Hospital.  The organisation would prefer that the boxes be closed, but remain in position.

Sheep theft.  Police are investigation the theft of about 320 ewes worth a total of $3,200 from Grassville Station east of Burra between last December and May 1986.

Golf.  About 176 women golfers will converge on Burra from around the state next week for the Bronze Salver Golf Tournament.  Members will come from 44 different clubs.  Players with lower handicaps will compete in the Silver Salver Tournament at Moonta and the Gold Salver Tournament at Pt Augusta.

The Troupe Theatre put on a production entitled The Floating Palais at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  The hall took on the appearance of a 1920s dance hall.  The Shiny Shoe Company’s Star & Garter Band performed on stage and actors, acrobats and singers mingled with the crowd of c. 160.  The production was inspired by the Floating Palais, which was a large floating barge on the Torrens in Adelaide near to the present Festival Theatre.  It saw thousands of people dance there from 1924 until it burnt down in 1927.  They enjoyed dances like ‘The Drag’, ‘The Charleston’ and ‘The North Adelaide Bank Robbery Dance’.  Publicity Officer for the Burra Branch of the Arts Council, Mrs Muriel Bence, said the production, which was The Troupe Theatre’s first in Burra, was a great success.  Part of the proceeds will aid the Redruth Gaol drama event in October.

Senior Constable First Grade, Dean Harris, has left Hallett for Murray Bridge.  He had been in Hallett for six years.  His replacement is First Class Constable Mark Kinsley, who comes from Murray Bridge.  His wife and children Gabrielle (7) and Kirsty (5) will soon join him.

The Regional Conference of the Adelaide Children’s Hospital Auxiliaries met at the Aberdeen Club Rooms recently.  The local auxiliary held its annual meeting before the conference.  Mrs Reva Phillips was re-elected President and Miss Pat Taylor was re-elected Secretary.  Mrs Irene Hirschausen replaces Mrs Sue Goodrich, who has left the town, as Vice-President.  Mrs Margaret Neil was elected Assistant Secretary-Treasurer in place of Mrs Kay Boulger.  The Burra Auxiliary raised $1,100 for this year’s appeal.

Accident.  A Victorian woman received minor injuries when the car her husband was driving left the road near ‘The Gums’ on 28 June.  She was Lauris Rose (52) and her husband was Geoffrey Rose (54) of Heathmont, Victoria.

Accident.  Ms Tricia Stone (23) of Aldinga was taken to Adelaide with head and back injuries after her car rolled over on a dirt road 5 km east of old Koomooloo homestead.  A passenger was uninjured.

Theft.  Police are investigating the theft of 300 litres of diesel fuel from the Highways Department Depot at Burra last month.  The cyclone fence was cut during the night of 8 June.

Bon Accord Mine Site

Burra National Trust has hired Mr David Bannear of Saddleworth to undertake archaeological work at the Bon Accord site.  The aim is to fill in some gaps in knowledge about the site. While there is not much about the Bon Accord Mine in Australian mining journals, Mr Greg Drew of the SA Department of Mines & Energy has found considerable information in the London mining journals.  The proposed dig may uncover the lost foundations of the engine-house and draught chimney.  $1,000 has been allocated for further research and digging.

BCS Year 12 students began their annual internal exams last week.

Burra National Trust is concerned about heritage implications of the Ludgvan Street bypass.  Chairman Mrs Maureen Wright said they were concerned about three historical sites:

The former Settler’s Home Hotel1, which was built in 1855 and later became a private home.

The White Hart Hotel site.  The hotel was built in the 1850s and destroyed by fire in 1916.

The Aberdeen Croquet Club lawns and shelter shed.  The club operated from 1934-19502.

They were also concerned about the Redruth Methodist Church, which dates from 1874 and would be very close to the deviation.  It was nominated for State Heritage Listing.

Mrs Wright believed that when the Morgan-Burrs road was sealed there would be a complete bypass of the town and it would be a pity to lose these heritage sites for a short term development.

If the deviation were to go ahead there should be archaeological work done on two of the sites before they move in.

[Notes:

1 This was not known as the Settler’s Home, but either as the Bushman’s Home or the Bushman’s Rest and it was licensed from September 1855 to 1867.  Referred to as the ‘Bushman’s Home in SA Register 24 March 1863, page 3.

2 The Aberdeen Croquet Club began playing in 1928 on grounds near the Court House.  The lawns referred to above were then growing and were opened for play on 16 February 1929.  I have not found a date for the end of the club, but they had an AGM c. October 1958 and seemed to have operated in the 1958-59 season.  Council agreed to pay the water rates for the Aberdeen Croquet Club (except for excess water) in December 1962, which suggests they were then still active.]

The Burra Burra Mine Model at the Bon Accord Museum is taking shape.  After months of planning a modelling weekend was held last weekend and volunteers helped designer and builder Pam Marlow in putting the model together.  Pam spent her childhood and teenage years immersed in model railways and it was there she gained her skills in creating realistic buildings and landscapes.  The model is based on a number of pictures and drawings and is reproduced on a 1:87 scale.  As this is a standard railway scale, it allowed the purchase of commercially produced extras such as people.  The model covers 30 square metres and the timber alone cost $3,500.  Others have contributed their skills and knowledge, including Moonta historical designer Peter Stitt, local tradesman Brian Salter and historian and local librarian Colin Fidock.  The landscape aspect of the model was completed last weekend and the detailed models of buildings, people and mines will be slotted in during the weeks leading up to the 5 October opening.  The whole thing has been designed in modules so that in future models can be slotted out and replaced by those who feel they can do better, said Pam.  0

BCS.  Three Year 12 students have won their way into the finals of the State Chemistry Competition for 1986.  David bailey, Jamie Coad and Peter Fidock comprised one of the 23 successful teams in the chemical analysis competition.  It is the first time Burra has entered the competition and it was one of three country teams to reach the finals.  A total of 107 teams had entered from 35 schools.

Burra National Trust has doubts about the proposed ORRV reserve at Redbanks.  They would like to see the complete banning of bikes from the area to allow the regeneration of vegetation.  The report on the area says that 91% of the Hundred of Baldina is cleared.  Redbanks is probably the only uncleared area and this is rapidly becoming cleared due to the increase in ORRV use over the last few years.  The Trust thinks it would be easier to keep all vehicles out rather than trying to manage them in part of the area.  They fear the vehicles would not be contained.  The Trust feels that the ORRV users do not fit in with the image of the town they have been trying to promote to tourists.  Another concern is that the area designated for ORRV use is further in from the main road and would be difficult to reach, if not inaccessible for the ambulance to reach.  There are still two people unconscious in Adelaide hospitals from accidents at Redbanks Mrs Wright said.  She also said that the report made scant reference to common flors and fauna; commenting only on rare types.

‘“Redbanks was one of Burra’s favourite picnic spots once – now none of the locals go there,” she said.

“It’s a bit like being tossed out of your own backyard.”’

Burra Burra DC

The new Chairman of the DC is Jack McMahon.  He replaces Cr James Hawker, who has been Chairman since 1981.  Cr Hawker announced at the July meeting that he would not be available for re-election.

Cr McMahon will stay in the chair until 9 May 1987, the date of the next periodical election for the council.

He has represented Leighton Ward for about seven years.  Cr Kellock was elected Deputy Chairman.  Cr Hawker’s resignation was accepted with regret and a motion of appreciation was passed.

In reflecting on his time as Chairman, Cr Hawker said Burra had gone through a remarkable awakening of appreciation for the significance of heritage.  He said one reason for resigning the position was his increasing involvement with the Local Government Association.  Ten years ago he said that the National Trust and heritage matters were low on the list of priorities; now it was assumed by Burra people that the Council should handle conservation and heritage as best we can.  The local branch of the National Trust was one of the most successful in Australia.  Major highlights of his time in office had been the Jubilee grants to Paxton Square cottages, the Bon Accord and Morphett’s Engine-house, the wheelbarrow push and the rise in tourist numbers from 14,000 to 30,000 p.a.

When no nominations were received for the position of Councillor for Farrell Flat Ward, the Council appointed Mr Pat Smith to the position.  Mr Smith (53) is a farmer of Farrell Flat and he replaces Mr Terry Trezise a music teacher who had been transferred to Kangaroo Island.  [Photo.]

Burra Traders’ Association has voiced its objection to the use of Redbanks Reserve as a recreation area for off-road vehicles.  The Chairman Mr Jeff Hirschausen said the traders were strongly opposed to the present use of the reserve by off-road vehicles and believed that the proposed new rules would be virtually impossible to police.  He said the site would be subject to desecration, deterioration and ultimately destruction.  In the past accidents there had placed a severe strain on emergency services.

Cottages for the Elderly

Four new cottages for the elderly may be built in the town.  The tow-bedroom cottages have been planned for Kingston Street near Paxton Square.  The plans are currently with the Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning, which will decide whether or not they blend in with Burra’s heritage environment.  They will then go to the Council’s works committee.  If approved the project will be a joint venture between the SA Housing Trust, who will build the homes, and the Council, who will provide the land.

Burra Traders’ Association has expressed a concern that the prices and presentation of some traders is affecting the business in the town.  People are going to Gawler rather than shopping locally.  Traders are encouraged to improve their prices and to improve the presentation of premises, some of which have not been upgraded for forty years.  Adjoining traders should opt for a common colour scheme and a display of heritage colours was available at the Council.  Parking was also discussed.  There had been some criticism of the Market Square redevelopment, but the only customer parking lost in this had been illegal parking.  A quick survey had shown that 22 of the parks were occupied by traders and their employees rather than by customers.  The Association felt there was ample parking, but thought employees could be provided with parking behind Bence’s Shop.  This proposal will be put to Council.

BCS decided not to host a South African exchange student last month.  Recently there was controversy in Clare when a similar decision was made.  The Burra decision was made through a consensus of staff and parents, primarily because they felt that such a student may not have been exposed to the current Australian opinion on apartheid and as a result may have felt intimidated.  Avoiding being seen to endorse the current apartheid system had been a secondary consideration, but was not the main reason, said Principal Mr Henderson.

Burra Traders’ Association has arranged a public meeting later this month to consider whether the American ‘Main Street’ concept could be implemented in Burra.  Guest speaker will be town planner and National Trust member, Mr Don Heale.

Burra Mine.  Members of the Burra Apex Club have discovered the old miners’ entrance to Morphett’s Shaft.  The tunnel, which is about 18 metres from the shaft caved in during the 1920s and was also back filled.  The Department of Mines will fund its retimbering so that underground tours can be conducted.  A member of the club said it had taken about three weeks to find the entrance.

Burra Hospital Secretary, Mr J. Chilton has sought to allay the fears of some members of the community about possible changes to the town’s hospital services.  Recent reports have said the Health Commission has plans to restrict services in smaller country hospitals, by centralising obstetrics and surgery in larger centres.  He said that to date no information from the Health Commission detailing these objectives had been received by Burra Hospital or any other Hospital in Central Sector Country Area 2 (Snowtown, Clare, Riverton, Burra and Blyth).  It is anticipated discussions will start soon.  When similar proposals were planned in the Barossa Valley there was considerable opposition and the proposals were modified to the satisfaction of all concerned.  The staff and Board of Burra Hospital will strenuously oppose any attempt to reduce or remove existing services and will seek public support if required.

The Burra Cycling Classic was held on 2 august and attracted 33 of the state’s top riders, including Chris Turtur, brother of Olympic star, Mike Turtur.  The route took riders through Clare, Sevenhill, Watervale, Auburn, Saddleworth, Manoora and back to Burra.  It was the first time the race had started and finished at Burra.  This year the League of SA Wheelmen thought it would be a good idea to return to Burra and spend the night there.  The choice of a 150 km route was also in honour of Jubilee 150.  It was successful and the League now intends to return to Burra next year.  It was a valuable preparation for another major event of the cycling year; the Mt Gambier road race, which will be held next weekend.

The league represents the interests of professional cyclists around the state and is a member of the Union Cyclists International.  Handicap time winner of the race was Malcolm Clasohm of Whyalla in 4 hours 7 minutes 35 seconds and the outright winner was Simon Gabrynowicz in 4 hours 19 minutes.

BCS.  Members of the SRC have been redesigning the school uniform.  They have suggested a ‘more dressy’ alternative uniform for off-campus activities such as debating competitions and even school trips.  The ideas have been submitted to senior staff.  The traditional brown windcheater with gold school logo has been substituted by a brown jumper with an embossed monogram.  Girls have been given the option of substituting the usual brown trousers with a box pleated skirt with checks in the school colours.  A display of the clothes has been set up in the school foyer to stimulate comment from staff, students and parents.  A decision will be made soon.

Burra Burra Dc is negotiating with the AWU over the employment of five workers.  District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said that reports that five men had been sacked were incorrect.  He believed a deputation would be made to the Minister of Transport Mr Keneally to discuss the issue of road funding for 1986-87.  A media report on Tuesday had cited the President of the local Government Associated as saying that five men had been laid off.  Mr Walsh said the Council was concerned about future employment levels which relied on Highways Department contracts, especially in the light of projected budget cuts of $30 million.

Alleged Assault

Burra police are investigating an alleged assault in the Council office on Thursday.  An invalid pensioner who suffers from a back problem went to the office to collect information on Council finances.  It is alleged a scuffle broke out with the Chairman of the DC following an argument with another employee.  Police confirm that the pensioner had laid a complaint and that they were seeking witnesses.

The Bon Accord Mining Museum is almost complete following a clean up and working bee a fortnight ago.  National Trust Chairman Mrs M. Wright said that the cottage has been cleaned and floor coverings have been laid in the Engineer’s workshop in readiness for the mounting of display panels.

District Clerk Mr R. Walsh said on Tuesday that he was delighted that a further tourist grant of $68,000 had been announced by the Minister of Tourism Ms Wiese at the weekend for further tourist development.  The funds come from the Tourism Development Assistance Scheme.  Some of the money will be used to beautify the area around Morphett’s Engine-House, with walking trails, lookouts and other landscape work.  The engine-house, which houses [sic: for housed] a Cornish beam engine used for pumping during the mining era of the late 1800s, will be opened in October along with the almost completed Bon Accord social history museum.  Ms Wiese said the mining area at Burra was an underdeveloped attraction, which would boost tourist appeal in the Mid North.

Burra Burra DC has a new assessment and a new rate.  The new assessed value was $94,794,830.  This was an increase of 50% and had been part of a series of land assessments by the Valuer General’s Department.  The last assessment was in 1983.  Ratepayers who wished to appeal against their assessment were encouraged to call at the Council Office as soon as possible to inspect the notice.  Objections should be lodged at the Valuer General’s office by 8 September.  Mr Walsh said the rate increase had been held to an overall 7.64% as a consideration of the rural economic situation.  The estimated income from rates this year would be $557,640.  The rate for effluent drainage remained the same at $48 for households, $28 for vacant allotments and $21 for maintenance rate per unit.  The road rental rate remained unchanged.  In Burra township the minimum rate had risen from $200 to $230, from $140 to $160 for the townships of Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat.  Outside the townships the minimum rate was $100.

The United Farmers & Stockowners have organised a Rural Expo in Burra next Friday as a fundraiser for the Farmers’ Fighting Fund.  Stalls will sell a large range of crafts and there will be educational displays.  There will also be displays by the Department of Agriculture and the Woods and Forest Department.  There will be a demonstration of farm computers and their use in cash flow budgeting, as well as displays of electrical appliances including microwave ovens and food processors.  Accountants and investment advisors will offer free farm management advice.

Heritage Town Project to Open in October

Morphett’s Pumphouse, the Bon accord Mine Museum and the Kingston Street row of Paxton’s Square Cottages, which together make up The Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project, will open on 5 October.

The opening will be performed by the Minister for Mines & Energy Mr Payne.  He will be accompanied by the Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee, Mr K. Bonython, the Chairman of the DC Cr J. McMahon and the Chairman of the steering committee Mr J. Hawker, on a tour of the three centres before the opening.  Burra National Trust President Mrs M. Wright said invitations were posted this week and work was in its final stages.  She said that Morphett’s Pumphouse looked stunning and was really the most striking of the projects.  The stonework on the exterior has been re-pointed, the shaft in front of the building has been re-timbered and the old work tunnel leading to the shaft was being restored.  This had been made possible by $5,000 from the $68,000 grant announced last week.  The remainder of the money will be used for drainage, roads and landscaping of the site.  The interior of the building had been refitted with timber landings.  These have appropriate circular and rectangular spaces where the cylinder and mechanical gear would have been when the pump was operating in the 1800s.  An outdoor platform leads out from the opening where the engine boom projected.  This will serve as an observation area of the mine, especially the open cut and Morphett’s Shaft, which is directly below.  When finished the building will have interpretive signs on each landing.  The final cost of the Morphett Pumphouse project will be in the order of $115,000; paid for by Jubilee 150 grants.

The social history museum at the Bon Accord Mine site is also nearing completion.  Pam Marlow, the model maker, will devote the first week of the school holidays to completing the model.  The National Trust had received a $3,200 grant from the History Trust of SA to illuminate the old Bon Accord Shaft and work on the special lighting effects will begin this weekend.  Interpretive signs and graphics were currently being prepared in Adelaide and consultant designer Peter Stitt will return soon to assist with their placement.  He had also been employed under a History Trust grant.

The Kingston street row of Paxton Cottages is now complete.  This includes the new manager’s residence and the Bible Christian Chapel.  Mrs Wright understood interpretive signs would be erected there when it became functional as the booking office.  The official opening of the three projects will take place at Morphett’s Pumphouse after the inspection tour by the official party.  Members of the community were encouraged to attend the opening, in period costume if possible, and to inspect each site after the official opening.

Orienteering at World’s End

The challenge between Australia and New Zealand’s relay for orienteering will be conducted near World’s End next Thursday.  This annual event for the Silva Trophy involves men’s and women’s teams in various aged classes from under 16 to over 55.  Each team consists of three runners.  As well as the national teams there will be teams representing Australian States.  A total of more than 500 competitors will take part.

The District Council of Hallett has applied to the Local Government Advisory Commission for the Hundreds of Kingston, Mongolata, Rees and part of the Hundred of Ayers to be transferred from the Burra Burra DC to the DC of Hallett.  The Acting District Clerk Mrs Blieschke said this was in response to a request from electors in the areas concerned, who felt they were not getting enough services from the Burra Burra DC.  She said road maintenance was the key issue.  A meeting of electors will be held in the Hallett Institute later this month to discuss the proposal.

Burra Community Library.  The mezzanine floor for the local history collection has been completed and the staircase should be installed this week.  This $21,000 alteration has been jointly financed by the District Council, the Education Department and the Libraries Board of SA.  The new floor is supported by steel girders.

The Rural Expo in Burra last Friday [see previous issue] attracted about 500 visitors.

Collinsville has fared very well at the Royal Adelaide Show, setting a world record price of $102,000 for a ram at the Adelaide Merino Ram Sale.  The ram with strong, dense, well-nourished wool of 27.8 micrometres will be used in an A1 program by Goyaike Breeding Society at Santa Cruz in Argentina’s southwest.  The same buyers paid $26,000 for another Collinsville ram.  The previous world record price was $79,000 for a Collinsville ram sold in 1981.  Joel Burke of Wyoming USA was the losing bid on the top priced sheep, but he bought one East Bungaree ram and twelve other Collinsville rams for a total of $284,600, paying $66,00 for Collinsville’s first pen.

The Local government Advisory Commission was last week presented with a petition signed by 190 ratepayers from the Burra Burra DC, requesting secession from that Council to the Dc of Hallett.  Minutes from a ratepayers’ meeting at Hallett welcomed the secession and there was also a submission from the DC of Hallett.  Mr B. Gebhardt, who had signed the petition, said dissatisfaction with the Burra Burra DC followed from high rates and a lack of co-operation between the council and its ratepayers.  Meanwhile Jamestown has made a bid for the Hundred of Whyte to secede from the DC of Hallett.  Ratepayers at the Hallett meeting unanimously passed a motion that the Hundred of Whyte should remain in the DC of Hallett.

Burra Traders’ Association organised a meeting last week that supported the ‘main street program’ if a public meeting in Burra accepted the idea.  The concept for Burra would be to present the unique character of the town’s stone buildings with all the shops pulling together.

Jim Kelly the bullocky will feature largely in the Burra Copper Festival in October.  He will tell yarns on the bank of the creek, display his team of bullocks at the showgrounds, take part in the street procession and be at the start of the Gulf Road re-enactment.  He and Jim Lowe, a muleteer, will feature at the Bullocky’s Breakfast.  Another part of the Copper Festival will be the 109th Burra Show.  [It was not the 109th show; see explanatory note 34, 2, 23 Mar. 1977, page 1.]

Paxton Square Cottage Fire

Fire gutted three of the Paxton Square cottages last Sunday.  Arson is suspected.  The fire will not affect this weekend’s Jubilee 150 Heritage Town opening, as the two rows of cottages restored for tourist accommodation were not damaged.  Detective I. Humby of Pt Pirie CIB said the fire probably started in cottage No. 29 which was the worst damaged.  It seems likely that someone lit a mattress there.  Detective Humby said that no long-term damage would result, as the fire was confined to the wooden shingle rooves.  Damage of $35,000 was caused, mostly due to the cost of shingles.  The cottages are Australia’s earliest example of company housing* and housed miners from Burra’s Monster Mine during the 1840s.  They have been progressively restored for tourist accommodation under the direction of the Lewis Board of Management, funded by the State Government.

[This is not strictly true.  The SA Mining Association erected cottages for its workers at Burra as early as 1846 in Thames Street.  It would be surprising if other companies had not done so earlier.  The scale of company’s housing stock at Burra may have been unprecedented.]

A Crop Duster pilot crashed his Piper Pawnee plane about 7 km southwest of Burra last week.  The man from Queensland had noticed a damaged wheel after take-off.  After dumping his load of spray chemicals, he tried to land, but touched down on the damaged side of the plane, which then spun round.  The pilot walked away unharmed, but soon afterwards the plane burst into flames and was almost completely destroyed.  [Photo]

Burra apex Sportsperson of the Year is Mrs Estelle Nicolls, nominated for her achievements in bowls.  Junior winner was Darren James, who was nominated for football, cricket and athletics.

Burra Heritage Town Jubilee 150 Project will be opened by the Minister of Mines & Energy, Mr Payne at Morphett’s Enginehouse this weekend.  Mr K. Bonython, Chairman of the Jubilee 150 Committee, will be the guest speaker.  The three project sites are Morphett’s Enginehouse, the Bon Accord Museum and the Kingston Street wing of the Paxton Square Cottages.  These cottages are prime heritage sites and the restored cottages will be used for tourist accommodation.  ‘Morphett Enginehouse was imported from Cornwall and used to pump water from the mines.’  [This is obviously incorrect; its design was imported from Cornwall.]

‘The roof has been restored with slate and its chimneys and floors have been re-timbered with imported wood, Mr Wright said, because no mills in Australia were big enough to handle the size of timber needed.

[Sic: its chimneys have been re-timbered!  It had no chimneys and the chimney that served the adjacent boiler house was demolished in the 1920s.  It has not been restored.]

The top section of Morphett’s Shaft has been re-timbered and the side entrance to it has been re-dug and opened to visitors.

Mr Wright said the Bon Accord Mine site was originally intended to tap into the [lode of the] Monster Mine, but it was never a success.  Instead it became the source of Burra’s main water supply.  [That is prior to the town’s connection to Murray River water in 1966.]

The Bon Accord mine shaft is covered with glass so visitors can look into the shaft.

There is a display of shovels, picks and other mining artefacts recovered from the mine during open cut operations in the 1970s.  There is also a display of the social history of the town and a model of the Burra Burra Mine made by Pam Marlow.  Burra was significant Mr Wright said, because it and Kapunda were the first two mines in Australia to pay dividends to owners.  Mining had begun here in 1845.

72, 5, 9 October 1986, page?

The Bon Accord Mine Site & Museum was opened last weekend.  Mr Salter, the caretaker, said the approximately 500 visitors had an excellent reaction to the displays of Burra’s social and mining history.  He also works the forge and that and the lighting in the mine shaft had particularly caught visitors’ attention.  The strobe lighting in the shaft gives the impression that the viewer id descending the 27 m to the water level.  The shaft itself is about 100 m deep.  Johnny Green, the miners’ mascot, is a feature of the display as well as other aspects of Cornish culture.

‘Johnny stands on top of Peacock’s Chimney, and according to Mr Salter, one morning when the miners were about to go down the mine shaft , and they discovered that Johnny had fallen off the Chimney, they refused to go down it.’

[This sounds like a modern fabrication.  Johnny Green is now placed on top of the relocated Peacock’s Chimney, but when the mine was in operation the figure was first placed on the shears in front of Roach’s Engine House.  It can be seen there in S.T. Gill’s painting ‘Surface Operations of the Burra Mine’ of 1850.  When the pump there was replaced a new Johnny Green was placed on the shears over Schneider’s Engine House in about 1852 and can be seen there in William Bentley’s painting of 1857.  In 1858 it was moved to the shears over Morphett’s Shaft, where it remained until the latter was destroyed by fire in 1925.  It was never on a chimney.]

One of the displays is of old mining tools recovered from the mine during operations in the 1970s.  The rarest item is a leather bucket; believed to be the only one in existence from the mine.  There is a miner’s hat made of papier mâché, and a candle holder.  In another part of the museum is the model of the mine as it was in 1860, made by Pam Marlow.  This was commissioned as a Jubilee 150 project and measures 5 m x 6.5 m.  Mr Salter made the showcase for the model on which Pam laboured for about five years.  The Bon Accord cottage has also been restored for tourist accommodation and is under the care of Mr Salter and his wife.

Fri.:	An afternoon art and craft fair, followed by an evening country music concert on the banks of the creek.

Sat:	Burra Show & National Trust sites open.

Sun.:	Street procession, Burra Yacht Club Regatta and an evening cabaret.

Mon.	Bullockies Breakfast and launch of the Gulf Road re-enactment.

She’ll Be Riot will also be produced by Flinders University Drama students at Redruth Gaol.

The procession will start at Peacock’s chimney and go through Market Square before turning up Kingston Street and then Smelts Road to BCS Oval.  The floats, bands, vintage and veteran cars, clowns and people in period costume will be joined by Jim Kelly and his bullock team who will be participating in the Gulf Road re-enactment beginning on Monday.  Entertainment on the bank of the Burra Creek will include bands, novelty events and food stalls

72, 5, 9 October 1986, page 6

Burra Yacht Club Regatta at the weekend is for anything but professionally built craft.  Vessels must be home made and anything that looks like having a fair chance of winning will be nobbled a little bit.  Rafts of beer cans and milk cartons are common, though the winner in 1982 was more unusual; being made from two FJ Holden car bonnets welded together.  Four racing events are planned along with a Dragon Boat race, a water-based tug o’ war and a thong throwing event.  Live bands will play through the day and proceeds will aid local charities and service projects.

She’ll Be Riot will be produced in Redruth Gaol.  An old meaning of ‘riot’ is revelry and this is what the Flinders University Drama students aim to offer the audience in this work that is based on a 1921 riot at the Redruth Gaol when six inmates escaped.  They have spent the last twelve months researching and preparing the presentation, which will involve food, music and audience involvement.  One lady interviewed was an eye-witness to the 1921 riot and her story became the focus for the images around which the play revolves.

The Coppertown Festival in Burra at the weekend saw the streets overflowing with visitors.  Police reported no problems.  The Burra Show was the most successful for years.  It featured blade shearing demonstrations.  The Cavalcade of Cars was a highlight and was won by Mr Barry Allen of Wallaroo with his 1926 Chrysler.  Many people dressed in period costume for the street procession, which finished near the bank of the creek where the annual regatta of the Burra Yacht Club drew the crowds.  On Monday the Gulf Road re-enactment started its three week journey from Burra to Pt Wakefield.  The performance of She’ll Be Riot by Flinders University Drama students in the Redruth Gaol was a success.

72, 6, 16 October 1986, page 4

She’ll Be Riot was quite superb at the Redruth Gaol.  It effectively showed people what life in the Redruth Reformatory was like.  The audience was led around the cells to see cameo scenes in each cell.  One audience member, Mr Colin Fidock, said the performance portrayed the life of the girls in the reformatory as well as the depravation [sic] of the copper miners.  [Should this read ‘deprivation’?]

‘The performance really got over the message of how difficult it would have been,’ said Mr Fidock.

Mrs Nicholls said the audience ‘clapped the goodies and booed the baddies’ as they followed the action around the gaol.

Both Mrs Nicholls and Mr Fidock mentioned the cell containing a girl with a skeleton bridegroom that gave an insight into the desperation of the girls who would marry men much older than themselves just to escape.

The second half of the performance focused on the riot itself.

The Coppertown Festival Procession went off without a hitch.  More than 1000 people took part and many dressed in period costume.  The procession took about an hour to pass.  There were four bands*, about 100 floats, and lots of children dressed as clowns on bikes.

[* Royal Caledonian Pipe Band, City of Elizabeth Pipes and Drums Band, Dick Frankel’s Jazz Band and the Tanunda Junior Brass Band.]

The Burra Yacht Club Regatta was very successful and the secretary of the club was more than pleased with the money raised, the attendance and the way the day had unfolded.  Some contestants sank or fell into the water, were hit with water bombs or failed to finish, but the event was huge fun.  The club had record returned from the souvenir and beer booths.  The crowd was estimated at 4,000 to 4,500 as most of those who watched the procession then drifted to the regatta.  The overall winner of the Dragon Boat race was ‘Matulick Maulers and the winner of the open class event was ‘The Pink Panther’ from Burra.

The Burra Show was described by the Show Society’s President Mr J.G. Duncan as probably the best for ten years.  Attendance was between 3,000 and 4,000 and gate takings were about $4,000, which the secretary Mrs J. Jamieson said would have been a record.  The central theme for the show was wool and the blade shearing demonstrations created a lot of interest.  One display that drew a lot of interest was the fleece from the ram that sold for $102,000 at the Royal Adelaide Show recently.  The Grand Parade included Jim Kelly’s bullock team, which was a grand sight.  [A few results are printed.]

Burra Branch of Prince Alfred Old Collegians will hold its annual dinner at the Burra Hotel next Saturday.  Mr Murray Tiver will chair the function.

KESAB gave Mt Bryan Primary School a pat on the back recently.  The improvements to the school include: a new bore and pump, new electrical and water services, renovations of a store shed, upgrading of the school oval and the appointment of a new groundsman.

BCS’s publication Relatively Speaking was launched last week by the English Language Curriculum Director Ms C. Woods.  Over 400 students aged from 3 to 17 contributed.  Mr P. Quick of BCS co-ordinated the effort and he said that half the 250 people who attended the launch were in period costume.  Copies of the book were given to C. Fidock for his work on it, to the Harris Family of Farrell Flat, who thought of the punning title and to Louise Fidock, who designed the cover.  Schools involved were BCS, Farrell Flat, Booborowie, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Leighton and the Burra Kindergarten.

Burra Hospital secretary-manager Mr J. Chilton criticised a discussion paper on obstetrics and neo-natal care written on behalf of the Government steering committee by Dr S. Britton.  This suggests the cutting of these services at Burra.  Mr Chilton said two babies would have been delivered on the side of the road in the past year if the services had already been cut.  He has called on the community to rally round in an effort to save the services.  He feared that if the neo-natal services go it would have a snowball effect and result in the loss of the doctor.  Then a decline in nursing and chemist services would ensue.  He feared the transfer of accident and emergency services to Clare.  The nearest hospital to the east was at Waikerie.

Bullockies who left Burra more than a week ago are making steady progress ‘along the Grain Trade Re-enactment route.  [Sic: the route was for the copper ore trade, not grain!]

Merino & Poll Merino rams averaged $715, which was more than $200 up on last year’s average.

[Details are printed.]

Burra’s Annual Merino & Poll Merino Ewe Sale was held last Wednesday.  A total of 782 sheep were sold at a gross total of $46,637.  Fourteen studs offered ewes and the overall average price was $60.  [Details are printed.]

Accident/Obituary. Darren Andrew Ames aged 23, a bank employee of Ridgehaven, died instantly when the car he was driving collided head on with another car on the highway some 23 km south of Burra last week.  A passenger received critical injuries and was later flown to RAH from Clare Hospital by helicopter.  The two occupants of the other car, both from Mt Bryan were also seriously injured and were admitted to the Burra Hospital.

The Melbourne Cup Luncheon to be held in the Burra Town Hall will feature a parade of gowns from 1836-1986.  Proceeds will aid the Burra Hospital.  President of the committee Mrs C. Stockman said about 250 had indicated they would attend and they hoped to raise $2,000.

BCS.  An instrumental workshop will be held at the school as a forerunner to the establishment of a Burra School Band.

Burra Community Library will hold an open day to show off its new local history floor next month.  Built to house historical records, the mezzanine floor cost about $21,000.  This cost was shared by the Education Department, the Library Board of SA and the Burra Burra DC.  A complete set of volumes of the SA Register and any other records which mention Burra are included in the collection, Principal Mr Henderson said.

[The SA Register volumes cover most of the period of the Burra Mine’s operation; they are not a complete set of the paper.]  The collection includes the Ian Auhl index.

Bungaree Bloodlines Sale.  The first combined Bungaree Bloodlines commercial sheep sale was held at Burra on 31 October.  Elders Pastoral and Dalgety Bennetts Farmers sold a total of 6,000 sheep from Bungaree, East Bungaree, North Bungaree and Anama, the Bungaree daughter studs and Bungaree Bloodline commercial breeders.  [Further details are printed. And 3 photos are printed 73, 1, 20 November 1986, page 5.]

Burra Branch of the National Trust will hold a garden party at Princess Royal Homestead this weekend.  The homestead is close to Burra and will give people another chance to wear their period costume said President Mrs M. Wright.  About 60 people are expected to attend.  Vice-President Mrs C. John said it was a good opportunity to visit Princess Royal, which was not open very often.  She said it was probably the classiest building in the district.

ETSA has begun inspecting its power lines in the area to check for points of danger as the fire season approaches.  Vegetation near the lines would be inspected for potential dangers.

The Main Street Program has improved Burra according to Mr S. Woolley of the Burra Traders’ Association.  Last week a meeting of the Association was addressed by Mr D. Hele from the USA on the subject of the program.  Mr Woolley said that many individual shop owners had started to improve their premises in small ways.  The overall plan for the future was to improve the Market Square area.  Traders were planning street entertainment and the appearance of Father Christmas this year.

BCS students released about 200 helium-filled balloons with messages of peace on them as part of their Armistice Day peace assembly.  Principal Mr R. Henderson said this was the culmination of peace studies throughout the school for the International Year of Peace.  The balloons were paid for by selling peace badges and having a uniform free day.

Princess Royal Garden Party

Burra National Trust President Mrs Wright said the garden party last weekend had been a sell-out.  The weather was ideal and the grounds perfect.  Mrs Wright said it was the first time a tour of a period building had been organised* and they had no trouble selling tickets.  She said many people did not realise that the building was privately owned and therefore not open to the public.  The event raised about $400 for the general funds of the branch.  It would build up funds, which in the past year had mostly been spent on the Bon Accord Museum project, which had been the focus of the branch’s work all year.

[*This was not true and prompted a sharp letter from Mr & Mrs Ian Auhl: see 73, 2, 27 November 1986, page 4.]

SA’s 1987 Mid North Merino Field Days will be condensed to three days, 16 March to 18 March, with 53 studs participating.  Several Jamestown studmasters have said they felt disadvantaged by the four day format because many visitors were unwilling to travel further north after calling at the larger studs earlier in the week.  Some will now move their rams south on Tuesday and Wednesday for better exposure.  [The field days program is printed.]

BCS.

A report on progress towards the establishment of an old scholars association was presented to the School Council at its AGM on Monday night.

The school would be closed early in 1987 so a review of the school’s philosophy and practices can be held.  Members of the school’s curriculum committee would meet at the school in 1987 to discuss plans for the future.

Five new members were elected to the School Council.

One student received first prize in the Sir Mark Oliphant Science Competition.

73, 2, 27 November 1986, page 4

Mr & Mrs Ian Auhl write a letter to the editor re the comments of Mrs M. Wright on the Princess Royal garden party.

We were surprised to read that this occasion was ‘the first time a tour of a period building had been organised.’

‘We were also surprised, as no doubt Mrs A. Tennant of Princess Royal might have been, to read that “people did not realise the building was privately owned and therefore not open to the public.”’

For the record the Burra Branch of the National Trust organised three previous visits and inspections of Princess Royal.  Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant were founders of the Burra Branch and the first visit took place at their invitation on Sunday 1 October 1967 in conjunction with the Adelaide and Waikerie Branches.

The second occurred on Sunday 11 May 1969, as part of a 3-day Seminar ‘The Historic Copper Towns of SA’, which was a joint effort of the Burra Branch of the National Trust and the Department of Adult Education of the University of Adelaide.

A third visit was on 19 April 1970, when the Burra Record of 21 April 1970 reported 1,000 visitors and $900 was raised for the Burra Branch.

‘Having played a large part, along with Mr Lewis Moore, Me Stanley J. Woollacott and Dr Derek Whitelock, in organising these visits, I feel justified in seeking space for the correction of the information given by Mrs Maureen Wright.’

‘Surely with the micro-film of the ‘Burra Record’ and the minutes of the Burra Branch at her disposal, Mrs Wright could have referred to these earlier visits to and inspections of Princess Royal, all by invitation of Mrs and (the late Mr Andrew Tennant.’

The Burra Creek Leaks

Burra District Clerk Mr R.D. Walsh said Council was concerned about water seeping through the walls of the creek.  Financial aid would be sought to plug these leaks.  No. 1 bore of the creek had been closed for the rest of the financial year to allow the problem areas to be identified.  Although the water loss was not at present a problem, it could be in the future and would be monitored carefully.  He had no idea of likely costs at this stage.  Burra’s main water supply came from the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline, but ‘as the creek was Burra’s main tourist attraction, the Council wanted to keep it that way’.

Burra Burra DC

Four six-month-old claret ash trees in Market Square have been poisoned.  Police were investigating.  The trees had been donated by the people of Burra and would be replaced by other claret ash trees.

BCS.  Four students from the school’s Student Representative Council will attend a course run in December at the Burra campus of TAFE on how to run meetings.

It has been decided that the existing brown windcheater will remain as an option for students, with the jumper being used for more formal occasions.

Principal Mr R. Henderson has been appointed principal of Oakbank Area School.  The new principal at Burra will be Mr M. Day, presently principal of Coober Pedy Area School.

An outbreak of Rubella among primary school students has now been cleared up.  At one point about two thirds of one junior primary class had been affected at the same time.

Rubella vaccinations for Year 8 students would probably be in March next year.

Two students, Petrea Piggott of Year 9 and Justin Hall of Year 12, have been chosen in the State Team for the National All School Athletics Championships to be held in Sydney in December.

Petrea also qualified for the Under 16 national championships in Adelaide next March.

Accident.  A car rolled over on the Burra-Clare Road east of Farrell Flat last Saturday morning.  The driver, Mr P. Gray received minor injuries, but the car was later destroyed by fire when the battery ignited oil and petrol.

Burra DC

Chairman Mr J. McMahon said the Burra DC would still be viable if parts of it were annexed to Hallett.  Comments to the contrary were just figments of someone’s imagination.  His response followed hearings of the Local Government Advisory Commission in Pt Pirie last week.  The Council’s debt represented 23.15% of its rate revenue and as far as he was aware in SA only Laura DC had a smaller debt.  The areas wishing to join Hallett represented 22.4% of Burra’s rate revenue, which would affect it, but not destroy its viability.  He said the main reason the area wished to secede was because of the condition of roads.

73, 3, 4 December 1986, page 4

BCS.  The SA College of Advanced Education Magill Band performed for junior school students at Burra last Friday.  About 35 performers played varieties of music to suit all tastes and had the audience in the palm of their hand for the performance.  About 250 students from reception to Year 9 attended.

Principal R. Henderson is leaving Burra after five years, to become Principal of Oakbank Area School.  He said one of the most rewarding things while at Burra had been seeing almost 100% of school-leavers find jobs.  Retention rates at the school had been improved; a change he attributed to a more flexible course structure.  One of his aims had been to provide ‘more access to a wider range of interest’ in the community.  A vertically-structured class system in the secondary school theoretically allows students from any year level to study together provided they were of common academic abilities.  This has made Burra an example for other community based schools to follow in SA and interstate.  The responsibility for choosing courses has been placed on students themselves rather than on teachers and parents.  This he felt had been a factor in placing so many students in jobs.  A unified sense of community, which focused on the school, was one of the first things Mr Henderson had noticed about living in Burra.

Burra National Trust Branch will hold a Christmas party this week at the Bon Accord museum.  In the coming year the focus would be on renovating the Redruth Gaol.  President Mrs Wright said the branch had received a grant for $50,000 from the Commonwealth Bank and was also part of a Bicentennial Project.  An architect will be employed to establish what can be done with the money available.  One wall badly needs re-pointing and another priority was the installation of toilets.

Burra Creek.  The draining of the creek may lead to the cancellation of some of the public celebrations on New Year’s Eve if not enough water was in place by this weekend.  Mr S. Woolley secretary of the Burra Yacht Club said ‘you cannot expect people to enjoy themselves in stagnant water.’  Celebrations would continue, but without the water activities.

KESAB Awards

Burra won two certificates in the 1986 awards announced last week.  [The report does not make it quite clear in which categories the awards were won, but it appears they went to the Burra Senior Citizens’ Club for special Jubilee 150 projects and for heritage work.

The Mt Bryan Primary School won a special school award for its tidy town’s entry.

Christmas in Burra

Father Christmas will visit Market Square on Christmas Eve.  Publicity Officer for the Burra Traders’ Association Mrs G. Smedley said music was being played through a loud-speaker system in Burra and Christmas decorations are hanging in the streets.  Some shops have been painted in heritage colours.  Secretary Mrs Y. Barton said is was not compulsory for all shops to renovate in the same manner, but the idea was generally to blend the newer shops in with the older renovated ones.  The Burra Tourist Information Office, the Commercial Hotel and Sara’s Secondhand Shop have all been painted using heritage colours.  Mrs M. Wright, proprietor of Sara’s Secondhand Shop said the Heritage Branch of the Department of Heritage & Planning was acting as advisor to those wishing to renovate buildings in an authentic colour scheme.

BCS

Five teachers are leaving, including the Principal Mr R. Henderson.

Mr K. Reynolds, a secondary Biology and Chemistry teacher and Mr R. Cuttle, a Maths and Science teacher, are both going to Washington State in the USA.  They will be replaced by two US teachers.  Others leaving are:

Adelaide Wool Sale 9 December.  Top price in the Burra District went to M. & P. Siegert with 494 cents.

The ‘Burra Barrow Birds’, who won $100 as the only women’s team to complete the 1985 Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push, have donated an electric barbecue to the town.  It will be unveiled with a suitable plaque on Sunday.  They were also given an extra $500 by the Retravision Boilers, a Broken Hill team of men aged over 40, and this also went towards the barbecue.  Mr S. Woolley for the Burra-Broken Hill Barrow Push Committee said the event would become bi-annual and there would be no push this year, although plans were underway for one in 1988.

Jamestown Railway Station closed last week.

Mt Bryan East Telephone Subscribers will be able to call Burra at local call rates from 1 March 1987 following a decision to redraw the charging zone boundary to bring Mt Bryan East into the Hallett Standard Zone.  Mt Bryan subscribers will now get untimed local calls between that exchange and Andrews, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Burra, Hallett, Hanson, Hilltown, Spalding, Terowie and Whyte Yarcowie exchanges.

The Annual Burra Bowling Championships were held over the long weekend.  A total of 148 entrants took part.  Winners:

Men’s Fours	Salisbury Rink skippered by Jim Pleasant

Mixed Fours	Merv & Estelle Nicholls and Ray & Lola Jennison

Burra Citizen of the Year, Mrs Olive Oates was presented with her award at the bowling competition on Monday.

Tourists flocked to Burra for the long weekend, although there was no barrow push this year.  Burra Tourist Office recorded more than 380 people.  With a barrow push numbers would be about 1,000.

The ‘Burra Barrow Birds’ Barbecue was dedicated to the town on Sunday on the banks of the Burra Creek.  Despite rainy weather about 10-15 people came to witness the event.  [See details 73, 6, 22 January 1987, page 4. and photograph 73, 9, 12 February 1987, page 2.]

Model T on Display

Burra’s Model T Fire Engine is on display at Jennison’s of Burra.  Mrs R. Page, secretary of the Burra Branch of the National Trust said it was definitely the oldest [motorised] fire engine in SA and possibly in Australia.  After leaving Jennison’s, it will be on display at Richardson’s garage for about two weeks.  As yet the Trust had no permanent site to store the vehicle.  The Model T was restored by Mr John from Adelaide.  A series of pictures of the restoration process was also on display along with some equipment supplied by the Metropolitan Fire Service.  The MFS used the Fire Engine during its Fire Prevention Week program in October.

Burra Cemetery Curator has prepared a report to be handed to the National Trust concerning the state of old headstones at the Burra Cemetery.  There is concern that the wording on some is weathering away and there is nothing that can be done to protect them.

Burra Branch of the National Trust will soon receive a report from an architect on the most effective use of a $50,000 grant to help preserve the Redruth Gaol.

With the end to a page dedicated to Burra news the Burra coverage declined even further and I deem noting beyond 1987 not to be worthwhile from this source.

Terowie & Hallett Institutes may face closure.  This will be discussed at the next Hallett DC meeting.  District Clerk Mrs H. Blieschke said there was a move by the Libraries Board of SA to phase out book borrowing from Institutes.  Borrowers could be serviced through public libraries at Peterborough and Burra.  Hallett had 58 subscribers.  The Executive Director of the Institutes Association Mr R. Broad said the phasing out was part of a 1978 agreement to gradually dissolve town institutes by 1988.  In 1978 there were 165 institutes in SA, but numbers have since dwindled.  The buildings that once housed institutes would probably be handed over to local government authorities.

Jennison’s Sale

Bidding was active at the clearing sale of Jennison’s Tyre Service last Wednesday, which marked the close of 65 years’ business in Burra.  Mr G. Tapscott, Elders auctioneer, said the gross takings were about $18,000.  Mr Ray Jennison’s decision to close the business was based on his ambition to retire at 60.  He plans to spend his leisure time fishing at Port Vincent and improving his golf handicap of 11.  After 30 years as a Ford dealership the Commercial Street premises will now be occupied by Elders Pastoral.  Mr Tapscott said the larger premises would give customers better access, increased stock lines and the use of a forklift for loading.

Elders have been a part of Burra for nearly 100 years.  Their first modest office was at the rear of Drew & Crewes store, next door to their later office that is now the Burra tourist Information Centre.  The two storey premises were built in 1891 and vacated in the 1960s when Elder Smith and Goldsbrough Mort merged.  In 1887 the commission on livestock was a flat rate of 6.5% and in 1890 Elders at Burra sold 204,898 sheep.  Records also show that up to 1892 the total number of sheep sold by agents in Burra exceeded half a million annually.  In 1906 a ‘hi-tech’ piece of office equipment was introduced; a typewriter.  In 1904* the office acquired its first motor vehicle.  Horses and buggies were also retained till 1917.  Elders have now relocated to refurbished premises formerly those of Jennison Ford.  This move provides more space, a large range of stock and easier access.

[* It is interesting that the local paper did not record the arrival of this vehicle.  Cars were first reported in the town in 1905 when they were a rare novelty that scared the horses.]

The Burra Cycling Classic is making a remarkable return to its rightful position on the SA road cycling calendar.  This is largely due to astute promotion over the last three years as a direct result of an offer by Burra identity Mr Peter Reilly to assist in this field.  He has seen the event restored to the top five; a position it seems likely to retain.  Originally a 100 miles race to Adelaide, increasing traffic has made it virtually impossible to either start or finish in Adelaide and so a decision was made in 1985 to start and finish in Burra.  In that year the SA Brewing Co. was approached by the promoters and it offered sponsorship on a modest scale initially.  The Jubilee 150 resulted in SA Brewing Co. and The Seaton Tyre Store (which had provided generous support for several years) as co-sponsors of the race with prize money in excess of $1,000.  This arrangement has been continued for this year.  Organisers have successfully applied for Pro-Am status, which should see an increase in nominations.  On 1 August competitors will  depart from Burra and go to Mt Bryan, return to Burra and then to Hanson, Farrell Flat, Clare, Sevenhill, Penwortham, Watervale, Auburn, Saddleworth, Manoora and Hanson before the final sprint to the finish line opposite the Commercial Hotel in Burra at about 3.30 p.m.

Burra Police warn that there is a dangerous section of highway some 4 km north of Hallett.  This section of road has had three car roll-overs in as many weeks.  Drivers seem to lose control when their front wheels leave the sealed surface and hit the dirt verge.

‘Let’s Not Forget’

A six year long project by the Burra Community Library to compile an obituary index from the Burra Record has been finished.  It is called Let’s Not Forget and covers obituaries for Burra and District from 1848 to 1976.  Twelve volunteers have helped to compile the index as part of the Burra Jubilee celebrations and the Australian Bicentennial.  President of the Burra Community Library Board, Mr Colin Fidock said that Ian Auhl had motivated him to start the project.  The board was especially grateful to the late Anne Perry and to Shirley Thamm who spent many hours reading 102 years of newspapers.  The book will be of great value for any public library, Australian historian or genealogist.  The index will cost $25 and all profits will be reinvested in local history research at the Community Library.

Matthews Emporium staged a furniture and carpet clearance last week and it was every man and women for themselves.  Some keen buyers arrived at 4 a.m. and manager Ross Drew had to face the onslaught of an eager crowd when he opened the doors at 8.45 a.m.  He said he doubted if anything like it had happened in the emporium’s 58-year history.

Burra came in for some praise at a Local Government seminar at the Festival Centre last week.  It was used as an example of what a town could do to boost tourism in hard times by using heritage to attract tourists.  There were many interstate visitors and speakers present as well as the Premier Mr John Bannon and the new Federal Minister for Local Government, Margaret Reynolds.  The theme was how best local government can cope when Federal and State funding dry up.  Past Burra Burra DC Chairman Mr J. Hawker told the conference that Burra was a ‘living heritage town’.  From a town with a static area population of around 2,000 and a 9% unemployment rate in the late 1970s, it had gone to a population of about 4,000 with an annual rate revenue of $1.2 million.  Mr Hawker said, ‘We set ourselves this task and we didn’t get there without aiming; we realised the real wealth in Burra was our heritage.  We have the finest assembly of neo-Victorian buildings in Australia.  We are surviving because we had the desire to survive.’

The town had started purchasing key properties in 1980 and consciously put National Trust members on the Council, which then set about finding out how best to sell projects to Government agencies and departments to attract grants to achieve long term objectives.  The theme was value for money in a living heritage town.  He said several projects not only generated running costs, but made enough profits to start others.

Burra Local History Research Room was opened last month.  It was officially opened by the first principal of the Burra Community School, Mr Chris McCabe.  He was deputising for Mr Ian Auhl, who was unable to attend, but who sent a speech that was ably read by Mr McCabe.  He said Ian had been the catalyst in the quest to record and preserve Burra history.  Earlier the visitors had been welcomed by Chair of the Library Board of Management, Sue Warnes, who had introduced Colin Fidock to address the group on the theme ‘People make local history.’

Mr Fidock paid tribute to Eva and Ian Auhl and then acknowledged the contributions of the many people who had prepared the collection of material for use in the purpose-built room.  Chris McCabe presented a cheque for $500 to the Library Board from Mr & Mrs Auhl.

Also present was the immediate past Principal of Burra Community School, Mr R. Henderson.  He presented two suitably inscribed photographs to go on the wall of the room; one of Ian Auhl and the other of Colin Fidock.  School Council member Helen Stockman announced that word had come from the Education Department that the position of an education officer for Burra would be funded from 1988.  Guests then inspected the collection, displays in the library and enjoyed afternoon tea.  Colin Fidock cut a cake celebrating the ninth birthday of the Community Library.

Accident.  A Falcon station wagon was written off last month at the intersection of the Clare road and the Barrier Highway at Hanson.  It was driven by a local schoolteacher and collided with a trailer being towed by a 4WD utility.  The intersection was redesigned about six months ago.  Local tow truck operator Mr Des Woolley predicts it will be the scene of a fatal accident if stop or give way signs are not erected.
