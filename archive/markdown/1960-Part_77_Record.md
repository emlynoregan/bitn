Weather

Many places in SA recorded a dry year for 1959, but in Burra the recording was 9.3 inches, well above the record low of 7.17 inches in 1914.

Burra School Headmaster Mr M.W. Scriven is seeking board for students in 1960.  So far he has enquiries for several first year boys, but others may come in.

Craig Evans of St Dye St Burra North was the district winner in the 13-18 month section of the H.J. Heinz Co. National Baby Contest.  District winners got a £5 prize.

Burra Rural Youth

27 members attended the Zone Christmas Social at Jamestown on 14 December.  Three attended the Clare Social on 22 December.  28 members visited Burra and Heathmont Hospitals with boxed biscuits for patients and to sing Christmas carols.  Supper was provided at Heathmont by Matron and Mr Barnes.  Proceeds of their Christmas dance will buy a Nativity Scene for Market Square.

Burra Rifle Club entertained the Yunta Rifle Club members at their first shoot for 1960.  Due to Yunta’s limited representation it was decided to have a four man team.  Burra won 370 to 318.

The top scorer was Gordon Webster with 93 off the gun.

Burra Small Bore Rifle Club begins competitive shooting for 1960 tonight.  In the last practice match the best scorers were J. Brown, W. Barker & M. Mitchell.

Christmas Eve in Burra

Christmas music etc. was relayed around the street through four speakers.  Father Christmas arrived at about 9.10 p.m. and distributed ice creams, bags of sweets and trumpets.  Business houses reported successful Christmas trading generally.

Burra Rural Youth Christmas Eve Dance netted £20-3-0.

Accident.  Fred Atkins broke a bone in his shoulder last week when he fell while working in the ceiling of the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School.  He was knocking out the old plaster ceiling in preparation for a new one and fell 20 feet to the floor.  He also sustained a slight concussion, abrasions and bruising.

Hanson Road.  In the paper of 13 January 1945 it was suggested that there be a new Burra-Hanson Road to meet the Kapunda Road two miles south of Black Springs.  It was suggested that it run along the eastern side of the railway line instead of going past G. Finch’s residence.  On reaching Hanson it would continue past the water tanks on the Whyalla Pipeline and then along the western side of Porter Lagoon to meet the Kapunda Road.  Now fifteen years later the Burra-Hanson section is nearing completion.

Burra Hospital.  Four volunteers planted a couch lawn in front of the hospital last Saturday afternoon.  A sprinkler system had been previously installed to water it.  The workers were E.T. Baulderstone, C.H. Cummins, M. Breen and Dr L.G. Miller.

The Burra & District Swimming Pool will be officially opened on 30 January by Mr G. Stanley Hawker at 3 p.m.  Although the pool has been in use for twelve months the committee had many jobs to do to complete the surrounds and this has delayed the official opening.  A Grand Swimming Carnival will mark the event.

The almost completed post office

Improvements to a number of shops

Improvements at the bowling green

More bituminised streets

Improvements to the oval, lawn tennis courts and the new rifle range

The Town Hall supper room and kitchen

More trees and some lovely gardens

BUT she also noted the ‘dirty, untidy, and “hard to walk on” footpaths and weed infested watertables’ which spoil the solid impression.

Burra Small Bore Rifle Club.  The leading scorers in the 1st stage of the trophy shoot were Mrs W. Barker, R. Robinson & J. Taylor.

Haydon has been particularly active in youth work and during his term the Redruth and Kooringa circuits were amalgamated to form the Burra Circuit.  He was President of the Burra Cricket Association for two years and led the Kooringa tennis team to victory last season.  Mrs Haydon was President of the Redruth Methodist Ladies’ Guild and a member of the Church’s House Committee.

The Morrisons are leaving Burra after Colin Morrison had been teaching in the Burra District for 20 years and at BHS for the last three.  Mr J. Colin Morrison has been appointed headmaster at Wudinna Area School.  His BA degree was formally conferred at a ceremony in Adelaide last December.  He is presently the Secretary of the Burra RSL and was a fighter pilot and instructor in WWII, being awarded the AFC.  He played cricket and tennis in Burra.  Mrs Morrison was formerly Miss McWaters of Burra and has played tennis and badminton here.  She was a member of the Kooringa Methodist Guild.  They and there children Heather, Dean and Jane will leave soon for Wudinna.

Mr Grenville Ireland has been Woodwork teacher at Burra for three years, but has now resigned to take on business life in Adelaide.  He was a member of the Lawn Tennis Club and a keen shooter.  Mr & Mrs Ireland have moved to East Glenelg.

Mr & Mrs F.H. Binks-Williams with children Judy and John moved last week to Seacombe Heights.  Mr Binks-Williams was manager of Elder, Smith & Co. at Burra for the last ten years, but has now been moved to the Adelaide Office.

Weather.  Thunderstorms in the past week have filled many dams to the east.  Some graziers had been carting water for months.  The past week has seen temperatures well over the century with no relief at night, but a cool change arrived on Saturday night and rain began to fall at about 9 a.m. Sunday.  Burra scored 41 points to make 57 for the month.  Some places to the east recorded up to 50 points on Sunday and with earlier thunderstorms some have totalled 150 points for the week.

Burra Town Council, 10 January

Mr Tiver advised to remove old buildings from a block following a request by Mrs E.R. Kotz.

Burra Hospital contribution for 1960 has been set at £410.

Moved Crs Cummins & Lehmann that the name E.R. Davey be removed from the honour roll of Town Clerks.  Carried.

[The honour board of Mayors and Town Clerks was still in the Town Hall in 2014 and Mr Davey’s name was still there.  The name of J. Fogg who was appointed Town Clerk in January 1879 and was compelled to resign in April 1879 is however, missing.  From the reports in the paper he seems to have been extremely neglectful of his work and also to have misappropriated a cheque for £12.  A later report says all but £2 had been recovered.  He was not pursued in the courts because, the paper says, he was not worth 12/-.  He promised to repay the losses when able.

See also comment at 90, 14, 19 April 1960, page 1.]

Burra Swimming Pool Opened
A large crowd attended in perfect weather to see Mr G. Stanley Hawker open the Burra Swimming pool free of debt.  At about 3 p.m. the President of the Committee welcomed all present and thanked all those who had donated cash, materials and labour and announced that the pool could be opened free of debt, due to the recent arrival of a Government subsidy cheque.  There were still things they needed – a filtration plant could be added later.  Mr Topsfield was glad to see the presence of Mr & Mrs R.G. Jeffery (now of Clare), who had been holidaying at Port Broughton.  Mr Jeffery had done a wonderful job as Secretary etc. towards Burra obtaining such a fine asset.  Mr & Mrs Shaw were present too.  Mr Shaw had been the architect for the pool.  Mr Hawker was then asked to open the pool.  Mr Roy Jeffery moved a vote of thanks to Mr Hawker, whom he said had always been ready to assist as MP for the district.

[The editor said that when Mr H. Quirke took over as MP for the district he too had given what assistance he could.]

Mayor Baulderstone also spoke of the wonderful way the pool transformed this section of the creek bank and beautified the whole area.  He listed some who had given much assistance like H.C. Cummins and Keith Spackman.

Mrs Hawker presented the Learn to Swim Campaign Certificates.

The official party had afternoon tea in the Town Hall.  The committee presented Mr Shaw with a silver tray for his services.

Porter Lagoon Picnic Day saw about 100 cars there in the afternoon.  It was windy and the rough conditions meant that the boat races had to be abandoned.  The only boats on the water were those of Lance Fiebig and the Dunn Bros. of Black Springs.  Some water skiing events were also abandoned, but R. Taylor and P. Williams staged a contest and Gerald Day, impersonating a ballroom dancer, successfully went over the ski jump.

A Dart Competition was won by Miss J. Fiebig from Mrs P. Calda 98 to 91.

Mr K. Calda won the shot putt.

The children kept the boat-owners busy after they offered free rides around the lake.

Ron Dewhirst writes with some comments and suggestions about local football:

Years ago we had the formation of Junior Football and over recent years it seems that an ‘in between’ grade is required, but owing to lack of numbers this won’t work.  It could be overcome by having a ‘B’ Grade, which would have no age limits, which appears to be the stumbling block for the present Colts (changed from Juniors).

From the spectator point of view the present six A Grade teams can hardly be considered a great success.  My suggestion is four A Grade and 4 B Grade teams.  Burra, Hallett, Spalding and Booborowie could field A Grade teams.  It seems that Leighton can only function with the assistance of players from other areas and has never had the numbers for a Junior team.

The season would comprise five rounds and two Association matches.

Booborowie would call its B Grade team Leighton – the surplus from Booborowie.

Hallett would call its B Grade team Mt Bryan with the surplus from Hallett’s Redlegs.

Burra would call its B Grade team Redlegs with the surplus from Burra A.

Leighton Oval could be shared with Booborowie Oval.

[He continues of in some detail of where games would be played, the timing of both grades’ matches and some rules about the exclusion of A Grade players from B Grade for finals etc.]

Burra Town Council, 2 February

The Town Clerk reported on progress with the books of the Corporation.

Treasury wrote from Adelaide about the Local Public Works Scheme and payments made to Council under that scheme.

The scheme had its origins in the 1930s when, in order to relieve unemployment, the Commonwealth and State Governments invited local Government to submit proposals for work to be financed from loans and undertook to pay to those local authorities two-thirds of such amounts as were required to amortise such loans over a ten year period.

Burra Council submitted a proposal to improve Victoria Park at a cost of £400, but due to the outbreak of war no start was made.

After the war the matter was revived in 1946 and after some consideration about changing the proposal to the swimming pool, Treasury was advised by a letter dated 24 July 1946 from the Town Clerk that the Corporation would continue with the original proposal to beautify Victoria Park.  The Commonwealth Government’s approval was obtained and Council was advised that it could proceed, by a letter dated 16 October 1947.

In July 1948 the Council sought to amend the proposals to cover a project costing £1,200 – still in relation to the Recreation Ground [Victoria Park].  It was advised that it could do so if it wished, but the two other Governments’ contributions would remain as much as would amortise £400 of the amount borrowed.

In November 1950 a letter from Council advised that work had been completed, along with an accompanying financial statement signed by the then Mayor, the President of the Burra & District War Memorial Committee and the Town Clerk.  Receipts totalling £800 were forwarded for the contractor F.L. Hogan of Booborowie.

As a consequence half-yearly payments of £15-16-5, being ⅔ of the amount needed to amortise a loan of £400 at 3⅜% p.a. commenced on 17 May 1951 and have continued to be paid each half year since.  (Schedule enclosed.)

An agreement was received from the Fire brigade Board for signature concerning the tenancy and tenders for additions and alterations to the Fire Station.

The SA Government Tourist Bureau forwarded £385 for the swimming pool.

Burra Showgrounds – New Wool Pavilion

The Wool Pavilion Committee has commenced work on erecting the new pavilion.  The building will be 30 feet x 30 feet with a roof light facing south to provide even lighting.  Mr R. Fuss and helpers have cemented the bases for the columns of the building.  The frame has been ordered and is due at the end of this week.  Further donations are solicited.

Town Hall Chairs

When Wednesday night films came into operations it was decided to take the profits from them to buy folding chairs for the hall.  It has taken quite a while to accumulate the funds.  After various Councillors investigated possible chairs, which have to be comfortable, light and stackable, a type was selected.  It has been found that Matthew’s Emporium in Burra can supply them for £6-5-0 less 4%, delivered, while the best city price the Town Clerk could arrange was £6-12-6 less 2½% plus delivery charges.  As a result the Council voted to buy 104 ‘Royal’ chairs from Matthew’s Emporium.  They will complete the rows at the back of the hall.

Souvenir Supplement to the ‘Burra Record’

Official opening of the Burra & District Swimming Pool

30 January 1960 at 3 p.m. by Mr G. Stanley Hawker.  [Photos of the pool, Mr Hawker & Mr Roy G. Jeffery.]

The cost of the pool was met by numerous donations of cash, Government subsidy, donated materials and much voluntary labour.  Despite competing with other appeals that raised something like £5,000 during the same period – the Town Hall Supper Room, The Murray Flood Appeal and the War Memorial Oval.

In 1956 it was drawn to the attention of the Burra Progress Association that only 14% of Burra children could swim.  They decided it was time to make that 100%.  Several previous attempts had failed to raise the money for a pool, but they were undeterred.

Approximately 170 people attended a public meeting on 2 March 1956 in Burra Town Hall.  The Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone listed the pros and cons and said any committee elected to carry out the project would need to convince Council that it would not become a liability.

Mr H.J. Topsfield outlined the proposed scheme.  Members of the Progress Association had concluded it was too big a project for them and needed district support.  Mr C.A. Brooks as Acting Supervisor of Physical Education spoke strongly in favour and so did Messrs H.C. Cummins, I. Trigwell, R.G. Jeffery and H.J.B. Jennison.

A motion to proceed was passed unanimously and a committee was formed.  It met first on 3 March 1956.  H.J. Topsfield was Chairman and Mr B.E. Gryst of the Savings Bank in Burra was elected Treasurer with R.G. Jeffery, Headmaster of Burra High School as Secretary.  Mr D. Bednall [solicitor] undertook to draft a constitution and rules.  Discussion and public consultation moved on to site selection.  Visits were made to Mt Barker & Nuriootpa pools.  Both those pools were self-supporting.

On 22 March 1956 it was decided that the pool would be 100 feet x 30 feet with a depth ranging from 3 feet to 9 feet.  On 17 April 1956 a subscription list was opened to try to raise £1,000.

A deputation waited on the Council to see whether the Council would apply for a £1,500 Government subsidy and if they would appropriate a site for the pool.  By 15 May 1956 £246-13-6 had been raised and the Government advised that it would grant a subsidy of £1,500.  By 9 June 1956 £400 had been raised.  The army advised that the Drill Hall site would not become available and the present site was then selected.

By early August the fund stood close to £500.

The River Murray floods that year then occurred and this no doubt slowed subscriptions.  Excavation work began on 14 August 1956, but before it could be completed the equipment was needed for emergency work along the flooded river.

By 28 August the fund had reached £572, but meanwhile the Flood Appeal had reached £1,089.

The architect Keith Shaw talked with the Committee and the builders Messrs C. Parker, Bill Robinson, Len Taylor and Bert Cornelius.

By the end of 1956 £800 had been raised for the pool.

In the first three months of 1957 considerable preparatory ground work was done.  The annual meeting in March 1957 saw the fund at £817 and the principal officers were re-elected.

Mixing concrete: P. Murphy, D. O’Brien & W. Corner.

Wheelbarrowing concrete [M.T. Kellock, L.A. Beinke, J.B. Topsfield & G. Kellock.]

On 2 June 1957 sixty-five men at a working bee gave 312 man-hours of work worth £120.  The first section of the floor was laid.  The second section followed a fortnight later, having been delayed by rain.  The final section was laid on 7 July.

In August 1957 the fund reached £1,007.  A further application for a Government grant of £1,500 was made.  The walls were poured by the end of November and the setting up of the concrete surrounds began.  In February 1958 the walls and floor were sealed.  The pool was slowly filled beginning on 7 February 1958.  The pool was next fenced.  Rural Youth contributed 146 hours of labour in June 1958.  A toddlers’ pool was planned.  Retaining wall and work on planting the slopes etc. followed.  In November 1958 £500 was urgently needed for dressing sheds, kiosk etc. which were estimated to cost £900 to £1,000.  This meant £500 had to be raised to qualify for a £500 subsidy.  Quite quickly a variety of means raised about £270 and foundations were poured and bricks obtained.

[The wading pool was completed on 10 August 1959] On 7 December a working bee painted the wading pool and donations reached over £500.  At the end of the school year in 1958 Mr R.G. Jeffery was transferred to Cleve.

[Although there were no changing rooms at this time] the pool was available for the Education Department’s Learn to Swim Campaign from 5 to 16 January 1959.  154 children enrolled and 100 gained certificates. The instructors were Messrs Tom Bowden & Grenville Ireland.  Check the timeline in 1958-59.  In this report it gets rather jumbled.  THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WHEN 1959 HAS BEEN NOTED.

On 22 January 1959 it was decided to appoint a caretaker and to postpone the official opening till the following season when the pool would really be completed.

Lighting for evening sessions was discussed with Electricity Trust Officers and Mr Bert Beinke was enlisted to install it.  The committee was then led by H.J. Topsfield as President and E. Orchard as Secretary.

A working bee called for 24 November 1959 was disappointing and the pool could not be re-opened as early as had been hoped.  On 30 November 1959 it was re-opened after an energetic band had worked painting the outside of the dressing sheds and doing other necessary jobs.  The remaining major job is the installation of electric light and refrigeration to satisfy the demand for cold drinks.

In February 1959 the first Swimming Carnival was held in the new pool.  It was won by Draysey House.

In January 1960 the Education Department’s Learn to Swim Campaign saw 112 school children gain 204 certificates.  Instructors were Mr L. Pemberton & Miss Judy Kellock.

Prior to the opening floodlights were erected for night swimming and they did an excellent job, though one more on the eastern side will be required when finance permits.

Burra District LCL Meeting at Booborowie

The half-yearly meeting of delegates from Burra LCL was held at Booborowie on the 19 February with a large attendance from across the region.  Mr G.S. Hawker presided.  There was a brilliant address from Senator Clive Hannaford on his visit to America as one of Australia’s delegates to the United Nations.

President G.S. Hawker reported on a quiet political year.  He thought there was too much emphasis on the stabilising effect of secondary industry when three-quarters of export credits came from primary production, especially wool.  Better methods of production and good primary prices for most years since the war have put primary industries on a sounder basis than prior to the 1930s.  These factors have softened the impact of the drought and lower prices.  Secondary industries contribute very little to export income and with rising costs the prospect of their doing so seems remote.  But, their expansion is having an adverse effect on primary industries.

Farrell Flat Tennis Club Ball on 19 February had takings of £34-11-0 and a nett profit of £14.

The Swimming Carnival was held on Friday afternoon.  Draysey House won the shield narrowly from Jennison.  Outstanding performers were:

Judith Willmott, winning 8 events and 24 points in the Junior Girls.

George Kelly who won 15 points in the Junior Boys.

Lorraine Irlam was second best for Draysey with 18 points.

Anthony Tame for Riggs won 17 points.

Janet Scriven for Steele won 16 points.

At the conclusion of the event the Headmaster Mr M.W. Scriven announced there would be a special Swimming Cup to be held from year to year by the house winning the carnival and to be known as the Roy Jeffery Cup, as a tribute to the former headmaster whose efforts had done so much to provide the Burra Swimming Pool.

Burra Town Council recently approved a plan for the beautification of the creek area near the swimming pool.  A committee of Messrs Baulderstone, W. Lloyd, Cummins and Fullgrabe were elected to investigate and report to Council.

The plan was accepted and work will begin in the winter months.  The plan covers both sides of the creek from the new footbridge to the Jubilee Fountain.  [A very rough plan of the area is printed.]

Between the bridge and the dressing sheds the area is to be planted with lawn and shrubs – to be sustained with waste water from the pool.  Next to the toddlers’ pool will be an area 100 feet wide to be a children’s playground enclosed by a cyclone fence.  Between the playground and the present caravan park sheds the area will be developed as a car park.

On the eastern side of the pool and playground a strip will be planted with lawns and shrubs beneath the large gums with barbecues to be built.

Near the old fountain a natural vehicle entrance presents itself, giving access to the car park, pool and barbecue area.

Only two or three old and dangerous pines would have to be removed and some other trimming would be required.  A new block of conveniences is to be erected near the present caravan park entrance.  The old type of conveniences presently in use would be removed.  The whole area from the car park to the fountain would be ideal for a caravan park.  The eastern bank of the creek is to be planted with trees and shrubs; perhaps on school arbor days.

Wool Pavilion Donations.  The total cash so far has been £249-12-0, but there have been fleeces and a bag of wool as well.

Miss Valerie Terry was farewelled in the Kooringa Methodist Sunday School Hall on Friday 26 February.  Entertainment took the form of games, items and competitions and was organised by the MYF.  Mrs M. Satchell sang, Mr J. Carpenter gave a guitar performance, Mrs J. Carpenter sang, Miss V. Williams performed a piano solo and Miss K. Webster a piano accordion solo.

The Leighton Ladies’ Committee held its annual meeting in Leighton Hall on 24 February.  Mrs F. Carmody gave the annual report, which mentioned a Saturday night dance, Mid-winter Ball, afternoon teas at football matches and a fete.  The fete raised £46-2-0, which was given to the Burra Hospital Fundraising Committee.  £148 had been given to the Leighton Hall Committee to renovate the kitchen and supper room.  All meetings had been poorly attended, but people turned up for the events.  Thanks were tendered to the ladies of the Ironmine Methodist Ladies’ Guild for help at the fete and in making new supper room curtains.  Financially they were in credit £120-14-6.  No member could accept nomination as President, so a motion was passed calling for a special meeting on 5 April and resolving that if no nominees come forward the committee would be disbanded.

Burra RSL held its AGM on Saturday 20 February.  Only 26 members attended.  Elected: President, G.J. Kelly; Vice-Presidents, T. Rogers & E.C. Pietsch; Secretary, R.W. Fullgrabe and Treasurer, Ron Wuttke.

President E.C. Pietsch reported on a successful year with a farewell visit by the Governor Sir Robert George, a successful Annual Smoke Social and Ball and two lectures.  The Anzac day Service was conducted by the Ministers’ Fraternal and the Port Pirie Pipers’ Band led the march.  The Christmas Party was combined with the Air Force Association.  Successful Badge Days were held for Legacy, Poppy Day and Anzac Day Appeals.  Two Legacy wards have been maintained and £81-4-0 collected in a weekend bottle drive for this cause – a similar drive was conducted last weekend.  The front of the clubrooms has been painted without charge for labour by Messrs J. Kelly, E.C. Jones and R. Day.  Farewells were tendered to T. Brazil and Colin Morrison, who had been an able Secretary in the past year.  Bob Ford died during the year and was provided with a funeral escort.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary was thanked for their valued help.

Burra Institute

President F. Atkin presented his annual report.  Membership was steady.  About 250 new books were added to the library.  Cataloguing has been a long job, but is now nearing completion.  Circulation of books and magazines has been about 7,500 for the year.    The library holds c. 6,823 books.  Membership at 31 December was 126 adults, 35 scholarship, 18 juveniles and 1 life member for a total of 180.

The New Year began in credit £12-1-4 and ended in credit £23-2-11.

Thanks to the Town and District Councils who each gave a grant of £5.

The Government subsidy of £50 is vital for the continuation of the Library.  £63 was spent on books, freight, insurance, repairs and sundries.  £120 for the Librarian’s salary and £40 on magazine subscriptions.  Subscriptions bring in £135, so the need for grants, subsidies and money raising efforts is obvious.

Obituary.  Rev. David George Longbottom of Burra was born at Jamestown in 1904 [30 November] and died on 22 February after a short illness.  He was a member of the Ironmine Church before joining the Methodist ministry 34 years ago.  He began as a home missionary at Darke Peake Home Mission Station.  He studied at Wesley College and obtained highest results in the Commonwealth in Hebrew and Greek.  He was a humble and conscientious person, possessed of quiet persuasiveness and he won the confidence and support and affection of young people.  He loved astronomy and only recently vacated the chair as Master of Epworth Masonic Lodge.  He is survived by his widow and daughter Joan.  [The death is registered as 27 February at Prospect, residence Manningham.  He is apparently ‘of Burra’ because his parents had a property at Braefoot when he was young.]

Obituary.  V.T.L. Hughes of Mt Bryan East died suddenly on 8 March aged 69, while attending to stock.

Mrs Colin Hughes and her little girl were the only ones at home at the time.  Mr Hughes came to Mt Bryan East about 1907 to work for Messrs Thomas & Gare at Glen View and after a number of years he purchased a small holding and went share farming.  Owing to low wheat prices he sold his farming plant and took casual work as his holding was far too small to make a living on.  He has erected many miles of fencing in the district and up to a few weeks of his death was still engaged in that laborious work.  He was a loyal member of the Mt Bryan East Methodist Church and was a regular worshipper until the church closed a few years ago.  He was a life member of the Mt Bryan East Agricultural Bureau.  He was buried at Hallett Cemetery.  Mrs Hughes predeceased her husband in July 1950.  Six children survive: May Mrs Williams of Wallaroo, Aileen Mrs Modra of Gawler District, Albert of Adelaide, Jean Mrs Don Kessel of Kadina and Colin and Levi both of Mt Bryan East.

[Victor Thomas Levi Hughes born 1 June 1890 at Wonna: died 8 March 1960 Mt Bryan East.]

Mr R. Fuss was made an honorary life member in recognition of his untiring support and help with the show improvements.

Burra Rural Youth was acknowledged for helping improve buildings and to run Gala Night Dance and assisting with finance.

President’s Report

Despite the drought the annual show on 10 October 1959 was an outstanding success.  The show was officially opened by Sir Philip McBride KCMG.

The weather was glorious and over 2,000 people attended.

Entries were just short of a record.

The main ring events were good and horses numerous.

A Sanction Dog Show attracted much interest and it was pleasing to see the sheep pavilion comfortably full.

The Rural Youth Sheep Judging Competition was a popular innovation.

Wool entries were well supported, causing congestion in the Agricultural Pavilion.

This prompted the decision to find new accommodation for wool and a new building is being erected for this purpose.  Mr R. Fuss has come forward to help the society erect this building and for this we are most grateful.

The Rural Youth have also been most helpful this year with financial aid and looking after Gala Night arrangements.

Membership remains over 300, a gratifying level and our financial position is sound.

With regret I note the passing of Mr A.T. McWaters, one of our staunchest committeemen, who gave untiring energy to the society.

We thank our secretary Mr T.G. Perry and Miss Hopkins for their assistance and to all those who served on committees or helped in other ways.

The Burra Racing Club’s meeting on Wednesday last was conducted in perfect weather and proved to be the best in the history of the club.  Starting stalls were used for the first time in Burra and proved most successful.

Accident/Obituary.  Brian Kenneth Baulderstone, a 19-year-old apprentice carpenter of Firle, was killed near Hanson on Saturday night when the car he was driving overturned.  The car was a Holden sedan and his mother Mrs Nellie Margaret Thompson was a passenger.  They had intended to stay at Burra overnight before proceeding to Terowie the next day.  The noise of the crash was heard by Messrs Barry Eberhard, Kevin Lane and John Bray who were in the area.  When they arrived the car was back on its wheels, but the occupants had been thrown out.  The ambulance and Burra Police were summoned and Mrs Thompson was admitted to Burra Hospital with shock and severe bruising.  The driver was dead when examined by Dr R.B. Pitcher.  Brian and his mother were to have attended the Prize Shoot at Terowie on Sunday.  Other members of the East Marden Club did not learn of the fatality until they arrived at Terowie the next day.  Although the shoot continued the East Marden members withdrew.

The Methodist Quarterly Meeting was held at Redruth on Thursday 7 April.  A resolution was carried that a letter be sent to the Burra Council protesting against permission for the use of the Aberdeen Tennis Courts for organised Sunday sport.

The Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline will be duplicated, with work starting this year.  The proposals for the year ending 31 December are for new pumps for numbers 1, 2, 3 & 4 pumping stations between Morgan and Robertstown and for booster stations at Spalding, Georgetown, Baroota and Lincoln Gap.  The 1961 works include a major pumping station and a 33-inch concrete-lined steel main to Bald Hill, two miles northwest of Burra and a summit storage of 2 million gallons.  The pumping station at Hanson is planned to lift 12,000 gallons per minute to the Burra tanks and three of a probable four pumping units are listed for early installation.

The Burra to Jamestown section will start in 1962 and will continue through 1963.  Jamestown to Wirrabara commences in 1964 and Wirrabara to Baroota in 1965.  Later the rising main from Morgan to Hanson will be duplicated as will also the main from Baroota to Whyalla.  The total cost will be £12,237,000 and the work will not be completed till 1985.

The Bald Hill storage tanks will be located where the Hundreds of Ayers, Hanson and Kooringa join west of Burra.  From the Burra Tanks the main will pass through the Hundred of Ayers to Booborowie, passing just north of the town and assuring it of reticulated water.  It will then trend northwest through Ayers and almost due north through the Hundred of Reynolds, then northwest to appoint almost due south of Jamestown, where ultimately there will be four 2 million gallon tanks.  Then it will go northwest in an almost direct line to Caltowie and on to Wirrabara, through Germein Gorge to meet the existing main.  Burra should receive Murray water in 1962.

These details from P.H. Quirke MP.

Kooringa Methodist Ladies’ Guild held its AGM early in March.

A hole in the netting of Gully’s Wharf Bridge [i.e. the Burra North Swing Bridge] is to be repaired.

A previous motion had been passed to have the name of E.R. Davey removed from the Town Clerk’s Honour Roll.

Crs Fisher and Cornelius moved to have all names removed, as those concerned had been paid servants.  Carried.

[Given that the roll is still there in the Town Hall in 2014, this resolution does not appear to have been put into effect.  See also comment at 90, 3, 26 January 1960, page 1.]

Resolved that a carpet runner be obtained for the dress circle stairways and from the doorway to the stage in the main hall.  Quotes were of £59 and £35.  Also that winding gear be obtained for masking the screen for pictures.  Quote £48.  Carried.

Elected: President, Dr L.G. Miller; Vice-Presidents, Messrs M.V. Scriven & J. Murray; Secretary, T.M. Richardson and Treasurer, R.B. Jennison.

Early last season the committee decided to invite the associates to nominate two delegates to attend committee meetings so that associates’ interests could be represented on club matters concerning them.  This has proved most successful.  The club began the season in credit £271-8-11 and spent £287-3-7 on extensions to the clubhouse and other capital items and £145-6-11 for course improvements and weekly labour.  It finished the year in credit £70-0-10.  The new season will start on 30 April.

The Bishop of Pt Pirie, Rev Dr Bryan Gallagher will visit Burra next weekend.  He will probably attend the St Joseph’s School Physical Culture Display and Sports Day on Saturday afternoon and on Sunday will administer confirmation at St Joseph’s Church.

Burra Ambulance Service

Following the withdrawal of the privately owned ambulance, which has operated in the district for some time, a meeting has been called to discuss the possibility of buying a District Ambulance.  The withdrawal of the ambulance without notice came as a shock to the town’s doctors.  The Mayor was notified on Monday night, but before he could notify those affected, Dr Pitcher called for an ambulance to transfer a patient to Adelaide.  The doctors then discovered there was no ambulance in the town and the Clare ambulance had to be used.  A meeting will be held on 29 April.  An ambulance committee had been formed, but when the offer of a private ambulance was made its work was halted.

Telephone Facilities in Burra were disrupted on the Thursday before Easter when Council employees washed out water tables while unaware that the PMG cable pits were open.  Water entered the pit in front of Elders and ran through the conduit to the pit in front of the District Council Offices.  About 150 telephones were placed out of service until the pits could be pumped out and approximately 1,200 joins were made.  Communications were restored by Friday morning.

Bowman came to Burra to speak about what was then known as the Country Women’s Service Association and soon afterwards a branch of this was opened in Burra with the Late Mrs I.J. Warnes as its first President.  Two years later the name was changed to the Country Women’s Association.  Lady Swift, the daughter of the late Mrs John Tennant, an original member, has consented to open the exhibition.

Telephone Calls

The Director of Posts and Telegraphs has announced that from 1 May the local telephone area has been greatly enlarged.  Previously the local call area for Burra extended for a circle within a radius a little greater than halfway to Mt Bryan or Hanson.  Now it will extend to Clare and Watervale in the west, to beyond Robertstown in the southeast and beyond Booborowie, Willalo and Hallett in the north.   [A map of the area is printed.]

The local call cost will be 4d.  Trunk call charges will also change.  Eleven different rates will become eight and the minimum charge will be 1/4.

A Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting was held in the Town Hall last Tuesday night.  Thirty-one people attended to hear the report of the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone. [They are listed.]

Mr Baulderstone expressed his disgust at the attempt by some to arrange the amalgamation of the Town and District Councils.  He said he would oppose this because he did not wish to see the townspeople give away what their ancestors had fought for.  The Town Council gets much abuse about its roads, but Burra is scattered along miles of road, many of them with low rated properties.  The roads are not any worse than in other towns of comparable size, though some footpaths are not as good as they should be.  The town also has quite a number of bridges to maintain and many of them are old.

They had received quite a lot of criticism regarding the main [foot] bridge, which is now almost completed.  They had made mistakes there, but they had been rectified.

The Council has been criticised for removing street trees in some places, but they had planted many in the past five or six years.  Many old trees were unsuitable or were planted in the watertables.  I am confident that for every tree removed twenty or thirty have been planted.

Jubilee Avenue.  The row of trees planted along the creek side of the Burra North Road provides a golden opportunity for beautifying the town and providing a good caravan park area.

The War Memorial Oval is mainly controlled by its committee and they have achieved quite a lot with little public support.  A turf oval would be something to be proud of and I think should be more the responsibility of the Football Club.

The first public meeting in 1956 called for a swimming pool and by 1959 the Education Department was using the pool for its ‘Learn to Swim Campaign’.  I congratulate those few who went ahead with action and not just words.

When the Council decided to raise a loan to buy the Mine area we didn’t receive any objections.  It will cost the ratepayers little, with grazing rights offsetting much of the cost.  The area can also be controlled for rubbish dumping and road metal is available there where previously the Council had to pay a royalty for it.  In addition old mining relics can be preserved and the area developed as a tourist attraction.

With ETSA having taken over the electricity supply, there are more and brighter street lights.

Naming the streets is another idea and with gradual placement of the signs it would cost little.

The cemetery is proving a problem.  It covers a large area and finance is very limited.

Burra is getting a fair share of new buildings and the main street compares most favourably.

The Fire Station has been leased to the Fire Brigade Board for £10 p.a. for ten years with the right of renewal and the Board is now responsible for repairs and improvements, such as those being carried out at present.

The Town Hall had been allowed to get into a bad state of repair.  Until about ten years ago the hall was costing the taxpayers money.  It was then decided to operate the pictures for the benefit of the hall.  Money was borrowed to set this up and now the income has allowed the hall to prosper.  £6,000 has been borrowed for the new supper room, but it is all being paid for by the pictures.

Most of the health budget goes on scavenging.  In recent years this seems to have slipped somewhat.  I would like to see a regular fortnightly collection.  This would mean each ratepayer paying £1 p.a. for the service.

Septic tank systems will have to be mandatory within a few years.

There is now an urgent need to do something about getting a town ambulance.

Last year at the end of June the overdraft of £2,567 was too large.  This year we anticipate ending the financial year with a reduction of at least £1,000 in this.

Answers to questions revealed:

The Town Hall pictures account was in credit

The pictures had paid off the Town Hall mortgage

There is currently no special rate for garbage collection

There is only a partial list of old relics in the town

The question of amalgamation of councils has not come from the District Council

Burra Primary School Committee AGM

Mr M.G. Stockman was elected Chairman with Mr D.H. Field as Secretary-Treasurer.

Report for 1959

The staffing position was satisfactory with seven teachers for seven grades.

The highlight of the year was the visit of the Governor Sir Robert George and Lady George.

A sports day was held on the oval in lieu of a picnic.

Visiting Day was held in conjunction with the High School.

Negotiations are under way to acquire the land between the school and the Drill Hall to allow an extension of the playing area and these should be concluded shortly.

We missed out on Arbor Day due to the dry conditions.

The lunch room has been nicely furnished and the free milk system is working well.

There is still a move afoot to have an extension library in the main building, a new classroom in the yard and a new block of lavatories for Primary School use on the east side.

The latest advice from the Department is that the main school roof is to be renovated to do away with the roofing well and the box guttering – rendering many pigeons homeless and helping to keep drinking water clean.

Burra Post Office

Mr C.R. Kelly MHR cut the ribbon on Monday night 9 May to officially declare open the new Burra Post Office.  Local Postmaster Mr O. Tattersall introduced Mr Sullivan, Director of Posts and Telegraphs, who welcomed all to the ceremony.  The building was erected by Taras & Co., Builders.  The CWA ladies provided refreshments in the RSL Hall.  His worship the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone congratulated the PMG on the erection of such a suitable and up-to-date post office in Burra in an ideal situation.  Mr Quirke said he would like to see an extension of the shelter in front of the building to cover people using the private boxes.  In his speech Mr Kelly referred to the history of the town and the Burra Mine and also to the history of its post office.  A post office was established at the Mines in 1847 and the first postmaster was Mr H.M. Buswarra [sic: for H.M. Boswarva].  The town comprised five settlements: Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen, Copperhouse and Hampden [sic: for Hampton].  Kooringa was the largest and a post office was established there in 1849 under postmaster Thomas Grant.  In 1858 a peppercorn lease was granted by the mining company to the PMG’s Department.  The old stone post office is thought to have been built in 1860.  In 1942 [sic: actually on 1 December 1939] the name was changed to Burra to save confusion, since the railway station and District Council were already known by that name.  Telegraph facilities were provided at Kooringa in 1860 and a telephone exchange, with two subscribers, was established in 1911 – Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd and Bagot, Shakes & Lewis.  A telephone trunk line to Adelaide was provided on 1 April 1920.  Today there are more than 300 subscribers connected to the Burra Exchange and two rural automatic exchanges at Gum Creek and Hanson are controlled from Burra.  From 1 May last the local call service area of Burra has been greatly extended.  In the past year the Burra Post Office handled:

Postal articles	591,655

Telegrams	5,614

Trunk calls	125,281

Local calls	145,431

The new building has an area of 16,000 square feet and cost £17,500.

The old building will accommodate telecommunications equipment and the telephone exchange.  At present there are 32 people on the staff of the PMG at Burra and the present postmaster Mr O.A. Tattersall has held the position since 1950.  [Photo of Mr Kelly cutting the ribbon.]

Weather

It has been a week of fairly consistent rain, with strong gusty winds and hail and in some places snow.  Some shorn sheep and young lambs have succumbed to the conditions.  Mushrooms are plentiful.  So far in May Burra has received 539 points making 945 for the year to date.

River Murray Water

The Government Public Works Committee took evidence at Burra Town Hall on Friday concerning the supply of water to Burra and districts further north, from the duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  Representatives of Burra Town and District Councils gave evidence.  Mr Shannon MP chaired the meeting and outlines the project to supply water to Whyalla BHP Steel Works.

Part of the planning provided for large storages, the first of which is at Burra, from Hanson, planned for 1961.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone said that although Burra had a good water supply its quality was not suitable for hot water systems – especially at such places as the hospital.  Mr Shannon said that whether the supply would be all Murray water or a mixture of Murray and local water would be purely an economic decision; a shandy could be dearer than straight River Murray water.  If a shandy were chosen the ratio would be fixed.  Cr Ashby (Hallett DC) said Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie had no permanent water supply.  Their elevation could prove troublesome and expensive.  He felt that a special rate to cover supply costs would probably be acceptable – though ratepayers had not yet been asked this.  The cost of carted water at Terowie was presently 25/- per 1,000 gallons.  Mr Shannon said landowners along the area within one mile either side of the pipeline would be rated whether they used the water or not.  Mr Shannon also thought that landowners a couple of miles away would not be denied access if they laid their own pipes.  Burra will definitely be supplied.

The event was opened by Lady Swift who is the daughter of Burra CWA’s foundation Vice-President, the late Mrs John Tennant.  The funds raised will be spent on a CWA building to be erected on land given by the Warnes Family in memory of the late Mary Jane Warnes, Burra Branch foundation President.  Mrs H. Jennison moved the vote of thanks.  The SA National Gallery provided 14 pictures, the Advertiser gave screens, Myers donated carpets and John Martin provided ropes and stanchions.

Burra mining days were represented by relics of mining and by pictures by Gill and Goodhart, arranged by Mrs A. Tennant assisted by Mr L. Bence.

Obituary.  Gertrude Blanche Goss was born in Burra on 4 May 1872, the eldest of six children of the late Mr & Mrs Isaac Goss.  Her father was a carpenter and builder, who in the early days of Broken Hill Mines took his family there.  Miss Goss was an organist at one of the Methodist Churches there and it was there she met and married the late Edgar Tiver of Burra in 1895.  After marriage they settled at Oodla Wirra where Mr Tiver was a signaller for the SAR.  Mrs Tiver was organist there at the little wood and iron Methodist Church, with her own little organ, which was carried into the church for the service and is still in her home at Hallett.  Mr Tiver was the Sunday school superintendent and local preacher.  In 1904 Mr & Mrs Tiver and their three eldest children moves to the Hallett District where she lived until last year when in February she moved to Adelaide in the face of advanced age and failing health.  She died there peacefully on 10 June, leaving seven children, twenty-one grandchildren and twenty-five great grandchildren.  Her husband had died 22 years earlier.

P.H. Quirke MP writes to advise that a greatly increased demand for water at Whyalla by BHP has occasioned a change of plans in the proposed duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  As a result preparatory work has temporarily been halted.  An official statement will be issued shortly and nothing has yet been decided about any change in the role of the pipeline.  Although people who expect to receive supply are naturally concerned Mr Quirke suggests that they wait for the official statement before taking any action.

The Wheat & Woolgrowers’ Association will hold a meeting at Booborowie on Monday 1 August to choose delegates for Mid North and Central Conferences and to discuss the pipeline situation.

P.H. Quirk MP writes following the Premier’s announcement about the duplication of the Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  It is likely the new pipeline will follow the route of the original.  The first route proposed would increase the cost of the large main by £3,000,000 and incur additional pumping costs of £75,000 p.a.  Plans are being drawn up which will provide water to Burra and over the first proposed route to Booborowie.  Pipelines like the one for Burra and Booborowie are built with extension in mind.  Residents further north should waste no time in preparing a petition for water so that the pipeline is built to sufficient capacity to take future loading.

Papers from the safe were found scattered over a wide area and the safe drawer was about two miles from Hanson on the Farrell Flat Road.  The opened safe was found about a mile this side of Hanson on a side road.  The rear door of Aldam’s garage was also forced, but the burglars found nothing worth taking.

Weather.  Burra had a week of wind, hail and snow with falls recorded each day to a total of 134 points.  Thursday was bitterly cold with a heavy fall of hail followed by a light fall of snow in Burra, but heavier falls between Mt Bryan and Hallett, especially on the hills.

Burra Hospital

The annual report showed the Board managed to balance its budget for 1959-60 despite two pay rises, increasing commodity costs and a drop of 750 occupied bed days, when it was read at the meeting in Burra Town Hall on Monday 23 August.

Ratepayers contributed on the following basis:

Burra Town Council	£410

Burra Burra District Council	£1,380

Hallett District Council	£340

Robertstown District Council	£190

Chairman A.D. Radford said the fall in patient numbers meant a fall in revenue of £2,250.  Salaries and wages account for more than 50% of expenses.  The scatter of hospital buildings means more domestic staff are required.  Fees were raised in March, which will benefit the coming year.  Fluorescent lighting was installed in the Men’s and Women’s Wards, which considerably brightened up the wards and recently the hospital and Sisters’ quarters were treated for termite extermination at a cost of £150.

Lawns have been sown in front of the Wing and the Nurses and Sisters’ Home and about 30 trees planted.

[Presumably ‘Wing’ refers to the Maternity Wing.]

The Women’s Organisations have again been active and have handed over £550.  This assisted in renovations to the Sisters’ Quarters at a cost of £1,200 – for which Government subsidy has been promised.

The Hospital Auxiliary has also rendered valuable service, especially in repairing bed linen etc.

Since the close of the financial year the hospital has received a bequest of £399-15-0 from the estate of [the late Mrs Clare Ethel Gare].  This will be devoted to capital improvements and so attract a two for one subsidy.

P.H .Quirke MP writes regarding plans to extend electricity supplies over the northern part of his electorate by the single wire earth return system. (SWER)

A 33,000 V line from Jamestown to Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie is needed to serve the area north and south of such a line.  Country to the east of the Hundred of Anne is receiving supply from SWER lines radiating from the Burra system.

The Hundred on Mannanarie and part of the Hundred of Belalie north of Jamestown will be supplied from Caltowie – operations are expected to begin in March 1965.  Yongala could be supplied from this source.

The Hundred of Belalie south of Jamestown should get a service scheduled in October 1964 together with part of the Hundred of Reynolds.

Spalding stages 1 & 2 are due for commencement in 1963 with stage 3 to follow.

The Hundred of Ayers has three areas.  The Burra-Hallett scheme supplies the east and south areas and is due for completion this year.

Booborowie will serve two groups north and south of the town, scheduled for 1963 and 1964 respectively.  ETSA is currently investigating how best to provide the Hundreds of Whyte, Anne and Terowie and an answer is expected in about three months.

The Mayor reported visiting the Mine Area, the Caravan Park and the Swimming Pool with Mr Pollnitz of the Government Tourist Bureau with Councillors Cornelius and Finch and the Town Clerk.  Mr Pollnitz suggested asking the RAA to send an officer to devise a long term plan for the Caravan Park.  Mine access roads need grading and shafts need to be made safe.

It was resolved that Johnny Green be moved and consideration be given to relocation at a suitable site in the Mine Area.

A general rate of 47d in the pound was declared with a differential rate of 35d in the pound for assessments 89, 326, 568 and 577.

In the event of school crossing lights being approved the Council will support this to £50.

The Corporation will pay £50 rent for the Town Hall this year.

A price will be obtained for cyclone mesh and posts to make shafts at the Mine safer.  Up to £200 was approved for a ramp at the Mine entrance and road grading by the Burra Burra DC.

‘Burra-ite’ writes wondering why the fact that there is a bitumen road now between Adelaide and Burra is not better publicised.  In the past few months many people, including some members of Government Departments have come to Burra via Black Springs, apparently unaware that the sealed road exists.  Signage is also a problem.  At the southern entrance to the town the sign to Adelaide still points to Black Springs and on the new road near Brown’s the sign points to Broken Hill via Burra North so that traffic bypasses Burra.

The Burra Show was held on Saturday last.  The day began with windy conditions, but improved.  Gate Takings were up and entries were on a par with previous records.  The wool show was the most outstanding ever.  Official guests included the Hon. D.N. Brookman & Mrs Brookman, Sir Lyell & Lady McEwin and Mr & Mrs P.H. Quirke.

The new Wool Pavilion displayed 116 fleeces.

Mr Brookman opened the show.  [His speech is reported.]

Mr Brookman also cut a large ribbon to open the new Wool Pavilion and was presented with a key donated by Mr R. Fuss, to serve as a memento of the occasion.

The Burra Rural Youth Club greatly aided the show; firstly by providing and arranging a display of rural products in the lower pavilion and secondly by providing stewards for most sections of the show.

The club also arranged the Sheep Judging Competition and at night ran a successful dance in the Main Hall, which added £38 to the Society’s funds.  During the year the club raises funds for the Show Society and assists in the maintenance of buildings etc.

[Results are printed on pages 1 & 4.

Bowling Season Opens.  About 100 people including some 60 bowlers attended the opening of the new season by Mr J.M. Gebhardt near the Marston Memorial Entrance.  The opening marks the 40th anniversary of the Burra Bowling Club and it was thus appropriate that the son of the Club’s first President (Mr Albert Gebhardt) should have accepted the invitation to open the new season.

The Associate’s President Mrs Syd Pearce rolled the first kitty and Club Patron Mr Eddie Finch delivered the first bowl and Mrs Baulderstone raised the Club Pennant.

Burra Mayor E.T. Baulderstone announces an appeal to raise £200 for the purchase and installation of traffic lights to protect the children’s crossing between the Town Hall and the new footbridge.

Burra Amateur Swimming Club

Burra can be proud of its swimming pool, officially opened last January; four years after a small band of enthusiasts were told it was impossible.  However, the apathy displayed towards the AGM called for last Thursday suggests it may not take the next step to form a swimming club to promote swimming and diving, conduct carnivals and assist with the running of the pool so that it does not become the liability the Mayor was so anxious to avoid on the night of the public meeting of 2 March 1956.  The public is urged to attend the meeting now called for Monday 31 October to form a Swimming Club in Burra.

The Annual Catholic Fete was a most successful function with the financial results expected to eclipse previous years.

The Saddleworth Show last weekend was successful with some 2,200 attending.

Burra Rifle Club on Saturday fired the postponed match versus Eudunda.  Burra won the both the marksman’s contest and the handicap section.

Burra & District War Memorial Committee held its AGM on 26 September.

D. Halliday gave the President’s Report.

Last year in conjunction with the Burra Football Club the Committee decided to build new dressing rooms with better amenities.  The first stage has been completed.  This year the second stage was completed.  The first step was the erection of the verandah by F.M .Pearce & Sons and Don Halliday at a cost of c. £88.  The Football Club financed the concrete floors, repairs to walls and the installation of an 80 gallon hot water unit, showers and seating.  Work was carried out by Messrs James, Parker, Halliday and Hirschausen to the extent of £219.  During the year frames were made and fitted as protection for the lower windows.  E. Finch donated the required bird netting and R. Fuss carried out the work gratis.  Water pressure improved when E & WS laid a new main from Paxton Street [sic: for Terrace] to the corner of the oval.  A one inch polythene water pipe was laid across the oval to connect with this, so making provision for the watering of the oval.  Mr E. Baulderstone experimented with watering and showed that two or more sprinklers can now be used successfully.  A new scoreboard was erected.

[Of which details are given.]

Elected were: President, D.A. Halliday; Senior Vice-President, P.J. Byrnes [sic: for Byrne]; Secretary, H.E. Kowald and Treasurer, M.W. Scriven.

Redbanks Sports Day

[This report offered the first indication that the event was organised by the Small Bore Rifle Club.]

Have you ever been to Redbanks Picnic Grounds c. 10 miles east of Burra?

The Baldina Creek runs past the grounds on the south side.

The grounds are ideal for sports and barbecues.

Kookaburras are numerous and the clear running water adds to the beauty of the scene.

In the first season of the Small bore Club the purchase of the Old Drill Hall by the PMG Department forced them to remove all club gear and erect a suitable clubhouse on the range itself.  The club had and still has no funds and this activity was only possible through several persons being prepared to act as guarantors at the bank.

The [range] area has been beautified by working bees.

It is with a view to raising some money that this sports day etc. has been organised for 5 November.

Among the attractions it has been arranged for several go-karts to be present and for demonstrations of powered model aircraft.  There will be a publican’s booth and an ice cream and cool drinks stall.  Fireworks will be on sale for those wishing to join in the evening.

Burra Show

At the opening of the 86th Burra Show on 8 October the Hon. D.N. Brookman Minister for Agriculture also opened the new Wool Pavilion.

[The 1960Show was actually the 68th Show not the 86th.  The mistake arises from not deducting the years in which no show was held.]

There is no doubt the Show received a boost from the excellent wool and sheep sections.  The ability to house wool exhibits in the one pavilion helped the presentation of the other sections.

The Show Committee wish to extend their thanks to all who contributed to the success of the venture.  Many weeks of patient work on the part of Mr Fuss and members who helped him, together with the capable urging of Mr Herb. Riggs and his committee were well rewarded.

Local stores in the town contributed with the display of wool and wool products in their windows.

Also elected were: Patron, G. Stanley Hawker; Vice-President, A.L. Beinke; Secretary, Allan Ireland and Treasurer, K. Hicks.

The Club will apply for affiliation with the SA Amateur Swimming Association.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the untiring efforts of the Secretary and Treasurer of the Swimming Pool Committee Mr Ted Orchard.

The report of the Swimming Pool Committee said:

The pool was officially opened by Mr G. Stanley Hawker 31 January 1960.

Voluntary hours given to the completion of the pool were 1,154.

The formation of a swimming club affiliated with the Amateur Swimming Association would allow swimmers’ times to be recognised and would stimulate competitive swimming.

Special tribute must be paid to Mr R.G. Jeffery for his untiring effort in the initial stages of the construction of the pool and to Mr Ted Orchard for his efficiency as Secretary-Treasurer.

Snakes are quite prevalent at present.

Burra Small Bore Rifle Club

The official opening of the Small Bore Range was held on Saturday despite adverse weather conditions.  The SA and Australian Champions attended and the first possible for this range was fired by C. Lewis of Ramco over 25 yards.  About 70 people attended.  Captain of the Burra Club Mr R. Angel welcomed visitors.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone performed the official opening.  Afternoon tea followed.

Of the seven trophies being competed for on the day the SA Champion Mrs Barbara Pain won four, the Australian Champion Mr John Murphy won two and C. Lewis of the Morgan Club won one.

But as any one shooter could only claim one range trophy Mrs Pain had to concede the 75 yard trophy to V. Pfitzner of Pt Augusta West Club and she kept only the grand aggregate trophy and presented the 100 yard trophy to Mike Thomas, while the best Burra Club score in Night Aggregate went to J. Brown.

Mr Murphy retained only the afternoon aggregate trophy and gave the 50 yard trophy to Milton Mitchell.  Mr C. Lewis, who was best over 25 yards, presented his trophy to the highest Burra scorer in R. Angel.

Tuesday night’s best scorers were W. Corner, A. Angel and M .Mitchell.

Burra Town Council, 4 December

Mr Baulderstone reported on Councillors in the town receiving abuse and those in business losing trade.  People had refused to deal with Councillors’ businesses because the footbridge by the bowling green had been closed for repairs.  This was unfair on people who do a voluntary job to the best of their ability and who suffer through ratepayers who take no apparent interest in town affairs other than when something doesn’t suit them and who would not offer themselves for election to the same position.

The annual banquet arranged by the Parents & Friends’ Association was held in the Town Hall on Wednesday afternoon last.  More than 150 sat down at the tables with Mrs F.D. Arnold presiding.

Characteristics of the paper for 1960

In general there is a satisfactory coverage of local news, though the paper is beginning to carry material directly relevant to nearby towns as well.  Hallett in particular gets a considerable coverage, with District Council reports for example.  Some articles fail initially to make clear which town is being reported.

There is some evidence of careless editing with jumbled print not always being corrected in time or even referred to in the next issue so that it might be clarified.

Almost all the news except sport appears on page one.  Photographs put in an occasional appearance, but as yet remain a week at least after the event.

Sports as always get a great deal of space.  District Council reports are extensive, but not always very informative.  A long list of letters received conveys no real information.  Even an explanation that the letter concerned  a particular road or building etc. is useless if it fails to say what the concern was.

Note that this summary has generally ignored events reported from other towns in the district.

Page 1

Entirely devoted to news and photos of local event or people are not uncommon, though somewhat delayed.

Page 2

Advertisements for sales, entertainment, public notices and the like.

Page 3

Often a continuation of page 2 content with some large advertisements.

Pages 4-8

Dominated by advertisements of considerable size.  Most are two columns wide by 3 inches (7.5 cm) in depth or larger.  News here is dominated by sports results.  District Councils are also reported at length here.  CWA news is significant and the activities of the schools get good coverage.  News of any sort rarely exceeds 1½ of the 6 columns.  One page usually carried a ‘Cash Column’.  This was essentially very brief advertisements of items for sale.

Burra High School Headmaster’s Report for 1960 (The 48th Report)

Enrolment in 1960 was 122; up 6 on 1959’s record.  Only 4 left during the year.  There were 8 in the Leaving Class.

[He then goes on at some length to thank his staff, the High school Council, the Parents & Friends Association, the Ministers of Religion, bus drivers and students.]

The school has striven, beyond the resources of time and staff, to provide for the less academically capable by providing subjects outside of the matriculation route: Shorthand, Typewriting, Home Science, Needlework, Drawing and Woodwork.  Public Examination results last year were very good.  In Leaving the three students won certificates with 90% passes in subjects taken.  In Intermediate there were 14 certificates and three others with six subjects each out of the 22 entrants.  All told our students got 9 credits and a 77% subject pass rate.

Sports continue to feature with weekly house matches, a Swimming Carnival in February and an Annual Sports Day in April.  Burra was doing well with the handicap system in the Mid Northern High School Sports at Riverton in May.  At lunch we were coming second, but rain turned the oval into an impossible morass and hopes were thwarted.  Virtual flood conditions washed out the series of football and basketball matches with Clare and Balaklava.

In July the Leaving Class went to Adelaide to see Richard III and in August the Senior School and some Second Year students went to Clare to see The Merchant of Venice.  The Annual Ball in September was a highlight with record takings of £149.  An Arbor Day in July replaced Visiting Day and most of the trees and shrubs planted are doing well.  A new classroom unit was added in the year and awaits the painters, so it should be ready for use in 1961.  Acquisitions in the year have included a new refrigerator in the Home Sciences room, new floor coverings in the Library, a new motor mower, remodelling of the Library and £100 worth of books.

Adult education classes in Dressmaking and Woodwork continued.

Two items of unfinished business are the site for the new school and the issue of a Hanson bus.

[Tenders for the bus are called on page 1 of this paper.]

At the end of 1960 Miss Shirley Crouch (Home Science) goes to Adelaide and Mr Kowald to Angaston.

R.S. Norris writes commenting on an article in the Advertiser reporting comments by Mr H. Toepfer of the importing firm of Alfred Toepfer of Hamburg, who was amazed to find SA still handling virtually all its oats and barley in bags and calling for bulk handling both for efficiency and to control pests.  The need to change to bulk handling, he says, is clear.

W.V. Ford writes on returning to the town after an absence of 38 years and being dismayed to find that Aberdeen no longer exists.  He was sorry to see such a small attendance at Redruth Methodist Church.  He believed the mine area was a tourist asset going to waste.  He was glad to renew acquaintance with Jock Bernhardt, Stan Woollacott, Hedley Pearce, Cliff Turner and Sid. Scroop.  Rev. E.M. Ingamells asked to be remembered to friends.

J.R. O’Sullivan, Director of Posts and Telegraphs writes in response to a letter by R. Fuss in the paper of 13 December 1960, in which Mr Fuss thanks the Fire Brigade and others who helped extinguish the fire on his property, ‘But no thanks to the Telephone Exchange.’  Mr Fuss has refused to supply any details which would assist the department investigations into the implied failure.  There is no record of a fire call from the service of Mr Fuss.  A query was received from Burra 233 at 12.10 p.m. on Saturday 10 December asking whether the exchange had heard about the fire over the hill and the caller was connected with the Fire Officer at Burra 183 and the officer then activated the fire siren.  The postmaster also received a letter from another subscriber explaining that a call in connection with the fire from the extension telephone of his service was not effective as he had not switched the extension switch at his house to the correct position.  The postmaster has no further knowledge of the case, but should Mr Fuss care to furnish any information of the alleged failure by staff I would be pleased to have further investigations made.  In the absence of such I can only assure Mr Fuss acted under a misapprehension which unfortunately has brought unwarranted discredit on the exchange staff.

Obituary.  Mrs M.A. Jefferies late of Burra died 27 January at her residence in Colonel Light Gardens aged 92 [93].  She came to Burra in 1870 with her parents and spent all her girlhood in the town.  She went first to Mr Kat’s School and later to the Public School.  Her father, the late Mr Simpson, we believe drove the first train from Burra to Hallett when the line ended there.  When refreshment rooms were opened at Burra Mr & Mrs Simpson had charge of them.  Later they took the refreshment rooms at Hamley Bridge and it was there she met and married Albert Jefferies, who was in the SAR.  After the marriage they moved to Wallaroo for five years and then to Adelaide.  Mr Jefferies then left the railways and they ran a shop at Reynella.  In 1912 they purchased a farm at Mt Bryan and were there until Mr Jefferies died.  Mrs Jefferies then moved to Burra with her daughter Joyce and in 1956 to Adelaide where her three daughters reside.  She is survived by her three daughters and one son as well as ten grandchildren and sixteen great-grandchildren.  Mr Frank Jefferies still lives on the farm.

Grain Silos.  Tenders have been called for the erection of a 300,000 bushel silo at Farrell Flat.  A meeting of about 200 local wheat growers at Hanson on Wednesday failed to convince the Chairman of the Bulk Handling Board that Hanson was a more central point.  It is understood that growers in the Gum Creek-Farrell Flat area would fill the silo before growers further north and east would start reaping, as they are normally 2-3 weeks later.

After Farrell Flat, the next silo planned is at Pt Pirie with 16 cells.  It is expected erection of a complete coverage of silos throughout the state will take at least four years.

Public Meeting on Decentralization

Thirty-four people attended the public meeting at the Burra Town Hall on 20 February.  The meeting was to pass on suggestions about industry for the town.  With population dwindling what could be done in Burra was the question.  The Mayor’s own suggestion was the concrete trade – posts and bricks, many of which are used in the district and further north.  Another suggestion was crushed metal and another the development of mineral resources within the ‘Eastern’ country. Other suggestions touched on meat works and a cannery, Mongolata goldfield, clay, pottery and bricks and small scale machinery.  Questions of cheaper electricity and water were raised and the question was asked about how much and whether the Government would pay for decentralization.

Burra High School.  A successful Swimming Carnival was held on 24 February.

‘Regular Sufferer’ writes complaining of power outages since ETSA took over.  The Editor says ETSA has informed them that recent failures have been due to lightning strikes on a new sub-station.

Ron Dewhirst writes a long letter running about 1¼ columns suggesting that following the north Eastern Football League’s decision not to admit Aberdeen to the ‘A’ Grade and to continue with a League of four teams, the best solution would be for a ‘B’ Grade competition or a Colts competition.  Two ‘A’ Grade teams is more than one town could maintain.  When he first came to the district Booborowie had three and then for several years it had two and so did Burra and Spalding, but population has fallen with young people going to the city and all three towns have difficulty fielding one strong team.  A strong competition could not have been sustained with two teams in one town.  He does not believe four teams too few for a league and most country leagues have only four teams.  He feels ‘B’ Grade would be a better solution than Colts teams.  With a Colt age limit of 18 a lad reaching 18 is deprived of a game if he is not quite good enough for the ‘A’ team.  A ‘B’ team would solve this problem (or a Colts team without age limit).  The possibility of interchange between ‘A’ & ‘B’ teams would also make ‘A’ team players look to their laurels.

Thanks are paid to the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  The annual dinner also had a small attendance.  The Christmas Party was a combined function with the Air Force Association.

Booborowie Hall Recreation Committee has undertaken a cropping project in the Booborowie Parklands for improvements to the hall and the recreation ground.  When the project began in 1959 the first season was very dry and only 21 bags were obtained and this was kept as seed.  The 1960 season was more successful and the committee was able to sell 89 bags of grade 3 and 186 bags of grade 4 as well as keeping 21 bags for seed.

[Details of who did what are printed.]  A larger area will be sown this year than the 27 acres sown last year.

[Details of working bees are given.]

As a result of the committee’s work so far a tank has been erected alongside the windmill and pipes laid to both toilets, paths have been laid and grass cleared.  At the end of the football season it is intended to grade the oval and install a cricket pitch to centralise sporting facilities.

Obituary.  Mr Michael Breen, formerly the Secretary/Manager of the Burra Hospital and Secretary of the Burra Racing Club, has died in Auckland New Zealand.  He resigned from these positions in the latter part of 1960 to return to Norfolk Island.  He had just arrived ‘home’ and was settling in when death occurred.  Earlier he had been Secretary of the Woomera Town Board for 8 years, retiring in 1958 from a position like that of a town mayor, town clerk, editor of the local paper Gibber-Gabber, supervisor of civic amenities, registrar of burials and curator of the cemetery.  He held a BEc, BA and Dip. Public Administration from Sydney University.  Mr H. Foote said Mr Breen loved his pet galah and paid a large sum of money to get it to New Zealand, but on arrival was advised that because of some technicality it could not land and he had to leave it with the coxswain of the boat.

Mr W. Butler of Burra is 85 on Saturday.

Ron Dewhirst writes about the new Mid North Football Association arrangements.  He is sorry to see so many Burra players from last year’s premiership side deserting their team instead of defending their team’s honour this year.  He maintains that Burra cannot field two ‘A’ Grade teams.  Each team needs at least 25 players to account for injuries, sickness etc.  Burra has won about three premierships in 25 years – hardly an indication it can field two ‘A’ Grade teams of the strength to repeat last year’s performance.  At any rate the new team has yet to be cleared by NEFA and as we were not recognised by the SA League last year they cannot rule over our own league.  If clearances are not granted (and he thinks they should not be) they would have to appeal to the National Council – a time consuming thing.  The players should reconsider and stick to their former team.

E.T. Baulderstone writes concerning the Burra War Memorial Oval, pointing out that neither the football nor the cricket nor any other club has any ownership of the facilities; the oval is the property of the ratepayers of Burra.  An improvement committee is appointed annually and in ten years has done a magnificent job in providing facilities with very little support from sporting bodies etc.  The next project is to improve the grassing of the oval and watering of the playing field.

He writes that the town cannot maintain more than one oval and he clearly regrets the tendency of some to drift away from the oval to play their sport elsewhere.  He calls for unity behind using the Burra Oval.

Mr W.F. Johns, formerly a Burra grazier at ‘Studholme’, has designed a special motor cycle for terrain and cross-country areas and for slow tedious mustering duties.  Produced by the Nippon Gakki Co. Ltd of Japan, they were introduced to SA stock firms last week and were demonstrated in Adelaide.  Mr Johns said the idea came to him when attending to sheep on ‘Studholme’ on unsuitable machines.  He had a knowledge of military vehicles, gained during the war.  Nippon Gakki were prepared to build machines for testing before getting larger orders.  The result is the Liberty Yamaha Ranch Model with high clearance mudguards, upswept exhaust pipes to avoid rocks etc. duplex reinforced frame and heavy duty suspension front and rear in telescopic assembly and five gears, allowing extensive use at low speeds.  Dalgety’s are the distributors.

Burra Town Council received a deputation on Monday night last week of representatives of the Burra Primary School, concerned about the dangers of crossing the main road.  The Mayor said the Council was sympathetic, but in the end the whole thing would depend on the Commissioner of Highways.  The deputation said their purpose was to get, if possible, a pedestrian crossing connecting the new bridge across the Burra Creek and the Town Hall.  The Welfare Club had sought action some time ago.  The Highways Department had inspected the area and given the distance of the crossing from the school, they could only suggest flashing lights.

It had been understood that monitors would be required, but this is not necessary on advice from the Minister of Roads, Mr Jude.  It was decided to go ahead and the Welfare Club had £200 in hand, but the Minister of Education advised that the sum could not be used for this purpose and so a move to press for a pedestrian crossing was considered.

Mr Stockman pointed out that a crossing could be used by other than school children and in the summer period by people going to and from the swimming pool.

It was pointed out that a pedestrian crossing would compel motorists to stop if any pedestrian was using the crossing, whereas flashing lights would merely warn motorists of the possibility of children crossing and slow them down to 15 m.p.h., but as the school was half a mile away motorists could not be compelled to observe the 15 m.p.h. speed limit.  It could be enforced past the playground, but that would not help much.  A pedestrian crossing could be set up by the Council with the permission of the Commissioner of Highways and it needed a prohibition of parking for 30 ft either side.

After discussion the Council decided to apply for a pedestrian crossing.

Obituary.  A memorial service was held at Willalo Methodist Church on Sunday 4 June for the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Thomas of ‘Glenburnie’ Willalo.

[The commonness of this name makes identification uncertain.  Mrs Joseph Thomas nee Marion Henderson Bryce died 4 April 1961 at Adelaide, residence Manningham and her husband may have been the Joseph Thomas who died 27 November 1957 at Northfield, residence Balaklava.]

National Heart Campaign ‘Operation Heartbeat’

Only 12 attended a public meeting in Burra called by the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone about the above campaign.  It was decided that sufficient collectors could be arranged from the CWA, Burra North Red Cross, Burra Football Club, Rural Youth and the RSL to carry out a door knock collection in the town.

Football.  Booborowie Football Club has decided to form a ‘B’ grade team and was in favour of a ‘B’ Grade team to replace the Colts competition, but realised this move would have to come from the Association.

Burra Town Hall Picture Committee has recommended that now that the loan for the purchase of the projector etc. at the Town Hall has been paid off, the income could be used for any local club or body using the Town Council property and desirous of improving their grounds or buildings.  Bodies concerned would apply to the committee for a date on a Wednesday night and profits from that night’s showing would go to the body making the application.  The Town Council has accepted the recommendation.

Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting.  Thirty attended.  The Mayor E.T. Baulderstone revealed a reduction in the Council’s overdraft from £1,200 to £300 in the last 12 months.  Record grant money had been received.  Owing to the large number of creeks in the town bridges were costly to maintain and through grant money it had been possible to reconstruct the Smelts Road Bridge and also that on the Eastern Road near Mr H. White’s.  The cemetery came in for much criticism, but care of graves was the responsibility of the people and for the paths, of the Council.

There were many parks in the town and a good beautification scheme could be submitted.  The Caravan Park is now obsolete as far as parks of today are concerned.  A plan for a new park has been adopted and it is hoped a pound for pound subsidy can be obtained for the coming year.  It had been hoped to open the mine area as a tourist spot in March or April this year, but this had not been possible.  A public meeting was called, but with only five or six people attending, it was not known whether people in the town were in favour.

Street lighting appears to be OK.  The War Memorial Committee continues to work at the oval and a new basketball court is being erected.  The Small Bore Club has improved the area on the south of the wall and thanks go to them for the effort.

The Mayor was proud of the financial care, which had reduced the overdraft from £1,200 to £300 this year.

Burra Hospital.  The cropping project is up-dated in c. ½ column.

The urgent needs at the hospital have been listed as:

Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting (Continued from last week.)

The Town Hall has not deteriorated and in the past twelve months 100 chairs have been purchased and the main aisle and stairways have been carpeted.  Through a legacy it was possible to completely redecorate the stage.  Overall the pictures have held their own despite television and they are still doing a wonderful job towards the finances.

On the health front the collection of refuse is more satisfactory than in the past.

The ambulance service is running smoothly.

The Mayor expressed his concern of the way that he and other Councillors in business have been penalised for doing ‘something for nothing’ in the Council.  He had been in business in Burra for 30 years and in Council for 15.  He expressed bitterness at the attitude of the people concerned, but whatever he did in Council would not affect him in the future as he was retiring from his Market Square business on 30 June.  He expressed concern at the lack of interest in Council elections.  On numerous occasions ratepayers had not even arranged to see that their ward was represented.  He expressed his thanks to the retiring Councillors.

[There were apparently many questions posed and answered, but not reported in the paper.]

Mr H.J.B. Jennison moved the vote of thanks to the Mayor, Mayoress and Councillors and said it was a thankless job.

Burra CWA had a proud day on Friday 30 June when its new Rest Rooms were opened in memory of the late Mary Warnes.  Before this the branch has never owned their own rooms.  A large crowd gathered in Chapel Street for the opening and 15 of the 16 branches in the Warnes Group were represented.  Seven other branches were also represented. Seven foundation members of Burra branch were present: Mesdames

H. Wardle	G. Leaney	A.T. McWaters

E. Jettner	A.L. Kellock	__ Hogan Sen.

A. Marchant

The Mayor and Mayoress of Burra and the Architect Mr H.M. Jackman & Mrs Jackman were among the official guests.  Burra President Mrs H.J.B. Jennison welcomed the guests and said the rooms had been erected as a memorial to Mary Warnes as founder of the CWA in SA.  The Burra Branch had never had a home of its own, though it had had many ‘homes’ including the Town Hall where they had been very happy.  At the last AGM it was decided it was time to build a home of their own.  The site chosen was judged ideal, close to the shopping area.  Negotiations commenced with Mr L. Gordon and at that stage the Warnes Family presented the branch with the necessary finance to make the purchase.  Considerable funds were on hand and a building committee was formed.  When a likely looking plan had been developed Mrs A. Tennant arranged with Mr Jackman to draw up the plans at no cost to the branch.  The tender of A.L. Clode and Son was accepted for the construction and portions of it were sub-let.  The building was due for completion by 20 June and the opening was hurried a little because Mrs Dolling and Mrs Tennant were going away in early July.  Furnishings etc. were not quite completed.  Mrs Dolling was called on to perform the opening and in doing so recalled the youthful experiences of Mrs Warnes, who had learned the meaning of loneliness and formed a desire to form the CWA in SA, having read of its work interstate.  Now 80 Rest Rooms are owned by the CWA and many more are rented throughout the state.  Mr Rex Warnes said it was a proud moment for him as he unveiled the plaque in memory of his mother.  An inspection of the interior was followed by afternoon tea.

[Five photographs are printed:

Burra & District Ambulance covered 6,400 miles in the past year.  65 patients were conveyed to hospital of which 16 went to Adelaide.  Membership was 379 in 1960, but so far only 213 in 1961.  Present credit balance is £600.  The annual meeting last week attracted only 7 members!

Weather.  Burra received 117 points in the past week, but rain did not extend far to the east.  65 points fell at Mongolata, but only 20 at Glenora.

Pascoe’s Barber Shop has closed after 73 years.  In 1888 the late R.D. Pascoe began business in the shop now occupied by Messrs R.A. Bevan & Son and later moved to a portion of that now occupied by Bence’s Ltd.  In 1910 the premises now housing the Burra Radio & Electrical Service were taken over and one portion used as a barber shop and the other as a newsagency.  It was at this time that Mr J. (Joe) Pascoe commenced his trade with his father and brother, the late Mr Claude Pascoe.  Another brother, Frank, ran the newsagency and the late Mr O. (Twist) Ockenden was in charge of a branch of the saloon at Aberdeen.  In 1946 following the death of Mr R.D. Pascoe ‘Joe’ carried on the business on his own until five or six weeks ago when ill health caused him to retire and close the hairdressing section of the business.  One interesting feature, which has gradually faded over the years, was the pigeonholes of shaving mugs and brushes.  Years ago the business formed a Shavers’ Club with a membership fee of one shilling a week.  Each member had his own mug and brush in one of the pigeonholes and for the one shilling fee he would be shaved as often as he presented himself during the week.  At one stage there were 184 mugs and brushes.  Going back a year or two ‘Joe’ said haircuts were 6d and shaves 3d and with three chairs in operation it would have been a quiet Friday to have fewer than 40 shaves to do.  Joe still has the razor he used when he first commenced work and though considerably worn down, it could still be used today.  All this has changed with the advent of the safety razor and later the electric razor.  Another well known feature was the collection of sheep photos, which covered the entire four walls.  The collection dates back to 1910 when the late Mr L. Gebhardt of Mokota brought in the first photo to hang in the shop.  Other stud breeders followed suit and after a time it amounted to a very fine collection indeed.

Hallett Red Cross held its AGM and elected: President, Mrs R. Honan and Vice-Presidents, Mrs Owen-Smyth, Mrs J. Murray and Mrs R. Nutt.

Weather.  175 points of rain fell for the week and were a wonderful boost for crops and pastures.  The 110 points overnight on Saturday/Sunday tested gutters and drains.  Some light snow was reported from several places on Sunday.  The rain did not extend to the east.

Burra High School.  Burra went to Riverton and Clare for lightning sports carnivals last Wednesday, which were played in continuous rain.

Football.  In the North Eastern Association the leading goal-kicker for the season was J. Brooks of Hallett with 41.  The best for Burra was B. Eberhard with 28 – ranking 6th overall.

Despite this 96 players paid the fee and entered the event, though not all ventured beyond the Club House.  The Treasurer was probably the happiest person on the day, with £70 to bank and some rain insurance money to come.

Booborowie Robbery.  A possible clue to the robbery of Dinham Bros. at Booborowie is the finding of oxy-acetylene cutting equipment and a cash box near Porter’s Lagoon. The oxy equipment was stolen from the SA Harbour’s Board at Pt Adelaide about a month ago.  Investigation continues.

Basketball Court.  A meeting at the Burra Town Hall on Thursday night considered floodlighting for the basketball court and the Memorial Oval.  It is believed the cost would be about £150-£200.  As most players were juniors it was thought it would be unfair to expect them to raise the funds and therefore the help of outside bodies and persons would be appreciated.  One generous sponsor has offered £150 on loan for 12 months, interest free to enable the work to be completed as soon as possible.   A committee has been established.

Burra Golf Club.  Stan Longford retained his ‘A’ Grade Championship on Sunday when he defeated Jim Minchin.  Four members went to Eudunda for their open day.  Roly Barnes won the ‘A’ Grade 27-hole Handicap.  Ray Jennison won the 18-hole Stableford.  The Burra Team of R. Barnes, R. Jennison & Clutterbuck won the teams’ event.

Football.  The Burra Record Trophy for 1961 goes to John Dewhirst of Booborowie.  He also won it in 1959.  He came second to Keith Warrior of Hallett for the Mail Medal for 1961.  [The Mail Medal voting is printed.]

Burra Hospital Annual Meeting 28 August

R.K .Pearse presented a comprehensive report.

Financially for the year the average daily cost per in-patient £4-1-0 (£4-5-7 in 1959-60) and for out-patients was 17/-.  Prompt payment of accounts attracts a rebate of 5/- per day and this has proved attractive.  No payment of accounts is the Board’s greatest difficulty and the Board urges all to join a Hospital Benefits Scheme.

During the year there were 428 patients, which averaged 11.9 compared with 11 in 1959-60.  There were 692 out-patients and 67 births.  The hospital greatly benefits from support of the community and a list of donations received is attached.  This year we are particularly grateful for a bequest from the estate of the late Clare Ethel Gare of £399-15-0.  The cropping program reached 90 acres despite a late start and we are grateful to all concerned.  We hope to double or treble this next year.  [Mr Pearse then lists a host of minor repairs and improvements.]

The use of the town’s hard water has a very detrimental effect on the hot water system and the boiler had to be replaced.  The Board decided to install a 50,000 gallon tank to catch all rain water, increasing the capacity to 130,000 gallons and this has been completed and will enable the usage of rain water only in the hot water system, which weekly uses 2,500 gallons.  Major improvements planned are air-conditioning in the Nursery, a new switchboard and rewiring of the hospital.  (Already commenced.)  Also, modernisation of the laundry, a toilet in the domestic quarters, a buzzer system and improvements to the grounds.

Staffing has improved and Matron L. Fyfe has proved very efficient and co-operative and we are lucky to have someone of her conscientiousness and ability.  The Board expresses its appreciation of all nurses and domestic staff.  Last December Mr M .Breen BA BEc Dip PA, who had been our secretary/manager for 18 months and who was responsible for putting our books in order, resigned to retire to Norfolk Island and it was with deep regret that we learned of his death only two months later.  Mr Harold Foote was appointed secretary/manager and has the full confidence of the Board.

The Ladies’ Auxiliary continues to give valuable assistance and the hospital is indebted to them.  The Burra & District Fund Raising Committee has been active and handed over cheques to the value of £459.  We are also thankful for the Burra Record for making available space for publicity for the hospital.

Burra Racing Club held its AGM and discussed the need for more members when only two members other than the committee attended.  Elected: Patron, Andrew Tennant; President, Mr G. Gask.  [Photo printed.]

Many district residents have been circularised and issued with membership tickets and the committee hopes for greater district support.  The President said he was concerned about the deficit of £205, but hoped with fewer expenses this year the situation would improve. The smaller clubs generally were finding it hard to carry on and Burra is unfortunate in being too far away to draw horses from either the northern areas or from the Upper Murray.  The situation for Burra is not the best.   It is hoped to have the Northern Racing Association’s mobile starting gates at the March meeting.  There are 96 nominations for the September meeting.

Burra Show 1961

The very successful show for 1961 was opened by Mr R.C. Gosse, President of the Royal Agricultural Society.  Despite entries being down in some sections, the total of 2681was a record.  The tractor driving competition, tried for the first time, created much interest.

The weather was a little warm, but nearly perfect.

Sideshows were disappointingly few this year because there were eight shows on the same day.  The tiny tots, as a result, were not really catered for, except for pony coach rides.

There were some excellent displays in the Industrial Stands, though overall fewer than last year.

The ring events as usual kept the interest till late afternoon.

Gate takings amounted to £241.

[Personal interest: At the opening there was an apology from Mr R. Fuss, a member of the Committee.]

Mr Rex Warnes, as President of the Burra Show, asked Mr Gosse to open it.  Mr Gosse commented on hoe important Burra had been in the past with copper, but now it was rather the gold of the Golden Fleece.  The district has become renowned as the cradle of the SA Merino Industry.  He regretted that all too few of the district’s fleeces were entered in the Royal Adelaide Show and hoped for better in the future.

The Tractor Driving Contest was the first to be held at a country show in SA.  The winner was R. Gillett with 99 points, followed by Les Warnes with 97 – in the fastest time of 3 minutes 14 seconds.

In photography the best black and white entry was by Rev. R.S. Jenner and the best colour transparency by K. Horsnell.

In poultry the Grand Champions Bird of the show was exhibited by R.D. Hall.

Champion Budgerigar was by M. George.

There was a good display of Jerseys in the cattle section.

Champion Cow: M.C. Garrard.  Champion Bull: D.C. Rowley.

In Cooking the aggregate points prize went to Mrs F.C. Stolte.

In Flowers the Champion Pansy was entered by C.R.E. Simon.

Burra Mine Area opened as a Tourist Resort

On Friday a large gathering of local and district residents attended the opening of the Burra Mine area as a Tourist Resort by Mr P.F. Pollnitz, Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau.  It took place at the gate on the eastern side of the mine area.  Also present were the Town Mayor & Mrs Baulderstone and Mr P.H. Quirke MP with Mrs Quirke.  The Burra Town Clerk Mr R.W. Fullgrabe introduced the Mayor who welcomed guests.  The Mayor said the Council had brochures printed giving a brief history of the Mine and its workings, to give visitors an idea of what they were inspecting.  In 1845 the Burra Mine had prevented SA from going bankrupt and the importance of this fact makes it essential that every effort be made to preserve these old workings.  Ex-Councillor H.C. Cummins had first suggested ‘selling’ the mine to visitors as a tourist resort, but up to that time not much thought had been given to the idea and the Mine had mainly been used as a rubbish dump site.  Mr Baulderstone said he soon fell in with the idea, as he realised what a wonderful venture it could prove.  Later he had the opportunity of showing Mr Polnitz over the site and from his enthusiasm had been much heartened.  The response to a public meeting to discuss the matter was disheartening, but he and his Councillors had battled on and though they had aimed to open it in March, it had not been ready until now.  He thanked former Burra High School Headmaster Mr Murray scrivener for writing the history used in the brochure.  He also thanked Mr P.H. Quirke for tracing facts used in it, Mr McGrath for his reproduction of photos and Mr S. Sleader for lending the same.  The Burra Record was thanked for printing it.  There was still much to be done.

Through the efforts of Mr Rex Warnes the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society has agreed to return the Old Jinker to be preserved on the Mine Property and this would be part of the Museum collection.

Mr Pollnitz then opened the site.  He said other countries went to much more trouble to ‘sell’ their historical attractions and we should also.  Burra needed to encourage people to stay in the town to see the attractions.  He would encourage the formation of a museum as mentioned by the Mayor.

Mr Quirke moved a vote of thanks and spoke of the amount of information and other material available for such a museum project.  [Photo of the Mine in working condition: probably taken in 1869 just before conversion to open cut operation.]

Burra Swimming Pool.  The session by Mr Ern Reddaway was well attended.  He lectured on training and swimming styles and later on individual coaching.

Obituary.  The body of Mr Bert Schultz, late of Eudunda, was recovered by the Police Aqua Lung Squad from the River Murray near Bryant’s Creek on Sunday morning.  [In 1978 this creek near Morgan was renamed Bryan Creek.]

[Bertram Albert Schultz born 30 November 1905 Kapunda: died 19 November 1961 Morgan, residence Somerton.]

Burra Camera Club.  Mr John Mack of Adelaide visited the club on 24 October and showed coloured movies of his trip around the world.  There are plans for a photographic exhibition involving six clubs in the Mid North to be held in Clare Town Hall 13 April 1962.

Remembrance Day was commemorated in Market Square with wreaths laid by Mr H. Cornelius (President Burra RSL), W. Young (for the Air Force Association), Mayor E.T. Baulderstone for the Town, M.T. Kellock for the Burra Burra District Council and Mr Dan O’Brien for the Pensioners’ League.

Weather.  In the latter part of last week general rains of one to more than three inches were recorded.  Examples of totals: Sturt Vale 152 points, Quondong 107, Mt Bryan East up to 360, Hogback 338, Woolgangi 292, Koomooloo 186 and Burra 240.

Joan Hanlin of Clare writes wondering if there is anyone who was born in Burra earlier than her mother who was 96 in July.  Her father was Captain Roach.  [Elizabeth Tuck, the wife of Alfred Robert Tuck, was born 18 July 1865 at Burra Mine to James and Mary Roach (nee Dunstan) and she died 9 September 1962 at North Adelaide.]

A Record Merino Ram Price of 9,000 guineas was achieved at the Perth Ram Sales.  The Record quotes a London paper as saying: ‘In Australia it is possible to pay more for one sheep than for a Rolls Royce.’

[It is typical of the reporting style of the paper at this stage that the article doesn’t say who sold the ram, though the headline presumably reveals it: ‘Such is Fame … Collinsville – Rolls Royce’.

Hallett CWA celebrated International Day on 28 November when the guest speaker was Mrs Owen-Smyth.

Llewellyn Herbert Piggott of Porter’s Lagoon had a party on 19 November to celebrate his 90th birthday.  He was born at Watervale in 1871 to Richard and Eliza Piggott.  His parents settled at Clarendon in 1853 and about 1869 moved to Watervale where Richard Piggott was employed on property associated with the names of Duncan and Hughes.  Some of his children attended Stanley Grammar School established by Mr Coles.  In 1875 the family moved by wagon to Morchard where virgin land was taken up.  Here Herbert began farming with his father and continued when he and his parents moved to Booleroo Centre about 1892.  His father died in 1895 and in 1904 Herbert married Annie, eldest daughter of Richard and Christina Dunstan of Booleroo Centre.  He and other farmers of the area carted their wheat through picturesque Telowie Gorge to Port Germein – some 29 miles.  In 1911 he and his family moved to Porter’s Lagoon where he has resided ever since.  His two brothers and three sisters all lived to be over 80, but are now deceased: Robert (Wistow), Sidney (Lameroo), Mrs Sanders (Booleroo Centre), Mrs Nancarrow (Glenelg) and Mrs Sargent (Crystal Brook).  Of his seven children, five survive: Bert (Porter’s Lagoon), Tom (Clare), Myra Mrs Ross Reed (St Georges), Elvy Mrs Glen Krummel (Eudunda) and Lily Mrs Henshaw (Ormond, Melbourne).  Mabel and Jean are deceased.  Some 70 people attended the celebrations and Mrs Piggott responded capably on behalf of her husband.  [He died 15 June 1964 Riverton, residence Farrell Flat and his wife died 28 April 1972 at Clare aged 92.]

Burra Town Council, 4 December

Sgt F. McGrath discussed parking problems in Burra.  He was particularly concerned with the area of the Burra Town Hall to the Telephone Exchange when functions were held.  Here cars are parked on the western side and ranked on the eastern side, which seriously narrows the road, which is only 43 ft wide and as the main road to Broken Hill it carries heavy transports.  Parking too close to corners is another problem and he recommends painting lines on the areas 15 ft from the building alignment where parking is prohibited.  Traffic islands in Market Square as proposed by the Highways Department would be a good idea.

Characteristics of the paper in 1961

In a number of ways it is disappointing.  Coverage extends to Spalding and Riverton, so there is less on Burra, but that is not the principal concern.  Articles frequently fail to identify which town they are about, at least not until you are well into them.  An example is an article headed ‘Swimming Pool Competition Completed,’ which does not indicate it is about Riverton until almost half a column into the report.  Another example informs us that Mrs King has been appointed a Senior Assistant without telling the reader at which school.

Typographical errors with jumbled lines, incorrect spacing or omitted words or lines are all too common.

Most of the news (other than sport) is on page one and photographs are a welcome, if occasional, addition.  Some news extends to other pages, but sport dominates there, though even the sport is not consistently reported.

The CWA gets particularly good coverage and as usual football is extensively reported.  Coverage of other sports is not very consistent; no doubt reflecting the inconsistency of the clubs’ publicity officers.  District Council meetings are generally well covered, but little of the information is of interest at this distance in time.

A sitting Councillor died without comment in the paper.

A welcome feature was the inclusion of some local photographs, though they were a week or two after the event by the time the plates got back for printing.

Note that this summary has generally ignored events reported from Riverton, Spalding or Saddleworth.

Page 1

Entirely devoted to news and photos of local event or people are not uncommon, though somewhat delayed.

Page 2

Advertisements for sales, entertainment, public notices and the like.

Page 3

Often a continuation of page 2 content with some large advertisements.

Pages 4-8

Dominated by advertisements of considerable size.  Most are two columns wide by 3 inches (7.5 cm) in depth or larger.  News here is dominated by sports results.  ‘The Christian Message’ is a regular column of fluctuating size.  CWA news is significant and the activities of the schools get good coverage.  News of any sort rarely exceeds 1½ of the 6 columns.

Burra High School.  49th Headmaster’s Report

[Three photos are printed of Staff, Prefects and House Leaders and Magazine Editors.]

Mr Mueller reported an enrolment of 125 (75 boys and 55 girls, a few more than in 1960.  This number is unlikely to grow in the future with now 72 in Grade VI and 76 in Grade V, but 64 in Grade IV and 62 in Grade II.

In 1961 there was a big turnover in staff with 9 changes, including part-time staff:

New were: Miss N. Lawes (S.M.), Mr R. Hillman, Mr B. McElroy, Mrs J. Bogisch (0.6), Miss E. McCabe (0.2), Mr K. Horsnell & Mr R.V. Mueller.  Mr J. Sladden & Mr K. Hicks were the only staff to carry on from 1960.

Religious Instruction has functioned smoothly throughout the year.

About 70 people attended the prefects’ induction in March.

The most urgent need for the school is improved playing grounds and the High School Council has been most supportive in plans to implement this.

The Department has offered £10 annually towards the use of the Town Oval.  In the year two fresh water tanks were installed and a new clothesline was erected.  154 steel chairs were obtained for the assembly hall.  A new Banda duplicating machine has been procured and linoleum was laid in the Needlework Room.  Anew lathe was obtained for the Woodwork Centre.  Most desks have been planed and varnished (and various other minor matters attended to.)

Six students gained Leaving Certificates and Trenna Eberhard & Merle Wickes won Commonwealth Scholarships.

11 students gained Intermediate Certificates.

Fifty children learnt to swim and 135 gained certificates.  The instructors were Mr K. Hicks, assisted by Mr P. Tattersall.  There were 50 Beginners’ Certificates, 44 Progress, 24 Junior and 17 Senior Certificates.  Bad weather forced cancellation of the carnival planned for the Burra Pool last Friday.

Geraldton Subterranean Clover has been a big success in many areas of Spalding, Jamestown and Burra Districts.  It has outclassed Dwalganup.  Its low growth is a drawback in weedy paddocks.  It thrives in areas with 16-19 inches of rain and is more lime tolerant than Dwalganup.

Burra RSL.  Annual Report of President H. Cornelius

Members have not given the club the support needed for it to continue.  A few willing members who are overworked are making all the effort.  Weather forced the Anzac Service to be held in the clubrooms and it was again conducted by the Ministers Fraternal.  Fortunately conditions afterwards improved and allowed the march to take place.  Remembrance Day proved very popular and greater interest was shown by the public.  The RSL Ball in the Town Hall was very enjoyable and owed much to the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  Between 60 & 70 diggers attended the annual dinner.  A Christmas party was held for members’ children.  We are still maintaining two Legacy Wards at £25 each.

Obituary.  Mrs George Parker was born at Stony Gap in 1869, the eldest daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Joseph Flower.  She was educated at Stony Gap and in 1893 married Mr George Parker.  After three years of marriage they moved to Copperhouse where they spent 23 years share-farming, shearing and contracting.

In 1916 Mr Parker bought a property at Booborowie and the family moved there until his death in 1946.  Mrs Parker then came to live in Queen Street in Burra where she lived alone until in the last five or six years of failing health she was forced to share her home life with daughter, Mrs H. Cornelius of Burra and Mrs Herb Collins of Booborowie.  She died at Burra Hospital on 8 January after an illness of nine weeks.  She leaves four daughters and one son: Vida Mrs Jack Pens (Burra), Mill Mrs Herbert Cornelius (Booborowie) [sic], Cecil (Queensland), Cass Mrs Oliver Earle (Swan Hill) and Lill Mrs H.

Burra Hospital Cropping Scheme.  The result of 194 bags was below target, but useful and a satisfactory result considering the unfavourable season.  Land is required now for the 1962 season.

Morgan-Whyalla Pipeline.  The SA Government is considering laying a 12 mile portion of the pipeline on the bed of Spencer Gulf.  If feasible this would cut the length by 56 miles of the 223 miles.  The suggestion would be to run from Pt Germein to Point Lowly at a maximum depth of 75 ft.  Three-quarters of this length is exposed at low tide.  The new pipe will be of 42 inches diameter for more than half its length and is expected to have a capacity of five times that of the original pipeline opened in 1944 at a cost of £2,750,000.  A work camp has been established at Spalding for the Hanson to Bundaleer section, on which work will start this month.  Duplication will take several years.

The Heliothis Grub poses a threat to lucerne seed crops in the next few weeks.  The moth has become more prevalent lately after a long period of little change.  Recommended control is 2 ounces of actual DDT (8 oz of 25 p.m. DDT) to the acre.  One spray gives one week’s protection at this time of the year.

Weather.  Hail storms.  A wild storm struck Mt Bryan about 4 p.m. on Friday in a confined strip.  Golf ball sized hail and 136 points of rain fell in 40 minutes accompanied by high winds which wrecked two sections of the wheat stack shed and hurled them through telephone lines and wrapped them around one of the large steel poles which was then levelled with ground, but which saved the hotel from being damaged by the flying debris.  Some of the 8 inch by 8 inch uprights were snapped off like carrots and twisted iron and broken timber littered the highway.  Telephone services to the north were cut.  A large tree near the station fell and cut railway control lines.  Hail broke windows and skylights and tore gardens to shreds.  Colin Lloyd, who was working at Mt Bryan, brought in some of the hail which would barely fit into the neck of a two pint thermos flask.  The creek north of the town came down and stranded a number of travellers.  At the top end of the creek Mr H. Griffen’s property received 3 inches with damage to fences etc.  Burra had a less severe hail storm at about 3 a.m. on Saturday.

Obituary.  Richard (Dick) Crang died in an Adelaide Hospital 24 January.  He spent five years in Burra at Elder, Smith & Co.  He joined Elders in 1932 at Wentworth NSW where he was born 49 years ago.  He came to Burra in 1935 and enlisted from here in June 1940 in the 2/7 Field Regiment AIF.  After the war he opened Elder’s Kingscote Branch and from 1947 to 1951 was manager at Pt Augusta.  He then spent five years as a Branch Inspector before opening Elder’s Alice Springs Branch in 1956.  Ill health forced a transfer to Adelaide twelve months ago.  He is survived by a widow and two sons, Bill and Richard.

Council Amalgamation was discussed at a meeting between the Burra Town and District Councils on 31 January following a petition from 300 ratepayers.  It was resolved that the Councils separately discuss the issues and there be another joint meeting 21 February.  Mr Baulderstone said the issue arose from a petition of ratepayers, but he personally felt from 15 successive years’ experience that the Town Council was too small.  The Council had reached its limit in rate revenue and the population had declined.  Rate revenue is three times that of thirty years ago, but administration [costs] are five time that of thirty years ago.  Money on administration could be saved by amalgamation.  He could not see why the two Councils could not work together.  The District Council than asked a series of questions:

What is the rate revenue?

What percentage of the ratepayers is represented by the 300 petitioners?

How many miles of road are there in the Town Council area?

How is the income spent?

Does the Council work on Ward Accounts?

Is money raised in a ward spent in the ward?

What is the percentage of administrative costs against rate revenue?

Town Council members felt they needed to discuss matters further in their own chamber.

DC Chairman A.D. Radford felt amalgamation would be a step in the right direction, though the opinion of Councillors in both Councils was divided. If amalgamation was desired there would be many problems to overcome and a series of meetings would be needed.

Burra Town Council met on 12 February to discuss the amalgamation with the District Council.  Most Councillors felt that the loss of town status and of the leadership of a Mayor and Mayoress would be an important deciding factor.  The expression of the ratepayers who signed the petition, giving reasons for the amalgamation would be sought.  It was felt much more discussion between the two Councils would be needed before the actual facts for and against any amalgamation could be laid before the ratepayers.  The Mayor protested against the long delay in repairing the footpath in front of his home; it having been ripped up by a Government Department and now has been sealed at his own expense.  He also objected to pine trees cut down and dumped along Mr Brian Riggs’ fence that should have been removed months ago.  The Town Council resolved to meet fortnightly instead of monthly, on the first and third Mondays of the month.

The Aberdeen Tennis Club is to be allowed to run a tournament on Easter Sunday subject to the Clerk establishing the legality of the agreement.

Burra Burra Show Inc.  Mr Rex. Warnes was re-elected President at the Annual Meeting.

Tribute was paid to Mr R. Fuss, Life Member of the Society, for his efforts in making additions and repairs and maintenance.

Mr Warnes reported a successful show on 7 October 1961 in perfect weather.  Gate takings were £241 and there was £41-15-0 from a ball run by the Rural Youth Club.  Entries numbered 2681, a record.  The tractor driving contest, held for the first time at a country show, proved successful.  Membership is steady, but the financial position is not quite as good as previously.

‘Once again Mr Robert Fuss has been a tower of strength to us with his work.  He saves us a considerable amount of money and is forever willing to keep things in order.  Through his efforts I can report the additions of a Casualty Room and a President’s Room.  Both proved an acquisition at the Show.  Mr Fuss was also instrumental in bringing the staging positions in the main pavilion up to date.  This caused a much better display of exhibits.  He also did numerous other jobs to benefit the Society, including the watering of trees which were presented by Mrs Stanley Hawker in front of the main buildings.  We are proud to have Mr Fuss as a Life Member.’

I regret to record the death of Mr Edwin Finch and Mr John Kellock who both did much solid work for the society.

Elected: Patron, G.S. Hawker; President, Rex C. Warnes; Vice-Presidents, Messrs B.A. Riggs & C.F. Pearce.

School opened on 19 January with 26 on the roll, but only 19 presented.  Later in the year the possibility of school closure was raised.  Mr James Reed presented a Model Ship to the school, the sale of which had raised a large sum for patriotic funds.  @3 March Sir Ross Smith and party arrived and a half-holiday was declared.  On 3 July the school closed for a fortnight in honour of the visit to SA of the Prince of Wales.

Aberdeen Football Club was re-formed last year after being in recess for a number of years.  An application to join the North Eastern League was rejected, but the club was accepted into the Mid North Association.  The club compared favourably with other teams in that Association.  Aberdeen’s Captain-Coach, Kevin Lane, was elected Captain of the Association team.  The team got as far as the preliminary final, which was very satisfactory for a first year team.  The club now has a very substantial club house erected and a hot shower room is nearing completion and should be ready for the first home match on 5 May.  The Captain topped the Association goal-kicking list and won the Mail Medal.  This year Kevin Lane is again Captain-Coach with Don Lloyd as Vice-Captain.  Darrel Kakoschke is Captain of the Colts.  A scratch match against Farrell Flat was played last Sunday at Farrell Flat.

Booborowie Tennis Club.  Fund raising for improvements has produced over £350 and concluded with a ball to wind up a Queen Competition.  Miss Kathleen Benton whose sponsors raised £172 was crowned Queen by Miss Port Adelaide (Miss Rosemary Searle).  [Two photos are printed.]

The long wooden bench that stood for many years under Sara’s verandah at Burra North has vanished.  If it was a prank, local elderly folk, who appreciated the chance for a ‘breather’ on it, are not amused.

Burra Town Council has resolved that on or before 31 December 1963 all buildings in the town area must be equipped with a septic tank.

A Ratepayers’ Meeting has been called for 1 May to consider the alteration to clause K in the lease agreement with the Aberdeen Tennis Club, the granting of a lease to the Burra & District Swimming Club and to receive the Mayor’s Report on the Council for 1961-62.

1921

Twenty-five students started the year.  On 6 April the school closed for the laying of the foundation stone of the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial by Governor Sir Archibald Weigall.  On 29 May heavy rain flooded the streets and Lady Hackett visited to speak to the girls about Girl Guides.  Inspector W. Adey cited average attendances and said Burra would be considered when the new Higher Primary Schools were being established.  Burra average attendance:

1913	25.3	1914	23	1915	24.2

1916	27.3	1917	23.8	1918	33.8

1923

Lancelot Carthew was Assistant in Charge with Miss O.G. Mawley & R. Davis.  Enrolment was 36.  On 24 March Miss Mawley transferred to Adelaide when attendance fell to 29.  On very hot days the boys were taken to the Mine Pool during the last lesson and the girls were dismissed.  Heavy rain made the road to Clare impassable for sports on 19 July and it wasn’t much better on 22 September when teams arrived at Clare at 10.30 and had to leave early on their return.

1924

Enrolment was 35.  Domestic Arts was introduced with Miss Forss (part-time).

Staff changes since Christmas:

Mrs Sladden, Miss Coventry and Mrs Sullivan have left, and Miss Reed, Miss Longford and Mr King have come.

There are seven teachers for seven classes.

Report for the past year:

Education Week passed off very well.  A sports day on the oval again replaced the annual picnic.  Visiting Day was held in conjunction with the High School and Arbor Day was held in winter.  The land between the Drill Hall and the School has at last been transferred to the Education Department and can now be developed as a playing area.  A sick bay has been built in the central part of the school and furnished by the Welfare Club.  All rooms now have efficient lighting for dull days.  Nothing has yet eventuated from a deputation and discussions regarding a crossing near the Town Hall.  At present two white lines make a crossing.  The school’s new roof was a godsend during this summer’s storms.  We are pushing for a Primary School toilet block on the east side of the school.  In the year sporting equipment has been purchased and a Christmas party was held in each class.  A school uniform has been selected with colours of grey and blue.

1925

Miss Olive Drever joined the staff as 0.2 time Domestic Arts Teacher.  Enrolment was a record 42 with 21 new students and 6 probationary.  The school was conducted in three rooms on the western side of the Primary School Building. 17 March was speech afternoon.  The Director of Education and the Superintendent of High Schools visited and decided the Physics room should be remodelled and the yard gravelled.  On 27 June a bus and six cars took students to Kapunda for sports.

1926

There was a complete change of staff with the arrival of Mr E.A. Haese as Headmaster with Miss Dorothy Robinson and Elsie Tiver (Part Time Domestic Arts).  Enrolment was 40.  School caps came from James Marshall & Co. at 2/11 each.  On 28 September the Old Scholars held a reunion in the Parish Hall.

The Anzac Service at Burra on Sunday saw a smaller attendance this year.  Before the service the Pt Pirie Piper’s Band played at the Burra Hospital between 12 and 1 p.m. At the service at the Memorial 86 ex-service personnel were on parade led by Burra RSL President H. Cornelius.  Rev. R.S. Jenner gave the address, which is printed in just less than 2 columns.  The march went from the RSL Building up Commercial Street to Kangaroo Street and returned to the Memorial.  W. Kotz & M. Burt were pallbearers.  Wreaths were placed by H. Cornelius (for the RSL), T.R. Rogers (for the Air Force Assoc.), Mr Arnold Heinrich (for Demobilised Soldiers), W. Carpenter (for the Fathers’ Assoc.), Mayor E.T. Baulderstone (for the Town Council) and Chairman A.D. Radford (for the District Council).  Flag attendants were H.L. Riggs and J. Lockett.  There was an evening service at St Mary’s conducted by Rev. T. Drought and a collection for Legacy.  He also conducted an Anzac Service at Booborowie Hall on Sunday at 3 p.m. with a lesson read by local RSL President Barry Dinham.

1927

The staff was unchanged from 1926.  Enrolments were 37.  On 4 February Premier Hon. L. Hill and the Minister of Education visited.  The building was severely commented upon and renovations and alterations worth £800 were promised.  [The building was condemned as being too dark and poorly ventilated.  The £800 was to enlarge windows and install new floors.]  The May vacation was extended one week at the request of the Duke of York.  On 21 September the Governor General Lord Stonehaven and Lady Stonehaven visited the school.

1928

Ruth Batchelor joined the staff and Elsie Tiver was transferred.  Mabel Nield replaced her as part-time Domestic Arts Teacher.  When enrolments increased to 60 an additional teacher, Miss Batchelor was appointed.  High School Council funds provided many teaching aids.  On 9 July the Aurora Australis was visible from 7 to 8.30 p.m.  For four months the school routine was upset by the alterations to improve lighting and ventilation.  Dr Steele was a driving force behind many of the changes.

Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting

Mr Baulderstone welcomed an unusually large attendance of 55.  After he had introduced the items of business, he accepted the motion of Mr H.C. Cummins that competitive tennis be permissible (upon written application to the Corporation) between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sundays.  Mr H. Jennison spoke against it – being opposed in principle.  Mr F. Reed spoke in support – mainly citing the financial benefits to the club and through that to the town.  Mr Cummins also spoke in support and it was passed 28 to 18.

The Burra Amateur Swimming Club had been running the pool without a lease and the Mayor felt a lease desirable and so Council had one drawn up to run from 1962 to 1972.  Mr H. Cornelius moved the lease be granted.  This was seconded by T.G. Perry and carried.

A lease for the Burra North Playground was also carried.

Mr Baulderstone appealed for questions to be asked about the amalgamation of the Councils, rather than as street gossip.  He also challenged the view heard in the street that the town was going backwards.  He did not agree.  In the last few years there had been significant improvements at the racecourse, the showgrounds, playground, basketball courts, oval, small bore range, the Post office, the swimming pool and the hospital.  Some progress in the past year had been stifled through lack of money.  Council had sought £1,200 for the school road, but had got only £700.  Numerous bridges needed repair or renewal and again the Kangaroo Street Bridge needed £500, but the grant was for £300, leaving the Council to meet the gap, as it had to for the school road.  The cemetery is old and hard to maintain and permission is being sought to remove headstones.  Tree planting had been encouraged and it is unfortunate that some of the CWA Avenue on the approach to the town had to be removed by the Highways Department to re-form the road.  Burra was a beautiful town, but lends itself to further beautification, especially along the creek and around the pool area.  He had plans in mind to achieve this together with a Caravan Park area.  Street lighting is now quite satisfactory.  The attendance at pictures had declined, but it was still a paying proposition.  The £6,000 borrowed to renovate the Town Hall was covered by a special rate of 4d, but interest and repayments come from the pictures and the rate is merely security.  A bequest from the late Mrs Gare enabled the Town Hall stage to be modified and renovated.  The erratic dumping of rubbish at the mine is causing trouble and needs the Council’s attention in the coming year.

Burra Ratepayers’ Meeting: Report continued from last week.

The Mayor said he felt bitter that after the 1961 ratepayers’ meeting rumours circulated that about £1,000 repaid to the Council by the Police Department had not been accounted for and ratepayers had been misled.  This money (£961-5-4) was received on 29 June 1960 and the amount of £493-13-7 due to the Pictures account and £467-12-1 to the general account and this appeared in the 1960-61 balance.  Neither he nor his Council had anything to hide and as Chairman of the Finance Committee for ten years he could answer any question put forward.

[Check this statement because if, as it seems to imply, the sum received was divided between the two accounts, it doesn’t quite add up.]

On Council amalgamation he reported two meetings with the District Council, but after discussion neither he nor his Council could see any major gains in rates or administration and therefore had decided against it.  He thanked Councillors and others including Mrs Baulderstone.

Mr S.J. Woollacott expressed dissatisfaction on the views about the amalgamation, stating he had spent many hours gathering the petition.

Cr Cornelius said he had originally been in favour, but after consultation could see no gains and changed his mind.  Mr Baulderstone said it had been ‘harped’ on for some years and although he had been in favour, he would not support it at this time.

Mr Woollacott also felt that more should be spent on premises owned by him considering the rates he paid.

[Check.  Presumably he meant of services like roads and footpaths adjacent to his properties.]

Mr Jennison commented on the unsightly sandbags used for the traffic island in Market Square.

The Mayor said it was hoped the Highways Department would do something towards implementing a plan that had been approved.

A.J. Bruce commented on the unfit state of the ladies’ conveniences near the Fire Station.  The Mayor agreed, but blamed the travelling public.  Mrs S. Scroop supported this view.

Mr J.G. Carpenter wanted the eradication of noxious weeds enforced.

Mr R. Jennison thought the Aberdeen Playground was in a sad state and Mr W.H. Lloyd (Committeeman) said the swings were in a sorry state, but some new equipment had been added.  There were also questions on cemetery upkeep.

Mr D.T. Jacka, in commenting on town progress, said 24 new homes had been built in Burra since the war.

Mr R.M. Reed asked about the whereabouts of funds donated for school crossing lights that had not eventuated.  The Mayor blamed the previous Town Clerk for inaction here [and for lack of action on cleaning water-tables.]

Dr Pitcher supported the Mayor, saying they had been led to believe there were complications involved, but recent discussions with the Highways Department suggested there would not be difficulties and the matter was being taken up again.  Mr Woollacott queried the competence of the Council in blaming the former Town Clerk for inadequacies and Mr Baulderstone said he would not stand again and so give the town a chance to install a capable Council.

Mr Jennison proposed a vote of thanks to the Mayor and hoped Mr Baulderstone would reconsider his decision regarding a further term as Mayor.

Jennison’s Tyre Service is 40 years old today.  Mr H.J.B. Jennison opened the business on 22 May 1922 as a tyre retailer and repairer.  Years ago tyres had to be ordered from overseas with waiting periods of six months.  Now the stock held can supply most needs for cars, tractors and farm machinery.  The business has expanded to include repairs and a Lubritorium.  A big change has been to get the public to buy Australian tyres and another was the change from solid to pneumatic tyres on tractors.  Methods of retreading tyres had also changed in that period.

R.E. Dewhirst writes regarding Colts Football.

With NEFL changing to a ‘B’ Grade competition a group at Booborowie has decided to re-form Booborowie Colts.  Spalding and Hallett seem able to form a Colts team, but Burra (because Aberdeen already has a Colts team in the Mid North League) may not be able to do so – though it may yet prove possible.

Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1929

E.A. Haese was Headmaster with Ruth Bachelor, Elizabeth Jones and Stella Parker.  The enrolment was 54.  The school was still being painted when the year began.  A professor deplored the waste of money in educating many in our schools and Dr Steele attacked him, saying that knowledge was power and while it might be dangerous to educate the masses, it was right to give the boys and girls every chance and this was a duty parents owed the child and the nation.

1930

The staff was unchanged and the enrolment was 49.  The Headmaster returned to find drawers forced, lockers broken and 11/7 missing.  On 3 September Brown’s bus, Fuss’s lorry and seven cars took students to Clare for the Mid North High Schools’ Sports.  Between Hanson and Farrell Flat Fuss’s lorry was bogged for two hours.

Burra High School.  A Jubilee Committee has been formed at the school to arrange the celebrations.  The Jubilee Project is the improvement of the playing area.  An expenditure of £1,200 is anticipated.  The project includes laying two tennis courts with cyclone wire enclosure (to be used for basketball in winter), and also two half cricket pitches and a sprinkler system to water a grassed area for football, softball and athletics.

The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1931

The staff was E.A. Haese Headmaster, Beryl Dunstan, Olive Prior, Mabel Dunstan & H. Robinson.  On 7 March in a cricket match against Clare Alan Phillips, a left handed bowler took four wickets from four successive balls.  The Government was considering closing country high schools and on 21 July a deputation from Burra High School Council waited on the Minister of Education at Parliament House.

1932

There were no staff changes.  Enrolment was 57.  On 13 February a working bee was organised for improving the Mine Pool.  A path was cut to the edge of the pool and dressing sheds and a safety fence were later erected.  A cricket pitch was prepared for the girls.  On 26 April Lyall Turner broke his arm when he fell from his horse while riding to school.

(To be continued.)

Willalo Hall.  A recent meeting of the committee decided to install a lighting plant and to renovate and paint the exterior.  A social afternoon, which was held on 25 May to raise funds, resulted in £52.

Weather.  This week there were further general falls in which Burra recorded 118 points.

There was a heavy downpour on Saturday at 11 p.m. just as patrons left the pictures and rain reduced attendance at the RSL Ball on Friday night too.

Annual Catholic Ball at the Burra Town Hall on Friday drew a fair crowd.  The sumptuous supper followed a somewhat unenjoyable period on the dance floor.  The general view was that the band lost all sense of time and beat and was merely loud and blaring.  While the band had supper Miss Shirley Ryan on the piano and a drummer provided a more satisfactory accompaniment for several dances.  Door takings were about £63.

At the International Day Mr A.L. Clode presented on behalf of himself and family a very lovely polished table in memory of his late wife, who had been an active and good CWA worker.  Also the rooms received their new toilet floor covering and a large green and yellow blind for the western window.  Mrs Ralph Murray was the guest speaker.  CWA also catered for the race meeting on 21 March.  The branch catered for several weddings as well in the year.

Revs T.G. Drought & Richard S. Jenner write calling on the Town Council to call a public meeting for the purpose of holding a Home and Family Week in Burra, as had been done elsewhere in SA.  The idea would be to promote Education in Marriage, Parenthood and Family Relationships.

It would require

The availability of the Town Hall or other suitable premises.

The co-operation of the churches.

The recognition that much voluntary work would be involved.

The Governor & Lady Bastyan will visit Burra on 9 November.

A Burra-Adelaide Road Race is expected to be run by the Goodwood Cycling Club in August.

Burra Town Council has protested against the increase in its contribution to the Burra Hospital.  It is not happy with having to charge ratepayers more to cover this increase.

The Education Department advised that construction of a new 32 ft x 24 ft Science Laboratory costing an estimated £5,500 will be commenced next month.  Also that improvements to the playing area costing £1,200 should move smartly along.  The school yard was resurfaced with bitumen last week.

Burra Bowling Club.  President S.J. Woollacott’s report.

The year has been a social and financial success.  There were 71 members last year and 69 this year.  The Blue Team won the pennant in the North Eastern Association, but in the Mid North Association both teams finished near the bottom.  The Easter Tournament was a great success.

[He continues after discussing the club games and tournaments.]

Three things now need our attention:

The present toilet facilities are an embarrassment and a completely new block is required.

The clubroom requires lining.

Some feel that external lighting is required.

The toilets would cost £400 to £500 and one Night Tournament would cover the £20 interest charge.

The death during the year of their oldest member Mr E. Finch was greatly regretted.  He had been a foundation member and a past patron.

[The report concludes with thanks to committee members and a number of individuals.]

Burra High School.  The Jubilee History continued by R.V. Mueller.

1949

The staff was as for 1948 except that Rae T. Blesing replaced Alma Hill.  The enrolment was 66.

The Minister for Education Mr R. Rudall and the Director of Education Mr E. Mander-Jones visited the school and discussed the schoolyard, the building of new laboratories, painting of the school and the erection of new classrooms, but the Minister did not promise much.  On 29 April the students visited Adelaide by train (three of them for the first time).  Two new classrooms were opened by Mr [illegible] Walker, Inspector of Technical Schools.

1950

The staff were H.O. Pederick Headmaster, Ivor Burdon, John G. Deer, Rae F. Blesing, Ronald E. Walker and Nancy Hannaford.  Enrolments were 62.  Painters moved in to repaint the school in May.  New septic tank lavatories were installed.  A polio epidemic discouraged any indoor functions.  The Parents & Friends Assoc. presented an Encyclopaedia Britannica worth £93.

1951

The staff was the same as for 1950 except that Margaret Miller replaced Nancy Hannaford.  Enrolment was 65.  Two houses were bought for staff members by the Education Department.  Buses were complained about – one was very cold in winter and hot and dusty in summer.  The other was so small it had to make two journeys morning and night.

1952

Staff were H.O. Pederick Headmaster, Ivor Burdon, John Deer, Clare Milazzo, Ronald Walker and Helen Inglis.  Enrolment was 66.  The underground tank became polluted with dead rats and pigeon manure.  ‘It is believed that when the tanks were emptied recently six dead rats were removed and approximately 61 buckets of pigeon manure.’

Trees were planted in honour of old scholars who had made the supreme sacrifice.  Mr S. Woollacott presented the honour roll.

Burra High School.  Jubilee Celebrations

On Thursday there was an inspection of present classes at work, a ‘back to school’ class and the opening of the new sports area, followed by a concert at night in the Town Hall.

The Headmaster Mr R. Mueller greeted visitors and organised them into seven groups to visit the school.  [Guides as per list last week.]  The back-yo-school class assembled at the rear of the school and marched with the aid of drummer Norrie Baynes to the tennis courts where the teacher was Mr L. Carthew.  [The ‘pupils are listed.]

Five of those attending were from the 1913 class.  Others attending were Mr Joe Statton (the first headmaster), Mr Biddle, Mr Haese and Mr Murray Scriven; all former headmasters.  Mr L.W. Gare, one of the 1913 class, moved a vote of thanks.  From here there was a move to the new sports area and despite a bleak day with gusty winds and a shower or two, the crowd persisted.  [Official guests are listed.]  The Mayor Mr Baulderstone welcomed visitors and Mr Mueller also welcomed them to the school.  He particularly welcomed Mr Statton (Superintendent of High Schools).  Mr Jennison, in his speech as Chairman of the High School Council, said 100 old scholars had enlisted in WWII and eleven had died in that conflict.  The Parents & Friends, Association had raised £1,434-10-0 in the last five years, and today’s project, though not yet completed, would cost £1,200, split equally between the Parents & Friends’ Association and the Department.  It was only a week or two ago that the signal to proceed had come through and much was due to the efforts of Messrs Hirschausen Bros and D.A. Halliday that so much of it had already been accomplished.  Mr A.K. Statton then opened the new sports area.

Football

Keith Warrior of Hallett won the Burra Record Trophy for football in 1962.  Keith was the runner-up in the 1962 Mail Medal for the North Eastern League.

Burra High school Jubilee Celebrations

During the party Mr Jennison hoped Mrs Draysey would enjoy her brief return to Burra and a variety of other people spoke.  Former Headmaster Mr Biddle said that 46 years ago there had been one teacher and one room, making it difficult to keep all classes going smoothly.  Transport difficulties made it hard to increase roll numbers, though a few like Cliff Flower and Fred Schultz came in on horseback.  Others who spoke included Barbara Hogan (Head Prefect), Hedley Pearce, Murray Scriven and Mr A. Bartholomaeus, who was number 1on the High School roll.  Mrs M. Kellock moved a vote of thanks on behalf of the Parents & Friends Association.  The Burra Town Hall was filled to capacity on Thursday night for the concert [for which items are listed.]

On Friday morning there was a basketball match in which Old Scholars 18 defeated Present Scholars 17.  [Best players are cited.]  In the afternoon the football game resulted in a victory for Old Scholars 11.14 to Present Scholars 7.6. [Teams are listed.]

On Friday night the Town Hall was again filled to capacity for the annual ball.  Door takings exceeded £160.

Burra & District Amateur Swimming Club held its AGM.

Mr E. Orchard said the club was formed in lieu of the Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee at the start of the 1960-61 season and affiliated with the SA Amateur Swimming Association for the 1961-62 season.  The last season was the club’s first serious season of competitive swimming and it was very satisfying to run out winners of the Eric Tilbrook shield in the triangular competition with Clare and Spalding.  This led to the formation recently of the Mid North Amateur Swimming Association of which Burra, Clare and Spalding are the foundation members.  In the past year a lease was obtained from the Burra Town Council and includes 60 ft beyond the present northern boundary to allow room for a barbecue and other entertainment facilities.  Over £200 was spent for cabinets for the PA system, stop watches and a filing cabinet.  In addition to inter-club competition, the two main functions are the Learn to Swim Campaign in the school holidays and the annual open carnival.  Recently the ladies have formed an auxiliary and so far they have added over £40 to funds.  Funds are needed to install a filtration and chlorination plant at an estimated cost of about £4,500 – fortunately subsidised pound for pound by the SA Government Tourist Bureau.

Fortunately we have a plentiful supply of cheap clear water, which needs to be changed more frequently in the hot weather, but this will push up costs as we exceed our water allowance and the filtration plant is needed, especially if Burra’s water supply should change to Murray water.  Thanks are due to Mr Bill Broad as caretaker, following the resignation of Dave Tanswell.  Mr Allan Ireland has had to resign as Secretary on being transferred to Jamestown.

Burra Burra DC will use a grant of £650 to spray horehound on the stock route between Burra and Robertstown soon.  Boxthorn will be attacked as well and it is hoped to get as far as Redbanks with the bulldozer this year.

Burra Mine.  In answer to a question from Mr Quirke MP, Sir Thomas Playford said that because mineral rights had been alienated from the Crown in the area it was impossible to get organisations with sufficient capital to take on exploration due to uncertainty of tenure.  Amendments currently before the House of Assembly should facilitate investigations at Burra and similar places in some of the older mining areas of SA.

Burra Town Council

Council is to inspect the section of Thames St required by H. Quissner [sic: Queissner?]

In reply to Mr R.M. Reed the Clerk will write to Mr Reed saying they consider Mr Jeffery has acted in good faith on the word of the previous Town Clerk and they consider that Mr Reed has access to the back of his property by way of Jessie Street and they would require further explanation from him of why Anne Street needs to be open.

The estate of E.T. Rooke was given permission to demolish an old house.

The Clerk will write to the Highways and Local Government Department giving the Council’s views that, with the advent of Grain Silos at Burra, it would be better for the [Bon Accord] bridge to be reconstructed, rather than open Young Street as the main road.

The Clerk will write to the Attorney General about the old portion of the cemetery, asking how old graves must be and what procedure must be followed when reclaiming.

M.E. & E.M. Mitchell will be permitted to open a new pit in the Council’s Mine area and pay 1/- per yard royalty on all rubble excavated.

Characteristics of the paper in 1962.

Generally there was a fair coverage of Burra and District.  The areas beyond Farrell Flat and Booborowie have generally not been noted.  Type-setting seems to have been rather better, with fewer inaccuracies.

Photographs became much more common, bur blocks were not prepared locally and so they are often a week or even more later than the story.

Weather.  December 1962 was the wettest on record with district falls ranging from 2 inches to 6 inches.  Burra had rain from the Sunday before Christmas to the following Sunday.  Christmas day was wet and cold and many people sat around fires.  Burra rain: 24th 18 points, 25th 0, 26th 124, 27th 30, 28th 64, 29th 151, 30th 0, 31st 58 points for a total of 445 points for the week and 456 for the month.  The previous wettest December was 426 points in 1929. The yearly total was 20.11 inches for 1962; about 2 inches above average.

This rain damaged wheat crops, where some grain gas shot in the heat.  Some bagged wheat has also shot and will need to be re-bagged.  Considerable reaping is yet to be done and damage there is yet to be assessed.  From Burra to Saddleworth farmers report bleaching of wheat, with one bag in nine lost on account of weight.  In the pastoral country the rain was welcomed.  Some areas had not had significant rain for three or four years.  Falls to the 31 December: Oakbank 525 points, Pine Valley 411, Kia Ora 340, Poonunda 584, Oakvale 561, Woolgangi 480 and Koomooloo 402.  Practically all dams are full.  [Photo of the St Just Street Ford in flood.]

Learn to Swim Campaign this year saw 120 children take part.

Vandals on New Year’s Eve uprooted sign posts and shifted warning signs from a shaft at the Mine entrance.

Christmas in Burra

Christmas Eve was busy and trading was equal to previous years, though the numbers around were less, no doubt due to the cold conditions.  Father Christmas arrived on schedule.  The merry-go-round did not operate in the afternoon due to rain.  The Rural Youth Dance did well and raised £26 for Rally Funds this year.

B.J. (Bill) Lee of Burra celebrated his 80th birthday on 13 January.

Floods.  The creek through West Ward overflowed twice during the December rains.  On 28 December following 133 points in 20 minutes and secondly on 30 December when 58 points fell in 30 minutes.  Debris from the first flood and trees growing in the creek made the second flooding worse.  Water ran down Commercial Street 6 inches deep and then flowed down the full width of Thames Street.  Some damage was done to businesses in Commercial Street.

Obituary.  Harold Vivian Lord was the eldest son of the late Mr & Mrs J.V. Lord and was born at Burra in 1888.  He spent his early life at the Barrier in the early days of prospecting and mining at Thackaringa, Silverton, Daydream, Broken Hill and Pinnacles.  He lived on Silverdale, a pastoral property owned by his father, which was later incorporated into ‘Thackaringa’ Station, a family holding still occupied by his nephews.  He was educated at Prince Alfred College and the SA School of Mines in wool-classing.  After a short while at his father’s southern home at Sandergrove, he took over management of Pine Valley Station east of Burra and actively ran this property for forty years and at his death was the owner within the interests of J.V. Lord & Sons.  He introduced deep boring to the east country, sinking Cockatoo Bore to 680 ft.  As partner in J.V. Lord & Sons he had an interest too in Kalkaroo, Oakvale, Lord’s Well and Balah and was consultant for his sister’s property Eureka NSW and a director of the family’s pastoral companies at Yardea in the northwest and Tresant in the South East of SA.

Burra High School Speech Night and 50th Annual Report.

In the last year the school celebrated it Golden Jubilee, had a Vice-Regal Visit and was host for the combined High Schools Sports Day.

The year opened with an enrolment of 146: made up of 77 boys and 69 girls and we expect it to be 160 in 1963.  If staff permits we will make a second 1st Year Class.  The only staffing changes in 1962 were the resignation of Junior Teacher Kym Horsnell and the arrival of J. Murphy from England.  Now we say farewell to Mr Sladden and Mr Hillman; the former to Gawler and the latter to Henley High.

Religious Instruction continues to run smoothly.

Last year I reported the Education Department agreed to rent the area southwest of the school and to make available a subsidy and to grant £135 for initial ground formation.  This has allowed the completion of two tennis courts (also two basketball courts) and two half cricket pitches in the last year and the grassing of the area for athletics, football and softball, together with a water reticulation system.  Backstops are now planned for the courts at the front of the school.

The Parents & Friends’ Association has continued its good work and catered very well at the school’s sports day and also the combined schools’ sports, when they catered for 300 adults and 700 students.  £100 was raised. At the Jubilee Ball the gross takings were £160.  The Jubilee Birthday Party was also organised.  The Jubilee ‘Statton’ playing area will be a memorial to their effort to mark the school’s 50th birthday.

Improvements this year have concentrated on improving the playing facilities.  56 girls can now be absorbed in basketball at a time, compared with 14 previously.  Cricket and tennis facilities have also increased.  On Arbor Day trees were planted. This year the asphalt paving area was resurfaced, a gas stove installed and two new £4,000 buses for the Hallett & Hanson runs arrived.  A new £5,000 laboratory is to be commenced in January 1963.

The Jubilee Celebrations in brief:

Thursday 30 August.	Inspection of the school at work.

A ‘Back-to-School Class’ was conducted by Mr. L. Carthew.

Mr A.K. Statton Superintendent of High Schools opened the Sports Area.

RSL Annual Report 1962

Attendance has been just enough to keep the branch open.  During the year two sets of indoor bowls were procured with money left by the estate of the late Mrs Sara Gare, which made for many happy evenings for the Ladies’ Auxiliary.  On Anzac Day the march and parade was led by the Port Pirie Pipers’ Band and the evening service was held in St Mary’s.  Eighteen members attended.  Remembrance Day was observed with the usual service at the Memorial in Market Square.  Held on a Sunday when a number of members were absent, it drew only sixteen of them.  The Ministers’ Fraternal did not reply to the invitation this time and the President read Mr Bean’s Requiem instead.  The annual ball was successful thanks to the Ladies’ auxiliary in particular.  Forty-six members attended the annual dinner, with visitors also from headquarters, Saddleworth, Jamestown, Farrell Flat and Hallett.  It was very successful from a social point of view.  The Christmas party was a small event, but most enjoyable.   The Burra RSL continues to support two Legacy wards – largely from money from bottles collected by people of the district.  The Governor, Sir Edric Bastyan paid a visit on 9 November and shook hands with each of the approximately 60 members present.

Equipment using induced polarisation has been used.  Electrical pulses are polarised by ore pockets and the degree of polarisation can indicate the metals present.  Drilling is also continuing, though problem with sand falls and the need to cement sections have delayed this work.

Obituary.  Rev. Albert Bell, Secretary of the Home Mission Department.

A photo in the Home Mission Office taken thirty years ago shows a Federal Inland Mission vehicle in front of Parliament House Canberra and Albert Bell is pointing to the legend on the bonnet of the Didge Truck – ‘Derby to Sydney via the Granites’.  One is not surprised that Rev. Albert Bell should have been the first to cross Australia between those two points in a motor vehicle.  He was born at Hetton Down, County Durham, UK, on 29 December 1896 and migrated to WA where he entered the service of the Methodist Church.  The WA Home Mission Department appointed him a missioner to Kojonup in the far South East agricultural and pastoral area of WA in 1928.  The mission had only been established in the north of WA for three years when Rev. Bell volunteered to go there in 1930 and was appointed to the Kimberley Patrol.  He had an area of nearly 100,000 square miles and was at Derby in ‘the wet’ and at Wyndham in ‘the dry’.  At Wyndham he established a debating society with an average attendance of 100 and basketball and athletic clubs flourished under his infectious enthusiasm.  In eight years Rev. Bell made the Methodist Mission there widely known and respected.  He then came south in 1938 and married Ivison Holliday of Victor Harbor on 19 February 1938 and they enjoyed a wonderful partnership for twenty-five years and one day.  There was a honeymoon voyage to England in the sailing ship Pommern via Cape Horn.  On returning to Australia he became pastor to the Port Adelaide Central Methodist Mission and assistant to the late Rev. A.D. McCutcheon for eleven years.  In 1948 he applied for ministerial status and was ordained with status retrospective to 1938.  From 1950 he served circuits at Angaston, Red Hill and Hallett-Terowie, where he was beginning his fifth year.  He was an artilleryman in the Imperial Forces in WWI and spent ten months as a POW.  He was a member of the RSL and Treasurer of the Hallett Sub-branch, a Vice-President of the Cricket Club and Chaplain to the local Lodge of Freemasons, a member of the Hallett Institute and of the Bowling Club.  He was a forthright preacher whose sermons were original and arresting.

[Born 29 December 1896 Hetton Down, Co. Durham, UK: died 20 February 1963, Hallett.]

Burra Burra Show Inc.  The President Presents the 88th Annual Report.

The Annual Show was held on 6 October in vile, cold and windy conditions with hail.  The gate takings fell to £145-17-0, aided by £16-4-6 from the dance conducted by the Rural Youth Club.  Entries were numerous (2,500).  Exhibits in the main hall benefited from the fine improvements carried out by Mr R. Fuss.  For the first time a buffet lunch was served for official guests, which proved successful.  Membership remains steady, but the financial position has deteriorated.

Burra Small Bore Club.  The best results over double 75 yards came from W. Corner, P. Mengersen and M. Alderson.

Burra Races

Despite a good track, good facilities and trophies that were magnificent, the races on Wednesday last were not well supported by owners and trainers and the public generally failed to attend.  The weather was ideal and the track and surroundings were in excellent condition.  The Club consequently suffered a considerable loss.

Fire destroyed c. 300 acres of feed and half a mile of fencing on Wednesday afternoon on Koonoona property near the old Sod Hut Hotel.  It seems to have been caused by a cigarette butt or match.

PMG advises that from 22 March there will be three additional phone circuits between Burra and Clare.

Koonoona Stud celebrates its centenary with its annual Field Day on Thursday. It was founded by Hon. Walter Duffield and Mr T.S. Porter with 50 selected ewes from ‘Hill River’ and rams from Mount Crawford.  It remained in the same ownership till 1875 when Mr Porter retired and was replaced by Col. F. Makin.  When Mr Duffield died in 1880 the trustees of the estate administered the property till 1918, when it was sold to the beneficiaries and the then manager, Mr W.G .Hawkes.  The name was changed then to Koonoona Proprietors.  Mr Hawkes retired in 1930 and his son, Mr Glen Hawkes, acquired an interest as Managing Director, which position he held till his death in 1961.  The present Managing Director is Mr R.K. Pearse, who first came to Koonoona in 1938 as a jackeroo and returned as manager in 1952.  The present overseer is Mr R. Osborne.  The first Field Day (then called an Inspection Day) was held in 1946.  Koonoona was the first SA stud to fly rams to the Sydney Sheep Show and the first SA stud to sell a ram in Sydney for 1,000 guineas.  Since 1910 it has been a closed stud, producing a particularly even type of sheep that have proved their worth in all states and New Zealand with a reputation for heavy wool cutting ability.  It comprises 22,600 acres and presently carries 16,000 sheep.

Burra Burra Show Inc.  Since the report last week Mr R. Fuss says the major credit for improvements in the Flower Pavilion must go to Mrs Sid Scroop for fixing valances to the tables, assisted by Mr Scroop.

Burra Primary School Committee

After 14 years on the committee and 11 as chairman, Mr Stockman felt he should hand on to someone else.  Elected: Chairman D.H. Field and Secretary-Treasurer, D.F. Bannister.

Retiring Chairman, M.G. Stockman, presented the 88th report.

The staff position changed with the transfer of Mr King.  Two replacement teachers, Mr Pope and Miss Ronan gave us the full staff for a Class III school and allowed the Head Teacher Mr Horsnell the freedom to do his administrative duties.  The highlight of the year was the Vice-Regal visit of Sir Edric and Lady Bastyan.  The sports day at the oval was very successful.  Visiting Day drew many parents and friends.  Arbor Day was held at the beginning of winter and a variety of trees were planted.  We have not been able to get a school crossing sign or flashing lights, as the Highways Department will not sanction these when the school is not adjacent to the road.  The most they will sanction is the NSC sign and red flags and these were duly erected by the Town Council.  We are keeping the matter in mind if the Road Traffic Act is changed.  Tenders should soon be called for a new block of lavatories for Primary School use, for the asphalting of the balance of the yard on the eastern side, the fencing of the new Drill Hall block, which has been added to the playing area and a retaining wall and backstop for the tennis courts.  [Thanks to various people are also expressed.]

Mr & Mrs Jim Prior of Hallett celebrated their Golden Wedding with a dinner for 150 people at the Hallett institute on Saturday 6 April.  In 1918 Jim married Miss Ruby Brown at Broken Hill at the first motorised wedding there.  [If this was their golden wedding they should have been married in 1913!]  The couple moved to SA when their daughter Elva was three weeks old.  In the 1920s Jim, known as ‘Nigger’ played football and cricket for Hallett and more recently he was runner-up in the singles bowls championship.  He has always been a strong supporter of the athletics clubs in the district.  Mr Pryor thanked the many friends he had in the district over 46 years there [suggesting he arrived in 1917.]  The cake for the occasion was made by daughter Elva, Mrs Backshall of Mt Barker WA.  Joyce, Mrs L.H. Aldridge and her husband were also present from WA.  [Details of this event extend for 2 columns with 2 photographs: one of the couple and one of Mr A.G. Owen-Smyth proposing a toast.]

Mr E.A. (Curly) Wohling & Mrs Wohling are leaving Burra today after Mr Wohling has spent 64 years in the town, while Mrs Wohling was born here 73 years ago.  They will live with their son Ken and his wife Pat at Maylands.  Mr Wohling was born at She-Oak Log 80 years ago and was educated at Lindley (between Morgan and Florieton) and came to Burra at the age of 16 when he began to work on Redcliffe Station.  This was then owned by Messrs Scott & Son and from there he went to Braefoot owned by Mr Henry Scott.  After a spell of several years in Victoria he returned to Braefoot where a Mr Hill had taken over.  His work comprised shearing, farming, blacksmithing and sheep work etc.  His sporting interests included football, cricket and cycling.  Fifty-three years ago he married Miss Laura Lihou and they have lived in Burra ever since.  Mr Wohling commenced work as a barman at the Burra Hotel when Mr Carl Heinrich was the proprietor and has seen many changes there over 38 years.  When Mr Tom and Miss E.A. Scovell took over the Commercial Hotel Mr Wohling went there for 13 years before retiring.  Mr Wohling recalled riding against the cyclists Jack Richards (the first man to sell cars in Burra), Syd Grivell, Charlie Waldie [sic: Wardle?], ‘Pop’ Gardner, Albert & Bill Lomman (still riding), Harry & Oliver Baynes, Bill Bartel, Jim Bradley, J.D. ‘Duncan’ Kelly, Tommy Hogart and Alf & Albert McWaters.  His best distance was the half mile and most races were at Victoria Park.  He recalls playing football when Aberdeen and Kooringa played in snow and Aberdeen 0.5 defeated Kooringa 0.3.  When working at Woolgangi and Bungunya he would ride his bike into Burra on Saturday morning to play football and return on Sunday.

Obituary.  Ben Dunstan of Mt Bryan East died at Burra Hospital 3 June aged 87.  He had been President of the Mt Bryan Agricultural Bureau for many years and was a life member.  He was also President of the Mt Bryan East Fire Fighting Association; a member of the Oddfellows and Masonic Lodges and of the Liberal and Country League, and was very interested in politics.  He was the first scholar (of 7) enrolled at the Mt Bryan East School when it opened in 1885 under the tuition of Mr Whittington.  His knowledge of the early days of the district’s settlement was second to none.  In his youth he was a keen cricketer.  He had charge of the Mt Bryan East Post Office till it closed a few years ago.  His wife died in 1957.  The only children were Mr Jack Dunstan of Mylor and Mr Hugh Dunstan of Whyte Yarcowie.  There is one granddaughter.  [Benjamin Hugh Knuckey Dunstan born 28 August 1875 Redruth: died 3 June 1963 Burra, residence Mt Bryan East.]

The Grand Elephant Race

Messrs Bence and Flaherty raced elephants from Ashton’s Circus down Commercial Street at 5.15 p.m. on Tuesday.  The aim was to raise funds for new toilets at the oval.  Sahib Bence drew Jahore and Sahib Flaherty drew Jumbo.  There was a preliminary canter from Jennison’s Garage to the Post Office, where the race proper began.  In the run back to the garage Jumbo looked like an easy winner at first, but Sahib Bence drew big Jahore to the outside and with more courage than control went on to win by four lengths.  Sahib Bence’s descent over Jahore’s head and down its trunk was most undignified, but can be excused on the grounds of youthful exuberance and the flush of victory.  The collection for the event amounted to £23-12-0.

Weather.  Rain for the week fell practically every day and for Burra totalled 205 points.  The Burra Creek ran strongly and deposited quite a load of rubbish at the Pig and Whistle Crossing.  The Young Street Ford was closed, but a car was caught in the water and came to rest against the concrete pillar of the old footbridge.  The occupants of the car climbed to the roof and awaited help.  Mr S. Irlam later towed it out of the creek.  Mr R. Sandercock’s garage took off in Saturday afternoon’s strong wind.  The wind lifted it neatly, leaving Mrs Sandercock’s car standing in the open without damage.

Other falls for the week included 226 points at Mt Bryan, 195 at Booborowie and 317 at Farrell Flat.

Floodwaters from the property of D.H. Adams and properties to the west caused a large volume of water to cross the bitumen road about 150 yards north of Mr Adam’s home on Saturday evening.  A large bank of sand and silt was deposited across the road.  Mr Adams and Mr Colin Pfitzner hauled a number of cars out with a tractor until Constable P. Logan closed the road.  At 9 a.m. Sunday the Council grader cleared the obstruction and the road, though still flooded, was re-opened.  Floodwaters also crossed the road from Coghill Creek near the town where two and a half feet of water stopped traffic for many hours.  Other district roads have been damaged.

Burra Town Council

Council intends to reclaim a portion of the cemetery.

For some time now the question of reclaiming a portion of the cemetery has been debated by Council.  Although the period of the leases of 99 years has expired on the majority of blocks in the central portion of the cemetery, certain legal questions needed to be checked and permission obtained from the attorney General.  This has now been completed and Council is now prepared to clear and reclaim this part of the cemetery.  This is required because at the average rate of burials the cemetery will be filled in two or three years.  Any person holding a block with an unexpired lease in this area is asked to contact the Town Clerk, Mr Holness – the block numbers to be cleared are listed elsewhere in this paper.  As well as making more blocks available, this move will also make the area clean and tidy.

[Page 2 had a list of block numbers involved: 542 to 699, 704 to 753 and 758 to 1,271.]

Burra Hospital.  86th Annual Report of the Chairman to 30 June 1963.

The hospital is in a sound financial position.

The overdraft has been reduced from £5,369 at 30 June 1960 to the present figure of £2,292.  There is £2,595 in our Maintenance Reserve and £3,019 in the Donations Account and £418 in the Building Fund.  The year’s operations had a surplus of £1,791.  The improvement has been due to a greater number of patients and an increase in the number of patients in a Hospital Benefits Fund, which has greatly reduced bad debts.  The Board has plans to build four new private rooms, a duty room and a secretary’s office.  A master plan for future improvements is being worked out.  Daily patient numbers rose from average 10.1 in 1962-63 to 14.9.  [Sic: but presumably this must be to 14.9 in 1962-63.]  Outpatients rose from 430 to 454.  Births fell to 59.

[Acknowledgement was given to the Women’s Auxiliary and the Fund Raising Committee.]

Last year the cropping program raised £583.  Seasonal conditions have not permitted any seeding this year.  Improvements this year have been new cupboards, a new electric bell system, new mattresses, blankets and chairs and a range of new fittings and furnishings.  The surrounds were also improved.  Matron Fyfe and Secretary H.L. Foote continue to offer excellent and efficient service, as do the rest of the staff.  Over 900 polio injections were given in the year.

E.W. Dunhill

Andrew King & Heather Bellman at Chamberlain Field Day at Saddleworth.

Mr E.W. Dunhill (89) has completed 72 years of service as a lay preacher – a record unequalled in the Methodist Church in Australia.  Mr Dunhill was born at Kersbrook in SA and in his early life went to WA.  He married there in 1908 and returned to SA in 1909, taking up residence in Burra in 1915.  He carried on business as a blacksmith for 65 years until he was 83.  He took his first church service at the age of 16 years 11 months.  He was the first person in Australia to hold a certificate recognising 60 years service as a lay preacher.  He was also active in Sunday school work for many years and was Sunday School Superintendent for 37 years.

Burra Show

There were a record number of entries at 2,600 and the show was a great success despite the day starting out with light showers and a cold south-easterly wind.  Conditions improved later.  The gate takings were £190 and about 2,800 attended.  The Central Command Band attended and was much appreciated.  The British Trade Commissioner visited and was impressed by the standard generally and by that of the cooking in particular.

The Flower Section was outstanding this year.

Horses in Action were the centre of keen competition and of much interest; as usual.

Sideshows were better this year with several tents new to the area.  The small merry-go-round was popular with tiny tots and the bucking horses with the older ones.

Rural Youth Club had a very original collection of noxious weeds.

Industrial displays may have been down in numbers, but were comprehensive and up-to-date.

President Mr Rex Warnes welcomed visitors and the Band and called on Brigadier W.W. Wearne to open the show.

Burra Hospital

Plans for a new private room wing have been drawn up and examined by the Board last week.  The plans are for four private rooms, matron’s office and a secretary-manager’s office.  The building would make the hospital more compact and easier to run.  The cost of the new proposal is estimated at £15,000.  Government subsidy is available on a two for one basis and an appeal has been launched to raise the £5,000 needed.  It would be a continuation of the present Women’s Ward, extending out and beyond the men’s yard, with a verandah.  It would have an entrance hall between it and the Women’s Ward.  It would harmonise aesthetically with the Women’s Ward and would improve the overall ‘semmetry’ [sic] of the hospital with a balanced frontage and common entrance for visitors.

Donations to date: £372-10-0.

Characteristics of the paper for 1963

This year was something of a mixed bag.  Sometimes it seems reasonably comprehensive, but at other times it is rather thin on local news.  Almost all the news is carried on page 1 except for sports results, which dominate the rest of the paper.  Pictures appear regularly, but as the blocks were not made locally, the pictures are at least a week later than the events.

Page 1

News: ranging from Hallett-Terowie to Tiverton-Tarlee.

Pages 2 & 3

Smaller advertisements dominate – sales, public notices, coming events, entertainment, films, tenders and smaller business advertisements.

Pages 4-8

Dominated by larger advertisements – mostly local.

News is dominated by sports and occupies perhaps two of the seven columns.

Somewhere in the mix, but wandering from page to page, is a ‘Cash Column’ of small advertisements similar to classified ads.

Note: The volume numbers are chaotic.

Volume 86 runs from 8 January to 26 February

The issue on 5 March is Volume 37

Volume 86 then continues from 12 March to 23 July

It is followed by Volume 80 from 30 July to 1 October

Volume 85 runs from 8 October to the end of the year.

This in turn creates chaos with the numbering of issues.

Burra Carols by Candlelight raised £120 for Freedom From Hunger.  It was held at the War Memorial Oval on 22 December.  Attendance was c. 750.  5AD Radio compere Charles Norton was MC and R.V. Mueller led the Burra & District Choral Society.  After 9.30 p.m. gusty winds and a few spots of rain slightly marred the otherwise very successful occasion.  The Mayor Mr Baulderstone donated the soft drinks’ profit to the cause and he also delivered his Christmas message.  Mrs Odgers of the Catholic Church suggested the idea and the Methodist and Anglican Churches eagerly responded.  Father Hughes, Rector Drought and Rev. Jenner worked together on the planning committee.  The Mayor made the point that this coming together of Catholic and Protestant effort was a significant point in the town’s history.  The combined choir had been practising for some weeks under the High School Headmaster Mr Mueller.

Mr E.T. Baulderstone has a bumper crop of onions this year in his Quarry Street garden.  On an area of just less than a square chain he produced three tons, equivalent to 30 tons per acre, when 20 tons per acre is considered a good rate.

Burra Hospital Building Appeal has reached £5,182-13-8.

Burra Youth Club camp at the Gorge on Sunday had to cope with a temperature of 108°F and a similar temperature was reached on Monday.

Weather.  The year ended with only 115 points for the last three months, to make it the driest final quarter for 75 years.

Burra High School held its Speech Night in the Burra Town Hall on 17 December.  Headmaster R. Mueller delivered his annual report.

The enrolment in January was 151, up 7 on 1962.  First Year numbers were lower, but retention was better in the upper years.  First Year 53, Second Year 56, Intermediate 26 and Leaving 16.  In 1965 c. 170 are expected – an increase due to an anticipated increase in Intermediate to 40.  Numbers are expected to plateau briefly and then decline slightly in 1966.  In 1963 Mr J. Sladden and Mr R. Hillman were transferred and in 1964 Mr T. O’Connor came from Salisbury High and Mr J. Ayliffe and Miss M. Callier came from Teachers’ College.  Mr W. Standing and Miss B. Hogan were appointed Junior Teachers.  During the year Mrs Bogisch resigned and was replaced by Mrs Aistrope from Riverton to handle Home Science.  At the end of this year Miss Lawes and Mr McElroy will be transferred and Junior Teachers Barbara Hogan and Bill Standing will attend Teachers’ College in 1964.

Rev. Jenner and his wife are also leaving and we thank them for taking 90 students each week for Religious Instruction.  Rector Drought and Father Hughes are also thanked.

The High School Council has kept the machinery going without having a particularly busy year.

The Parents & Friends’ Association continues to be efficiently run and the completion of the sports area in front of the school is the culmination of one of their major projects.

In sports the outstanding event of the year was the winning of the Open Shield (the Ohlmeyer Shield) at the Mid North Combined High schools Sports Day.  Burra also got the highest points for the Handicap Shield, but the rules prevent the holding of both shields in the same year.

A school excursion of over 300 miles was in part a reward for this effort.  Places visited included Para and Warren Reservoirs, Mt Crawford Pine Forest, Mannum, Murray Bridge and Mt Lofty.

In February the whole school travelled by train to see the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.  Other successful occasions were the Annual Swimming Carnival, Sports Day, Prefects’ Induction, Arbor Day and Visiting Day.

The Intermediate and Leaving classes travelled to Adelaide and Clare to see performances of plays they were studying.  Leaving Teaching Scholarships were awarded to:

Peter Benger	Barry Carpenter	Kerry Costello

Raelene Hirschausen	Claire Kellock	Margaret Murphy

Pam Zanker

For the second year the school magazine has been printed out of the school.

In 1962 134 subjects were passed in the Intermediate.  (The highest number previously had been 111.)  Leaving passes were the second highest ever.  Keith Neill had the best Leaving results with six subjects and Barbara Hogan with five.  In Intermediate Peter Benger passed 8 subjects and was awarded the A.B .Riggs Prize and Patricia Ryan passed seven subjects.

[Mr Mueller then went on to discuss the non-Publicly Examined Subjects to be offered in 2nd and 3rd Year and their internal assessment.  He thought the Intermediate would fall into disuse with the new Leaving and Matriculation Exams to come into operation from 1966.]

Burra is not going to have these new courses in 1964, but will do so in the next few years.

In 1958 the enrolment was 70 and next year we expect 170.  This has meant a number of new buildings.  In the last year a modern laboratory and a classroom were added.  There are now six classrooms, Home Science and Woodwork Centres, a Science Laboratory, a Typing room and an assembly hall.  The old laboratory will soon be converted to a staff room.  The area around the new rooms is yet to be paved.  The toilets have been enlarged and improved.  The old tennis courts have been extended, resurfaced and fenced this year.  A fence was also erected around the lawn and 80ft of seating was provided.  The school now has four basketball courts instead of one, four tennis courts instead of two and two new practice cricket pitches.  The graded area has been sown and watered and has greatly improved facilities for athletics training, softball and football in the future.

New buses have been provided for the students.  The increase in numbers has seen the appointment of more specialist teachers and a sound range of subjects and Leaving subjects no longer have to be combined with other classes as in the past.

Burra Mine. The SA Government survey has found encouraging signs in its search for copper at the Burra Mine and has decided to spend a further £8,000 in addition to the £10,000 already spent.  The bore is down to 812 ft and will now be taken further.  Drilling is difficult as the bore has to be cased.  Polarisation techniques have indicated three anomalies worth further investigation.

Wool.  A price war has begun between synthetic fibres and wool, with makers of ‘Terylene’ cutting prices significantly.  This threatens wool prices.

W. Young has decided to end his services on the World’s End School Bus run after 8½ years.  We understand Mr W. Robinson will take over the service.

Burra Silos

The new wheat silo at Burra Railway Station took its first grain on 9 December 1963 and filled within seven days.  Heavy intakes began on 13 December and by the 20th the capacity of 100,000 bushels had been reached.  [Daily intake figures are printed.]  Since then there has been direct loading via the conveyor to the rail trucks, which elevates the grain at 70 tons per hour.  Trucks carrying 40 tons can be loaded in 15 minutes.  [This doesn’t seem to conform to the rate cited.]  Inferior wheat still has to be bagged and stacked.  With silos filled throughout the country there is not the storage space to separate hard and FAQ wheat and this will cost growers 3d to 4d per bushel on their hard wheat.  At Burra only 12,000 bushels have been able to be taken and trucked directly as hard wheat, with the rest taken as FAQ.  Wheat came first from the early harvest areas of Peterborough, Yarcowie and beyond Spalding and this meant that some Burra District wheat had to go to silos at Farrell Flat, Saddleworth, or even Wallaroo and Adelaide.  The Burra silo has taken 200,000 bushels so far this season, with some 20,000 still to come.  Photo of loading wheat into a railway truck.

Weather.  A severe storm struck Burra last Wednesday afternoon and deposited up to an inch of rain in fifteen minutes.  Most shopkeepers suffered some stock damage when gutters failed to cope with the flow, but little water entered tanks, as most was lost over the edge of gutters.  Some shops and homes lost roofing iron and many homes suffered damage to floor coverings when water entered houses.  The Burra Hospital had water through it and suffered minor damage, though much cleaning up was required.  Burra officially recorded 68 points in the storm and 94 points for the day.  Some properties recorded up to 150 points.

Lightning caused many fires.  Most were extinguished almost at once, but two or three acres were burnt in some places.  Across the town reported falls varied from 150 points on the west side to 50 on the east.

Trevor Richardson in his school bus loaded with children was in the midst of it when the storm broke along Johnson’s Creek with hail and flying tree branches.  At its peak the bus was being blown along in second gear with its engine off.  He had stopped to clear debris from the road.  Just after crossing a creek to join the old Adelaide Road a great wall of water came down it.  Princess Royal shearing shed lost its verandah, which was carried some 500-600 yards.

Photographs: two photos show Johnson’s Creek area before and after the storm.

In that area dozens of large gum trees were uprooted and smashed to pieces.  Others were stripped of every leaf, twig and branch, leaving only the main trunk.  The destruction was in a strip along the creek for a mile with another line of it running over the hills towards the homestead and another leading west.

[This would seem to be describing a tornado.]

It was decided to ask the Governor to open the 1964 show.  Elected: Patron, G. Stanley Hawker; President, Rex C. Warnes; Vice-Presidents B.A. Riggs & M. G. Stockman.

Report on the 1963 Show.

Gate takings were £190 and £30 came from a dance organised by Rural Youth in the Show Hall.  The show was opened by Brigadier W.W. Wearne OBE, Commander of Central Command and the Central Command Band also attended.  Membership has increased slightly.  The financial position is sound, but needs watching.  It was decided to increase admission charges by 1/-.  Secretary Mr Perry resigned during the year and we thank Mr & Mrs Barry Taylor for taking over that role.  There were 2,610 entries for the 1963 Show.

Burra High School.  Three Leaving students sat for Supplementary Exams and this brings to 13 the number of certificates gained by 14 students and a further certificate was completed.  Pam Zanker, who had been awarded an English Q, passed English, Barry Carpenter passed English and Valerie Donhardt passed Modern History.  English Qs were awarded to Ray Pietsch & Arnold Lomman, who had both passed six subjects and who now get an Intermediate Certificate.

Pooraka Wool Pty Ltd will open a wool depot in Burra.  Mr Dudley Cockington will be appointed to purchase wool, skins, hides (including kangaroo), tallow, beeswax, etc.  If receivals warrant a wool cleaning and crushing plant could be installed, which would provide local employment.

[A half-page advertisement on page 3 indicates that the company had acquired the old Power House as a site for their operations.]

Obituary.  Dr D. McDonald Steele died recently aged 78.  He was the first President of the Burra High School Council.  He came to Burra after graduating in 1909 and practised here for over 30 years.  He took great interest in the welfare of Burra High School and was President of the High School Council for 26 years.  He was also interested in golf, tennis and bowls in Burra.  Since retiring to Adelaide he often visited the district in connection with his Koo-owie Stud and it was only last year that he finally relinquished his interest in that property, when it was sold to Barton Hill Proprietors.  In 1962 he was to have been a guest speaker at a High School Jubilee function, but was prevented by illness from attending.  He did attend the High School speech night in 1962 in December and gave an interesting address.  At the recent High School swimming Carnival, at which Steele House won the cup, a minute’s silence was observed.  He is survived by a widow and two sons, Dr D.M. Steele of Strathalbyn and Mr J.R. Steele and also by one daughter Mrs George Mollard-Humphrys.  He was cremated at Centennial Park after a service at St Matthew’s Church.

[The paper then reprints Dr Steele’s views on education from the History of Burra High School.  He was answering a view of a Professor who deplored wasting money educating the masses.  Dr Steele said: ‘It might be dangerous to educate the masses, but personally, he felt it right to give the boys and girls every chance, this was a duty parents owed the child and the nation.’]

Burra Hospital has installed an oil-fired boiler to supply 270 gallons of hot water per hour for the new laundry and all other requirements.  It replaces an inadequate coke boiler at a cost of £1,505 (subsidised on a two for one basis).  The old boiler was left in place and so the hospital was without hot water for less than four hours.  There is a 500 gallon tank for oil.

Burra Mine

Officers of the Department of Mines are hampered in their testing and searching at the mine by incomplete records of the old workings and they are seeking any help available.  Having used drilling and induced polarisation, they are now using the geochemical method, but are hampered by a lack of factual information in the mine workings below the open cut.  If any local or former resident of Burra has any old plans or reports etc. they would be gratefully received.  They would particularly like any first hand knowledge of the two diamond drill test holes put down in the vicinity of the open cut in about 1900.  One was completed in 1897 and the other early in 1900, but the exact locations are not known.  Details from a log book would be valuable.  It would be wonderful if findings warranted the opening of operations in the area.  Geochemical prospecting relies on the changes in the composition of overlying soils caused by the decay of the bedrock.  Soil movement and ground water movement mean the minerals sought are in trace element proportions.

Mr Don Zanker, accountant at the ANZ Bank in Burra for 2½ years, has been transferred to Millicent.  He has been active in many areas particularly in the Memorial Oval project.  He has also been secretary of the Football Club for two years and of the Lawn Tennis Club and is presently Chairman of the Primary School Committee.  He will be replaced by Mr Don Ebsary from Naracoorte, who has been at Burra before, about eight years ago.  His wife was formerly Coralie Ellis, who also worked at the Burra branch at that time.

The Highways Department has offered to take over the main roads in the town:

Entrance from Adelaide down Commercial Street

Kingston Street to Mr H. White’s

Market Square [sic: actually Market Street] through to the Racecourse [including Bests Place, Young Street and Watt Road.]

Burra War Memorial Oval Committee has sanctioned spending up to £250 for a bore to supply water to the oval.  The high cost of E & WS water has so far limited improvements to the oval.  The cost of reticulation etc. would be a later additional charge.  A.C. Thomas has offered either free boring for 25 ft of a rebate of £50 – the normal cost of drilling being £2 per foot, including casing.

Obituary.  Mr William George Terry, who died suddenly at his home in Burra North on 31 March, was born at Broken Hill 7 January 1902.  He was the eldest son of Mr & Mrs William Terry and moved to Burra in 1911 when Mr Terry Sen. became manager of Sturt Vale Station.  He completed his schooling at Gawler and returned to work at Sturt Vale before taking work with the District Council.  Later he joined the tailoring staff of the late E.C. Hammond, whose business he acquired in 1930 and which he continued in until 1962.  He was active in the town’s sporting activities and in community affairs.  He was a keen bowler and was Burra Bowling Club’s singles champion several times.  He was instrumental in forming the North Eastern Bowling Association and skippered a mixed rink at the recent Easter Tournament to second place, only a few hours before his death.  He was secretary of the Burra Racing Club for some time before ill health forced him to retire.  He is survived by his widow Edith nee Harris, son Jim of Sydney and daughter Val. Mrs John Taylor of Tarlee.  There are four grandchildren.  His two surviving brothers are Jack of Burra and Tom of Adelaide.

The main project for this year is a dressing shed for the girls.

In the year £335 was given to improve the old tennis courts and surroundings.  The Ball raised £87-11-4.  With the increasing number of High School students it has been necessary to limit the Christmas Banquet to staff, students and the President of the High School Council and it was decided to dispense with the services of a guest speaker, so making the event somewhat less formal.  Sporting equipment was purchased throughout the year for the school.

On 24 June 1937 he married Miss Rosa Wittwer at St Peter’s church, Point Pass.  They had seven children.  In his youth he played cricket for World’s End and football for Apoinga, but his great love was rifle shooting and he took an active interest in the Burra Rifle Club, winning many trophies, including Club champion and the Baldina Trophy for yearly aggregate as recently as 1955.  He represented Burra with other members in the big shoots in Sydney in the late 1930s.  He was a foundation member of the Burra Small Bore Club and active in the early years of its existence.

Mothers & Babies’ Health Association.  Lady Bonython opened the new clinic on 27 April.  The building required a further £270 to be free of debt.  Lady Bonython is State President of the M & BHA.  Upon arrival she was entertained at luncheon at the Kooringa Hotel.  The Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone attended the opening, despite being the only male present.  Local Association President Mrs R.B. Jennison welcomed the visitor and called on Lady Bonython to open the door.  It is seven years since clinic services opened in Burra and the number of mothers and babies using the service has increased every year.  Mrs Jennison said she could not mention the individual names of the many who had helped, but she did single out Mr Baulderstone who made the Mayor’s Parlour available for the clinic and Mr [R.] Fuss, without whose help, advice and labour it would have been practically impossible to open the building.  The aid of the CWA has also been greatly appreciated, along with the husbands of the committee members.  The M & BHA now has 84 buildings.  It had started in 1909, when it was called ‘The School for Mothers’.  It was started by Dr Helen Mayo with some helpers because she was appalled at the infant mortality rate, which was then over 70 per 1,000 births.  Last year it was 18.67.

ETSA intends to build a modern office and depot in Burra, with a permanent maintenance staff and a small construction gang stationed here.

It will serve the area from Ulooloo almost to Morgan in the southeast and will include Hallett, Booborowie, Hanson, Burra and Robertstown.  It will maintain two major transmission lines providing power to the Upper Murray.

Mr Howard Griffen of Mt Bryan has developed a fleece weighing table.  The table measures 10 ft x 5 ft and weighs up to 30 lb.  It has been under test at the Agricultural Research Station Trangie and results suggest it would be a sound purchase where fleece measurement was an integral part of the breeding program.  Tests show it to be as accurate as a standard balance, allowing for the fact that some locks will fall through when a fleece is thrown onto the table – the difference from the pan weight being between nil and 0.2 lb.  Overall it was accurate and simplified the board boy’s routine.  A NSW firm has agreed to manufacture the table.

Accident.  A semi-trailer rolled onto its side in Market Square on Sunday when its load shifted.  The driver Mr J.L. Carroll of Prospect did a good job in managing to avoid the War Memorial when the load of pre-fabricated huts, destined for Moree in NSW, shifted as he turned from Commercial Street into Market Square heading north.  The driver was not injured.  Numerous people took photos. A crane arrived from Adelaide on Monday morning to unload the vehicle and right it.  The vehicle was driven off once it regained its wheels with damage of only £30-£40.  Damage to the huts was also slight and it is thought that spectators damaged more roses than the accident itself.  Alan Baulderstone removed a dozen or more to save them and 19 of the 48 are still standing.

Obituary.  Mr Arthur James Prior died at the Repatriation General Hospital Springbank, Adelaide 26 June aged 76.  He was born at Burra North on 11 July 1887 of parents who were both born in Burra. His father was the late Elijah Thomas Prior who was born in 1861 and his mother nee Elizabeth Owens was born in 1857 and lived to 93, dying in Adelaide in 1950.  He father was one of the original Burra miners and she was born and lived for some years in the old miners’ dugouts in the banks of the Burra Creek.  Mr Arthur Prior lived for many years in the district and later in Burra itself.  Before WWI he worked on farming and station properties in the Burra, Mt Bryan and Gumbowie districts and was employed for a number of years by the late Mr John Collins of Collinsville.  He enlisted in WWI and served in France with the 48th Battalion.  He was wounded in the Bullecourt Campaign and was taken prisoner by the Germans.  He spent almost two years as a POW and suffered great hardships.  After the war he returned to the Burra district with his brother Gilbert, who had been wounded on the same day and in the same battle in France, but who had been repatriated to Australia some time before him.  He took up farming as a soldier settler in the Springbank area and at Hanson and was successful until selling out just before WWII.  For some years Mr Prior than conducted a confectionery business in Market Square in the premises now occupied by Mr Alan Baulderstone.  After selling that premises he went into retirement in Adelaide for about 12 years.  He never married.  He is survived by four sisters and three brothers.

Burra Cemetery

For many years the condition of the cemetery has caused the Council concern and has been the subject of much criticism.  Legal issues have hampered Council action.  There has been a long wait for approval to reclaim and level a portion of the area.  Much research had to be done into particulars of leases, dates of burials etc. and many letters were sent to the concerning authorities.  Moves for the central portion of the cemetery to be levelled commenced six years ago and approval to carry out the work has finally been given.  Tracing lessees of blocks or members of the family concerned, calling for objections and so on has taken all that time.  Last week the Council, with the use of District Council plant, commenced the levelling work.  Large shrubs, large trees, broken and crumbling mounds, have been removed and the area flattened.  There is a large heap of rubbish to be burnet and the headstones removed will be placed along the boundary wall.  A vast improvement is already evident.  The 99 year leases on the blocks in this area had already expired.  New laws grant the period of 50 years only for the lease of these blocks.

Tally-Hi Shearing.  Vin Parks, Field Officer with the Australian Wool Board is conducting two shearing schools in the district this week.  They are arranged in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture to teach professional shearers the Tally-Hi method of shearing developed by the Wool Board.

Obituary.  Mr William Garden Gunn died 4 August at the Burra hospital.  He was born at Birkenhead and his father was Harbour Master at Pt Adelaide.  The family attended Port Adelaide Presbyterian Church for many years.  As a lad he went to Victoria to learn farming and returned to SA with his then employer, to live at Mundalla in the South East.  He bought his first property at Booborowie over forty years ago and developed virgin land into a most productive farm for Hunter River Lucerne seed growing.  He gradually increased his acreage and became so well known that orders for his seed came from interstate as well as locally.  He also had a small Friesian Herd.  He was a member of Willalo Methodist Church and a trustee for 32 years.  He is survived by a widow, Rachel Gunn of Melbourne.  [Born William Garden Gunn 26 February 1887 Birkenhead SA: died William Gardner Gunn 4 August 1964 Burra, residence Booborowie.  Since a wife Areta Lizzie Grace nee Chantrill died in 1945, his widow must be a second wife.]

Mr E.W. Dunhill of Burra North completed 73 years of service as a Local Preacher in the Methodist Church on 20 September.  This is a record unparalleled in Australia.  Mr Dunhill was born at Kersbrook and in early life went to WA.  He married there in 1908 and returned to SA in 1909.  He took up residence in Burra in 1915 and carried on a business as a blacksmith for 45 years, relinquishing it only five years ago at the age of 83*.  Mr Dunhill was the first man in Australia to receive a certificate recognising 60 years of service to the Church as a Lay Preacher.  He has also given long service in Sunday school work, with 37 years as Superintendent.  The President of Conference sent a letter of congratulations to Mr Dunhill, who will be 90 on 19 October.

[Clearly this does not accord with his being 90 in October.]

Obituary.  Alfred Stanley Barrett

Mr Barrett was born at Goodwood in 1887.  He was a member of the gifted Barrett family which conducted many evangelical meetings throughout the state.  When he joined his brothers he played the music at their meetings and the elder brothers gave the messages.  He became a Home Missionary and worked on Home Mission Stations where his practical help in building Churches was appreciated.  He was received into the Ministry in 1919 and ordained in 1923.  He worked in churches in the following circuits: Penong, Lameroo, Tailem Bend, Kulpara, Tumby Bay, Broken Hill, Minlaton, Nairne, Burra, Quorn and Woodside.  He married Miss Alice Whitbread on 20 August 1914.  His wife greatly assisted in the ministry.  Ill health forced his retirement, but he continued to do the work of his ministry through writing.  The funeral service was held in Redruth Methodist Church on Saturday and was conducted by the President of the Sa Conference Rev. B.H. Phillips, assisted by Chairman of the District Rev. C.F. Wells and the local minister Rev. M.A. Lind.

R.C. Flockhart, who followed Rev. Wilson.  The building served for 66 years before being replaced in 1914 under the direction of Rev. J.H. Nield.  A capacity crowd of 400 filled the church to commence the three day celebration of its opening.  Guests at the time included the President of the SA Conference, Rev. G. Hall, the Rev. Samuel Knight (a former minister), Rev. Henry Howard (a notable preacher from Pirie St Methodist Church, Adelaide) and His Honour the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Way, whose father was a Primitive Methodist Minister in Burra.

Kooringa Methodist Church Golden Jubilee

Members past and present filled the church on Sunday 4 October for the Jubilee Service.  The Resident Minister Rev. M.A. Lind conducted the morning service.  In 1914 the late Rev. J.C .Jennison had read the Old Testament Lesson and at the Jubilee his grandson Mr Ray Jennison read the lesson in his stead.  Sir Philip McBride, who was the first bridegroom married in the present building, read the New Testament Lesson.  The guest preacher was the Rev. G.C. Hutchinson, ex-President of the Methodist Conference and Kooringa Minister from 1933-36.

Mr & Mrs Robert Broad acted as Host and Hostess at the luncheon.  Mr Broad is Trust Secretary.  The ladies of the church catered for 160 guests.  The afternoon was a great time for reunion.  Among the large congregation for the Evening Service were Rev. R. Jenner, the immediate past minister and his family and Rev. M.S. Martin and his family.  The Jubilee of the building was also the Kooringa Church’s 118th Anniversary.  The guest speaker again gave the address.  Supper followed in the hall.

Weather.  The paper reports 117 points of rain so far for October.  This it says is for the past week, but does not include Saturday for some reason, even though the report of the show on the same page says it rained persistently.  Then in a postscript it adds that 15 points fell before 9 a.m. on Saturday and a further 36 points to 9 a.m. Monday.

Daisy Kennedy and Mr A.L. Kennedy

This brother and sister returned to Burra for a visit, having left the town in 1895.  Daisy was born at the Commercial Hotel in 1893.

‘She was to become the world’s greatest violinist of her day.’

She went abroad for her training and stayed overseas, although she made a number of triumphant tours of Australia after 1914.  The family lived in a house in Kangaroo Street (now occupied by Mr & Mrs M.W. Eberhard and family).  She also had a look at the school where her father was headmaster from 1892 to 1895.  Her brother Mr A.L. Kennedy, who accompanied her, was one of Mawson’s companions on his Antarctic journeys.  Later he surveyed the vast area of the Kimberley in WA and became one of Australia’s leading geologists and mineralogists.  The pair spent an hour visiting their old home in Kangaroo Street, where they met Mrs Eberhard’s mother, Mrs Quinn, who had been at school with A.L. Kennedy.  Daisy Kennedy was first married to the great pianist Benna Mosceiwitsh and then to John Drinkwater, the English poet, writer and playwright.  She now lives in London and her brother in WA.

[Of the six Kennedy children, only Daisy Fowler Kennedy was born in Burra (Kooringa) 16 January 1893.  Alexander Lorimer Kennedy had been born 23 April 1889 at Woodside.]

Burra Show 1964

The show last Saturday was opened by the Governor Sir Edric Bastyan.  Attendance was about 2,000 and the gate takings were £179, only about £10 below 1963 despite a showery morning and a persistently wet afternoon.  Previous rain meant the grounds were probably the wettest ever underfoot.  Despite this the crowds came and ring events and other activities continued.  The SA Police Band made a small contribution at the opening, but was otherwise prevented from performing by the rain and returned to the city at about 3 p.m.  The Governor opened the show at about 12.45 p.m.  He arrived in the morning and stayed at the Commercial Hotel, due to the changed arrangements because of the weather.  There he was surprised to find himself speaking Arabic with Mr Rasheed.  After the Governor’s speech [which is printed] the band played The Song of Australia and the official party then adjourned for luncheon.  After lunch the Governor toured all the exhibits and watched some of the ring events.

Industrial displays occupied more space than for many years.

Side shows were more numerous, but patronage was quiet due to the rain.

The Schools’ Display was a fine effort and Rural Youth had a display on Bush Fire Prevention.

Young’s Caterers of Melrose did an excellent job with the catering.

The Rural Youth Club organised a dance in the pavilion in the evening and door takings were £22.

Kindergarten Day in Burra, 13 November

Last Friday the Hon. Sir Bruce Ross LLB officially opened the newly registered Kindergarten in the morning and in the afternoon the Christmas Tree Carnival in the Town Hall.  The functions were well attended and the District Ladies’ Organisations raised £190.  The official party at the Kindergarten comprised: Sir Bruce Ross & Lady Ross; Mrs R.B. Pitcher, President of the Burra Branch; Miss Mellor, Superintendent of Kindergartens; The Mayor & Mayoress, Mr & Mrs E.T. Baulderstone; Mr Rex Warnes & Mrs Warnes; Mr L.A. Beinke President of the Burra Air Force Association and Mr G.R. Finch, Chairman of Burra Burra DC.  [The punctuation makes it unclear whether Rex Warnes or L.A. Beinke was President of the AFA, but I am not aware Rex Warnes was in the RAAF.]

Mrs Pitcher welcomed the guests.  She thanked Mrs J. Carpenter for her great effort in getting the Kindergarten started and the Air Force Association for granting a 20 year lease at £1 p.a.  Sir Bruce Ross said Mrs Carpenter had started the effort with a small band of children in the Methodist Church Hall and as interest grew it was decided to join the Kindergarten Union, which was done on 1 April 1964.  The Kindergarten began with half day periods, but now two afternoons have been added and no less than 43 young children attend.  He unveiled a plaque and opened the door.  Sir Bruce said the first Kindergarten had been founded in SA in 1906 and by 1945 there were still only 10, but now there were 119.  Sir Bruce Ross also opened the Christmas Tree Carnival in the Town Hall.  The best exhibit was the entry of the ‘Eastern Dorcas Society’.  [Photo in 87, 47 (3) 24 Nov. 1964.]  Takings for the day amounted to £190.  [Kindergarten or Christmas Tree: or are they the same thing as far as the money goes?

Mr Wayne Dodds is slowly recovering from his fall.  He suffered concussion, a fractured pelvis and ankle, a punctured bladder and broke all his left ribs.

Mr J.R. Barker of Baldina has found an interesting item on his property.  It was a pile of thin plastic 12-15 ft across and 2 ft high and far too heavy to lift.  Attached to either end was a solid round cylinder and to one of them a long nylon rope was fixed.  It appears likely to have been a large tethered balloon, perhaps 100 ft across, which has escaped from somewhere.  So far no one has reported seeing it in flight.

Remembrance Day was commemorated on 11 November at the Fallen Soldiers’ Memorial in Market Square.  Rev. Lind officiated at the service and wreaths were laid by representatives of the RSL, AFA, Demobilised Soldiers’ Association, the District & Town Councils and the Pensioners’ League.  [Rev. Lind’s address is printed.]

Burra Hospital

Last Friday afternoon the Hon. Sir Lyell McEwin opened the new building at the Burra Hospital.  The Vice-Chairman of the Hospital Board Mr Eric Ashby introduced the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone, who extended a welcome to Sir Lyell.  The Mayor said that Burra had played an important part in the economy of SA for almost 120 years, first through the days of the copper mine and later with the sheep industry.  The Mayor also welcomed Mr G. Gilfillan, Matron Croeser and two Hospital Inspectors, Messrs O’Donnell & Kelly.  He also welcomed the presence of Miss Siegele who took up duties at the Hospital in 1924 and was appointed Matron six months later.  She held the position for ten years.  Mrs Peak and the Misses G. & E. Williams were representatives of pioneer families.  Mrs Peal and Miss Gertrude Williams were daughters of Mrs E.C. Williams nee Kathryn Watson, the first fully trained nurse at the Hospital, who came from England in 1876.  Other Hospitals were also represented at the opening.

Mr Ron Pearse spoke as Chairman of the Hospital Board.  He said Sir Lyell had been the obvious choice to open the building, not just because he was Chief Secretary and Minister of Health, but also because he had taken a personal interest in the Hospital.

Sir Lyell recalled earlier visits as the work was in progress and visits too when Dr Steele was in the town and the hospital faced drainage problems and all sorts of embarrassments. Out of these troubles had emerged the most attractive development seen today.  Burra was one of about three places which had started a hospital before any assistance was available from Government.  [He went on to recount how Government had moved from a pound for pound subsidy to a two pound for one pound subsidy and that subsidies now also covered furnishings and other items, which had only gained such recognition in recent years.]

Sir Lyell went on to praise the development plan for the Hospital and of course the Government policies supporting hospitals generally and their equipment.  He had words of praise for the contractor Mr Mass and the architect Messrs Stapledon [sic] & Michael.  He also had praise for the staff and the Women’s auxiliary and the Board of Management.

Mr Glen Finch moved a vote of thanks to Sit Lyell, which was seconded by Dr L.G. Miller.

Mr Pearse then handed Mrs John Gebhardt and Mrs Andrew Tennant Honorary Life Membership Certificates.

Burra High School Speech Night

Headmaster R. Mueller’s Report for 1964.

The School re-opened with an enrolment of 185, up 34 on 1963.  This is due to the retention of students in the upper school, possibly influenced by the raising of the school leaving age to 15.  It is likely the future enrolment will fluctuate around the 200 mark.  Staff changes: Miss N. Lawes resigned to change her name to McElroy.  Mr B. McElroy transferred to Gilles Plains.  Miss A. Aistrope moved to Adelaide.  Miss E. McCabe went overseas and Miss B. Hogan and Mr W. Standing were appointed to Teachers’ College.  Mr K. Hicks was transferred to Nuriootpa during the year.  Mr R. Wright came from Gladstone, Mr I. Norton from Salisbury, Mr E. Johns & Miss L. Briggs were appointed from Teachers’ College. Local, Miss P. Zanker, was appointed a Junior Teacher.  Mr Heywood from Streaky Bay replaced Mr Hicks.  This year we have been informed that Senior Master Mr O’ Connor, is moving to Peterborough.  Miss Callier is moving to Darwin.  Mr Johns is also being transferred.  Miss Zanker moves to Teachers’ College.  I am being transferred to Naracoorte.  Replacements for 1965 will be Mr Farrow as Headmaster from AHS, Mr Brand from Peterborough as Senior Master and Mr Morris as Junior Assistant.

The High School Council has given the school sound support under Mr Jennison’s leadership.

The Parent & Friends’ Association has been very active.  They provided afternoon tea for Sports Day and arranged a most successful Ball (profit £100).  Tomorrow they will provide a sit-down banquet in this hall for over 200.  £200 has been spent on library books and physical education equipment.  The prefects have set a high standard of conduct and served the school well.

The successful Swimming Carnival was won by Steele House.

There was a whole school excursion to Renmark via Truro, Blanchetown, Waikerie, Kingston, Berri and Morgan.  Many people are thanked for the provision of transport.

The variety evening performance in the Town Hall was an innovation, which proved very successful and raised over £30 for the magazine fund.  Many parents and friends took advantage of the visiting day.

The Intermediate Class visited Clare to see a performance of The Merchant of Venice.

Last week an Advertiser tennis coaching school was run on the school’s tennis courts.

Clubs were introduced this year: public speaking, Red Cross, gymnastics, motor mechanics, musical appreciation, athletics, clay modelling and dramatics.

Burra won the Handicap Shield at the Inter-High School Sports.

The school won £40 from the Savings Bank Award.

Various speakers addressed the school about employment prospects.  A new tennis wall has been erected on the Statton Sports Area and a large area asphalted for playing space.  The newly developed playing ground is covering well with grass.  Books worth £170 have been added to the library and £100 worth of physical equipment has been purchased.  A new record player has been purchased.  Some improvements have been made to toilets and others await completion.  Approval has been given to convert the old laboratory to a staff room, but so far this has not happened.  Other approvals have been for a new change room, a chain wire boundary fence and repainting.

PEB results in 1963 were outstanding with an 88% Leaving subject pass rate and 84% for Intermediate subjects.  In Leaving 14 of the 15 candidates gained certificates and in Intermediate 15 of the 22.  Dianne Wood is congratulated for obtaining a Continuation Exhibition and the A.B. Riggs Award.

Obituary.  Roy William Lloyd died suddenly 25 November.  He was born at Erskine 10 May 1895 to pioneering Methodist parents who instilled in him and all their children the great wealth of Christian character.  Roy came to this district as a child with his parents, who took up the property known as Braefoot.  He began his education at Erskine and finished it at Copperhouse.  He was deeply respected in the community.  In WWI he enlisted in the AIF and served in the 32nd Battalion in France and Belgium and on his return took up a Soldiers’ Settlement Farm at Flagstaff.  On March 16 ‘of that year’ [sic: for 1927] he married Annie May Morgan in the Ironmine Methodist Church.  Roy Lloyd had that rare gift of dependability and was often selected as a spokesman.  His leadership was noticeable in his WWI service and in WWI, in which he gave service in the VDC. The Methodist Church, especially at Ironmine pays tribute to his unassuming service.  He gave great support to the interests of young people and supported also the RSL.  He contributed a unique service to the community through his gift of water divining and over 100 bores and windmills stand as a memorial to this gift.  He is survived by his widow and four children: Colin, Mary Mrs Don White, Claire Mrs Athol Tiver and Donald.  There are eight grandchildren.

Burra Hospital

The speech made by Mr R. Pearse, Chairman of the Board, at the opening of the new hospital building, is printed.

He thanked the staff for handling all the inconveniences during building operations without complaint.  The District Council and its employees also provided unpaid help.  The Town Council attended to cleaning of the footpaths and streets associated with the building.  The doctors also spent much time giving aid and advice.  The Board members and the Secretary Mr H. Foote also contributed a great deal of time and effort.  The architects are commended for blending the new building in with the old.  The public also had a huge role to play by contributing £5,000 between 29 October and 16 December 1963.  Further contributions would be welcome because over the past 12 months costs have increased between 20 & 25%.  Mr Pearse then said a few words on the history of the hospital.  The first hospital [Bleak House] was built by the mining company, just the other side of the old power house.  In 1876 the Burra Hospital was formed in what had been the original Burra hotel, then owned by the licensee Mr Alfred Barker.  (Mr John Barker is a grandson and the only family representative in the district today.)  Later Men’s and Women’s Wards were added, followed by a theatre block and some private rooms.  Later still, through the courtesy of Mr James Gallagher, an Isolation Block was added. (His child was the first patient there.)  In 1924 the Maternity Wing was added.  A major plan for redevelopment was formulated in 1953 and the Nurses’ Home was erected.  This plan’s other aspects were not proceeded with and the present Board thought it rather too big for the present needs of the district and the cost would have been excessive.  The present building is stage one of three of the new plan for redevelopment.  Next the pantry will be modernised.  The aim is to reduce the number of levels in the hospital.  We want to alter the theatre block and casualty to place all on one level, except for the Maternity Wing.

Mrs Alice Peak & Miss Gertrude Williams attended the hospital opening and reported on Nurse Catherine Watson, who was the first fully trained nurse at the Burra Hospital.  She came from England on the Oaklands in 1876 as a nurse, attending on one of the passengers.  She had intended to return, but instead agreed to go to Burra.  She found conditions primitive at the converted hotel that was the hospital.  Her first meal was on the end of the kitchen table, from a tin plate and pannikin, while the cook did the washing up at the other end.  She soon managed to introduce china for staff and patients.  Rubbish was emptied into a disused shaft on the grounds.  She was bothered by the continuous noise from the ore crushers, but the mines closed down soon after she arrived.  Equipment was minimal and at least one man’s leg was amputated using the meat saw from the kitchen.  Operations were performed on the counter of the old bar.  A typhoid epidemic struck while the railway was being extended to Terowie and so many patients arrived that they had to be accommodated on the floor of the old bar.  The cook had no idea of an invalid diet and provided a thick Scotch broth for the typhoid patients.  Nurse Watson sent the orderly to fetch the doctor.  The orderly was Mr William Wilson, who had resigned from the Police Department and helped Nurse Watson with the male patients.  He held the position for about 20 years until retiring.  Changes came gradually.  The bar was converted to a Women’s Ward.  The long room became the Men’s Ward.  The smaller rooms were assigned to domestic uses.  After two years Nurse Watson decided not to return to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where she had been trained.  She married C.C. Williams.  Soon after this the Hospital purchased its first surgical instruments and Dr Brummitt came and took her to see them.  She was delighted at this advance in the treatment of the sick.

Characteristics of the 1964 paper.

The paper had a standard size of 8 pages of 7 columns, with occasional supplements, but more usually extra material was accommodated by expanding the paper to 10 or even 12 pages.  These expanded issues often had very confusing numbering of the pages.

Most news was carried on page 1 with sport a big part of subsequent pages.  Another feature of other pages was the printing of reports from district towns – Spalding, Farrell Flat and Booborowie in particular, but sometimes from Riverton and Saddleworth.  Spalding was more regularly represented than others.

The layout of the paper was less regular than in earlier years.  The suggested page usage is therefore more approximate than in some years.  Coverage of Burra news seems to be quite reasonable.

Page 1

News

Page 2

Sales advertisements and public notices.  Smaller advertisements. The Cash Column with its smaller classified type of advertisements may appear here, but migrated to almost any of the other pages except page 1.

Page 3

This could be a continuation of page 2 or may be dominated by larger advertisements.  News usually occupies less than one column.

Pages 4-8

Most advertisements are larger; generally at least two columns wide and two inches or more in depth.  News on these pages is usually two to three columns in total and is dominated by sport and/or reports from other parts of the wider district.  Occasionally there are full page advertisements.

Photographs of local events have become more common.  This year some accompany the news reports; rather than being a week or more later.  Some still lag the event.

Photographs are still not included every week, however.

Harvest.  190,000 bushels have been taken at the Burra Silo and the harvest is almost complete.  Rail trucks were loaded yesterday and more are expected today to relieve the position.

R. Fuss of Burra North reports a strange and interesting visitor at the weekend – a porcupine or hedgehog.  Ian Barry and Chris Bevan were playing in the yard and saw it sunning itself in front of the wood shed, where it seems to have established itself.  It appeared several times throughout the day.  Its appearance is a mystery, as they are not known around Burra, but have occasionally been seen at the Gorge at World’s End.  [Presumably an echidna.]

Learn to Swim Campaign.  The Education Department’s campaign is in progress and at Burra 192 are taking part, an increase of 30 on last year.

Weather.  Burra recorded 124 points for December and for 1964 a total of 1,913 points, nearly 2 inches above average, although 33 points less than the 1963 total.

St Andrew’s Anglican Church at Mt Bryan held services on Sunday to celebrate its Golden Jubilee. Rural Dean of Clare Rev. S.M. Smith and Rev. G.D. Sibly of Burra officiated.  A lych-gate has been erected as part of the beautification of the grounds.  [The newly erected Lych-gate is pictured.]  The land for the church was given by W.A. Gebhardt.  He and Mr H.L. Hatherly were the first Wardens of the Church.  The foundation stone was laid and dedication services were conducted by the Broughton Archdeacon Bussell.  The building and furniture cost £650 and the debt of £150 was paid off on 4 February 1921.  The consecration was not carried out till 1933.  This was the second church built in the parish.  (The Black Springs Church was purchased from the Methodists.)  There are two stained glass windows in the Sanctuary.*  One is in memory of Andrew Barker Hooper, who died 28 November 1914.  The altar cross and candlesticks were given by the UNREADABLE Family at Eudunda.  The Sanctuary hangings and altar linen were made and given by Mrs Bloyd (the wife of the Parish Rector in 1915) and Mrs Hatherly.  Several items of furniture have since been added: pews in 1960.  It has twice been renovated; in 1935 at a cost of £95 and in 1958-59 at a cost of £375.  Pine trees planted in the grounds are in memory of parishioners who went to WWI.  The lych-gate and stone path were added in 1964.  The Church is past of the Parish of Burra, which is in the Arch-Deaconry of the Broughton, within the Diocese of Adelaide.  It is anticipated that the Deanery of Broughton will be ceded to strengthen the Diocese of Willochra in 1966.  Present Wardens are G.S. Hawker, People’s Warden from 1949 and M. Collins, Priest’s Warden from 1960.  Rectors of Burra Since St Andrew’s was built have been:

S.J. Bloyd	1910-18	(With F.H. Durford as Assistant Curate in 1915)

F.B. Hewitson	1921-27

Burra Swimming Pool

The Town Council is concerned that several items connected with the filtration plant have not been completed.  The filtration plant began operation on 22 December 1963, but negotiations with the contractor continued to May 1964 with no result.  Then the Council still did not know why the whole thing had not been finalised.  The Club advised the Council that it owed the contractor £496 or 10% of the initial cost.  This meant the Club could not claim £900 of subsidy from the Tourist Bureau because things were not up to scratch and the E & WS would not give a certificate of satisfaction.  Despite repeated visits and specific requests nothing was done and at the December Council meeting it was decided to give until 21 January to have work commenced.  On 18 January a Council meeting resolved to tell the contractor that if work was not completed within 14 days they would have the job completed and debit the cost to him.  This follows legal advice through the Municipal Association.  It should be noted that the problem is not with the actual filtration process, which is quite normal, but refers to ancillary work like cement work, pipe diameter etc.

Burra Sewerage Scheme

Don Wilson Chief Inspector of the Central Board of Health has outlined a sewerage system to serve the main business section of Burra.  It could be operation as early as 1966.  Mr Wilson visited Burra on Wednesday and with the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and Town Clerk W.A. Holness, inspected the shopping area, which has most problems regarding the installation of septic toilets and hand-washing facilities.  A meeting of the Local Board of Health discussed ways and means of overcoming this problem.  Mr Wilson outlined a scheme to provide 50-60 premises with a full sewerage system at a comparatively low cost per owner.  The plan would have one sewerage pipeline commencing at the Post Office Exchange building and extending round to the vicinity of Dr Miller’s residence.  A second would commence at the rear of Jennison’s used car lot and extend along Commercial Street to the main creek, taking in all businesses on the south side of Market Square.  These pipes would connect with a treatment plant on the bank of the creek and effluent could possibly be used for the establishment of trees and shrubs etc.  A similar scheme recently installed for the whole of Berri cost £25,000.  At Berri the effluent is being used on the golf links.  There is no likelihood of unpleasant odours from the treatment plant.  Soakage pits and septic tanks would not be needed on the properties concerned.  It is unlikely that if it were decided on, it could be in operation before January 1966.  Once this scheme was decided upon the installation of septic tanks would become compulsory, without exception throughout Burra, unless connected to the sewerage drain.  Depending on demand the Council is likely to term this phase 1, with other areas perhaps eventually added to the service.  The Central Board of health would handle the survey, designs, plans and estimates of cost, at no charge to Burra.

Fire.  A grass fire at Hallett consumed about 70 acres and several outbuildings adjacent to the railway line just south of the Hallett Station, on the western side of the station yards, on Tuesday morning last.

The Housing Trust of SA has accepted the offer of the Burra Town Council and will purchase land near the PMG line shop.  An early start on building in that area is likely.

The Swimming Carnival planned for 21 February has attracted 55 swimmers from Broken Hill.  Others will come from Gawler.

Burra Racing Club has been allotted Wednesday 15 September and Saturday 23 October for race meetings in 1965.

Accident/Obituary.  An accident about one mile north of Saddleworth on Sunday morning [7 February] resulted in one man’s death and serious injuries to another.  The accident was almost opposite the Catholic Church at about 2.45 a.m.  The driver, aged 35, was dead when found at about 7 a.m. and another man aged 24 was unconscious with severe head and other injuries.  The deceased, from Peterborough, was Gordon Desmond Lacey and injured was Neil Millard, also of Peterborough.

Arthur Jordan.  An article from the Gawler Bunyip of about 12 months earlier is reprinted.

Arthur D. Jordan of Gawler is 90 today.  One of his most vivid recollections is likely to be the day, 78 years ago, that he climbed the Smelters’ Chimney at Burra.  The young ‘Art’ Jordan shinned up the 85 ft stack with townspeople looking on.  Since then he has become a citizen of Gawler and a Life Member of the Gawler Jockey Club.  He managed A. Sheard’s Essex House in Gawler for 25 years and had his own drapery business for 27 years in the store occupied by Gordon Ames.  He was Secretary of the Gawler Chess Club during its active years.  He was born in Clare.  [Born at Kooringa: see below.]

[A couple of verses of the poem When Arthur Climbed the Chimney are printed.]

[See Burra Record 57, 45, 10 Nov. 1936, page 3: Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward.  Arthur Jordan was the son of the late J.D. Jordan, watchmaker, of Kooringa.  Arthur Dawson Jordan born 8 March 1873 Kooringa: died 28 October 1965, Gawler.]

Fire.  On Sunday afternoon a bushfire began south of Clare and burned on area of some 50 to 60 square miles, devastating country between Clare, Mintaro, Farrell Flat and Hill River. A number of homes were destroyed along with many outbuildings and haystacks, sheep, cattle and miles of fencing.  The fire was brought under control in the early hours of Monday morning.  Patrols are still watching hot spots for potential outbreaks.

Weather.  A freak windstorm on Sunday afternoon caused the collapse of a large implement shed on Mr Gordon Webster’s property at Springbank.  In the process a utility was blown across the yard into the house fence, which was flattened by the impact.

Swimming.  The Open Swimming Carnival at Burra on Sunday was not well attended due to the extreme heat.  Some also left when new of the fire between Clare and Farrell Flat was received.  The carnival itself went relatively well.  For Burra Garry Hirschausen, Sandra Williams and Jill Eberhard gained trophies.

Mt Bryan Methodist Church held its harvest festival on Sunday 28 February.  A dedication service was held when Mr Horrie Edwards and family presented a lectern and Bible to the church in memory of their late husband and father.  Mr Edwards had been a local preacher in the circuit for over 40 years.  He was a member of the Order of Knights and Sunday school Superintendent for many years at the old church.  Mr George Goodridge and Mrs Crew presented to the church an engraved music stand in memory of Mrs Goodridge who started teaching in the Sunday school of the old church when she was 17 and continued till she moved to Ironmine in 1906.  She then taught there for five years.  She married in 1911 and again took a Sunday school class and with her brother Horrie worked in the Sunday school till the church closed in 1939.  Both Mr Edwards and Mrs Goodridge also worked in the Town Church and Sunday school for many years.

Fire.  The large fire on Sunday 21 February gave Farrell Flat an uneasy time.  Strong southwest winds and a temperature in excess of 100°F blew the flames from Mintaro towards Farrell Flat.  Several times men fighting the fire were in danger of being trapped in pockets of fire.  Units managed to check the fire three miles south of the town and a wind change swept it northeast* until it was checked at the stone wall on the Clare-Farrell Flat Road.  There were heavy losses of sheep, fodder and fencing.

[* The description suggests it was swept northwest rather than northeast.]

The headmaster Mr Ian Auhl asked that the objectives for 1965 should include reference books for the new library.

A subsidy was available for preparing the lunch room for use as an art room as well as the addition of heaters to another room, the renovating of school drums and the grassing of the oval.  Elected were: President, Mrs J.R. Carpenter; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames R. Thamm & D. Bannister; Secretary, Mrs J. Taylor; Assistant Secretary, Mrs D. Broderick and Treasurer, Mrs Benger.  The retiring President Mrs Edith Carpenter reported that they had 54 financial members and an average attendance of 24 for 1964.

Burra Primary School Committee: Annual Report.  Chairman K.W. White.

Mr D. Zanker was elected Chairman in 1964 and served very actively until his transfer from the district.  Headmaster Mr Horsnell was transferred at the end of Term 1, to be succeeded by Mr I. Auhl.  Both headmasters have given strong support to the committee.  A picture evening with Gilbert Valley Camera Club in April raised £10-17-6.  Arbor Day was successfully held in July.  School Sports were keenly contested at the War Memorial Oval.  The Committee helped in completing the new cricket pitch and in getting power lines removed where they crossed the new area and water has now been laid on.  Entrance gates in the oval fence were fitted to allow direct access.  The proposed resurfacing of the tennis courts and provision of backstops is in abeyance.  The approach to the school has been made safer with the co-operation of the Town Council.

Burra Small Bore Club fired a match over double 75 yards at which the best scorers were D. Griffiths, M. Thomas and R. Angel.

Burra Burra Show Inc.

Report of President Mr Rex Warnes

The last show was on 12 October 1964.  Conditions were shocking.  It poured with rain from morning to late afternoon, marring what deserved to be a record day.  Gate takings were down £30.  The Governor Sir Edric Bastyan and Lady Bastyan attended and his Excellency opened the show in heavy rain, making light of the circumstances.  After lunch he toured the soggy grounds and inspected the exhibits.  The Police Force Band attended, but rain prevented them from playing after lunch and they left.  Exhibits were of a high standard and numbered 2629.  Membership has fallen by 30 and this needs to be rectified.  Generous donated [from people who were listed] have helped to reduce the society’s overdraft.  Young’s Caterers of Melrose did an efficient job.  During the year death removed some staunch supporters in the persons of Mr W.H. Lloyd (a Past President), Mr C.T. Beckwith and Mr M.A. Radford.  Mr Lloyd and Mr Beckwith were both Honorary Life Members.

[The usual thanks to stewards and committees follows.]

Elected were: Patron, G. Stanley Hawker; President, M.G. Stockman and Vice-Presidents, Rex C. Warnes & B.A. Riggs.  The next show will be held on 9 October 1965.

Headmaster R.M. Farrow handed over a cheque for almost £100 representing the initial instalment of the Voluntary Contributions for the year.

The President reported a membership of 61 and an average attendance of 37.  The project for the year was the erection of a dressing shed for girls, but later we learnt the Department might supply this, so it was decided instead to spend £100 on Physical Education equipment and £100 on the library.  Income from the school sports afternoon tea was used to offset bus expenses for the Inter-High School Sports trip to Riverton in May.  The High School Ball at the end of Term 2 was a social and financial success and just over £100 was made.  The Christmas Banquet was a very enjoyable occasion when approximately 200 were catered for.  Approximately 120 parents attended an informative talk by Mr Farrow in February – on the coming year’s work.

Burra Town Council Elections

E.T. Baulderstone was re-elected for the twelfth consecutive year in Council.  This also means he has been 20 consecutive years in Council.  He first took his seat for East Ward in July 1946 and became Mayor in July 1954.

Decimal Currency

With the Commonwealth Mint busy making the decimal coinage, they cannot manufacture more pennies and half-pennies.  These are in short supply, it is believed because people think they will be able to make a profit on them after decimal currency comes in.  This is not so; half-pennies, pennies and threepences will only be exchanged in multiples of sixpence, which have exact equivalents to multiples of five cents.

Burra Stockowners’ Association met at the RSL Hall on Thursday to discuss the proposed reserved price for wool scheme and the narrowing of existing stock routes.  Elected: President, H.C. Radford and Vice-President, Don Lord.  On the question of stock routes the meeting decided to recommend to the Burra Burra DC:

King or Florieton S.R. be reduced to 3 chains for its entire length.

The Eastern S.R. be reduced to 10 chains as far as Baldina Creek and from the west to 3 chains.

The Baldina-Robertstown S.R. be reduced to 3 chains.

Redbanks Reserve be declared a dedicated reserve under the Burra Burra DC.

State President J.W. Andre, P.A. McBride of the Australian Wool Board and R.J. McCauley, Treasurer of the Association gave interesting addresses on the reserve price scheme, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages.

The Government has agreed in principle if the woolgrowers agree at a referendum.  The Wool Industry Conference has recommended the woolgrowers would contribute £20 million over 8 years.  The agreement is now for £30 million over 7 years.  The money would come from a levy not exceeding 3% of the gross proceeds of wool sold.

This money would cover:

Their contribution to the scheme’s capital.

Commitments for the promotion of wool.

Commitments for wool research.

Papal Honour for Burra’s Parish Priest

The Most Rev. B.

Monsignor Hughes was born in Victoria and educated at Christian Brothers in Geelong.  He studied for the priesthood in Europe: in Ireland and Rome. He was ordained at St John Lateran Basilica in Rome in 1926.  He is also an Arts graduate of Melbourne University.  He has worked in the northern part of SA, notably at Port Augusta, Port Pirie, Peterborough, Carrieton and Renmark.  He has been at Burra for 15 years.

Accident.  On Thursday a 10-year-old cyclist travelling north on the Mt Bryan Road got something caught in his wheel, causing him to swerve suddenly into the path of an oncoming semi-trailer loaded with 30 head of cattle.  The semi-trailer driver was quick to react and swerved off the road, colliding with a telegraph pole.  The boy ran into the rear of the trailer and suffered bruising and slight concussion.  Sgt Teague and Constable K. Terry of Burra attended the scene and praised the driver for his effort, which had averted a more serious result.  PMG linesmen soon repaired the damaged lines.

Burra Town Council.  The Mayor’s Report 1964-65

The Council budgeted for a debit of £1,700 for the year and finished at approximately that amount.  Over the past three years the Council has expended over £3,000 on new plant and is now reaping the benefit.  The main improvement this year has been the erection of a new toilet block opposite the Town Hall.  The Council has agreed to clean up the creek area and develop a park which together with the swimming pool and proposed Caravan Park will create a real beauty spot for the town.

The Memorial Oval Committee has been financed to the extent of £500 to help with water reticulation.  The cemetery is nor a credit to the town and if looked after should not get into the condition it previously was in.  Thank go to the DC for grading etc. at the cemetery.

The old jinker has been housed in the main street.  Some ratepayers may think this a waste of money, but it is possibly the only one of its kind in Australia and a relic of early days in Australia.  It fits in well with the developing park and the National Trust building in the vicinity.

A spraying program has been effective in managing water tables.  Progress on eliminating horehound has been made, but it is slow.

The Council passed a vote of gratitude for the outstanding work in public affairs and town progress by the Mayor and Mayoress.

Burra Catholic Ball on Friday night at Burra Town Hall drew a good crowd.  Proceeds were about £100.

Accident.  Miss D.A. Ezra of Broken Hill lost control of a VW sedan on the bend at Burra Racecourse on Friday at 10.45 p.m.  The car rolled over.  Of the four occupants two suffered bruising only and one was treated at the Burra Hospital for a lacerated forehead.  The front passenger was the only one wearing a seat belt and the only one uninjured.

Mr Roy Sellars of Burra North has completed 60 years as a shearing shed worker.  He first began work in 1905 on Mt Bryan Station of Mr Charles Bowman.  Over the years the property has been split up, but in the past week Mr Sellars has been working in the same shed – presently owned by A.B. & B.A. Riggs on their ‘Kabymur’ property.  It is thought the property is almost 100 years old.  Roy is at present pressing bales for Messrs Riggs exactly 60 years after he first slept there and over the years has pressed bales in most woolsheds east of Burra and in many parts of the State.  The ink from branding the bales gave him the nick name ‘Inky’ and many who would not know Roy Sellars know ‘Inky’ Sellars.  It would be interesting to know how many bales he has pressed in 60 years.

The Burra Fire Brigade

The chief officer of the SA Fire Brigades Board has had discussions with the Mayor Mr Baulderstone, the Councillors and the Town Clerk re the town brigade.  It was decided some facts needed to be publicised.

The Burra Fire Brigade is part of the Auxiliary Fire Service maintained by the Board to afford fire protection to certain country centres where the Fire Brigades Act Applies.

It is manned by an Auxiliary Foreman and Auxiliary Fireman, who have permanent employment in the town and who are available to answer fire calls on a 24 hour basis.

Auxiliary Firemen needed to be fit and undergo a medical examination when they join.  They are provided with uniforms and equipment and must attend drills and instruction as required.

They are expected to devote a reasonable proportion of their time to the Brigade and take their turn of duty at the station as required.

They receive an annual retainer payable monthly plus 15/- per hour or part thereof when at fires or cleaning up afterwards.  The Foreman gets £130 p.a., the Firemen £100 and the Standby £25.

The retainer is payable for the first three months of sickness.

Auxiliary Firemen are covered by Workmen’s Compensation for death or accident while on duty.

Absence due to holidays from his permanent job does not interfere with his retainer.

The Education Department has just made available a room and furnishings for a library for the Primary School in addition to the High School Library.  Approximately £1,000 is needed to adequately stock the two libraries – to be made up of 75% reference and 25% fiction.  Donations would be subsidised pound for pound.

Burra High School Ball had an attendance reduced by influenza that has been serious in the past week or two.  Still, the door takings were over £100 and the event was both enjoyable and worthwhile.

Weather.  Further falls of 60-80 points were widely reported in the past week from the agricultural areas.

Booborowie Pictures will cease from 6 November.  For the past three years they have been conducted by the Institute Committee, who have been selling and collecting tickets.  Fred Dinham, Brian Billing and Alan Dewhirst have been honorary operators.  In this time about £100 had been raised for the hall, but now lack of support and falling attendances have made it a losing proposition.

Accident/Obituary.  Last Tuesday at about 5.30 p.m. Virginia May Quinn aged 4 and Adrian Peter Quinn aged 2, children of Mr & Mrs J.V. Quinn of Mt Bryan were drowned in a dam on the property.  They had been playing on a pony near the woolshed and on being missed a search found them floating in the dam.  Artificial respiration was ineffective.

Burra & District Swimming Pool

Only seven persons attended a public meeting to discuss the future management of the pool and this included the Mayor and two Councillors.  The others were two members of the Swimming Club and one newcomer to the town.  Discussion disclosed the view that the control of the pool by the Burra & District Swimming Club resulted in the needs of the competitive swimmer being placed before the needs of the public and casual swimmers.  A resolution was passed that a recommendation be made at the Swimming Club’s AGM that the management and control of the pool be vested with the Corporation and the Club concentrate on running competitive swimming.

Burra Show was held on Saturday in fine weather and drew a record number of entries and a record gate taking of £258.  Mr Res Warnes, as President of the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, opened the show.  The day dawned with misty rain, but soon cleared to a fine day.  The Flower Pavilion looked a picture. The display of school work was excellent.  Grain and fodder, fruit and vegetables, cooking, needlework and Youth Club displays combined well.  The strong support of exhibitors from the Clare District was evident throughout.  There was a good variety of sideshows.  Samson the Strongman proved the most popular of the tent shows.  Young’s Caterers of Melrose again did a good job.  Local and visiting businesses provided a variety of machinery merchandise and vehicles.  Quite a good crowd attended the dance in the main pavilion at night, when door takings amounted to £50.  The Cascades Band provided the music for this event arranged by the Rural Youth Club.

Burra Mine

The Burra Mine was inspected on Friday by Mr S. Bevan the minister of Mines, Mr T.A. Barnes the Director of Mines, the Deputy Director Mr Parkin and the Senior Geologist Mr Nixon.  The Minister said the Mines Department had been carrying out extensive geological, Geophysical and Geochemical surveys of the district for several years, coupled with a drilling program.  This had established substantial ‘leavings’ of oxidised copper in and north of the old open cut.  It is estimated to comprise over one million tons of low grade oxidised copper.  Trial recovery from parcels of the material by Australian Mineral Development Laboratories had been encouraging.  The interest of major exploration companies was being invited and if further work confirms the Mine Department’s findings an industry would be established at Burra to recover the copper.  This would involve open cut mining and the removal of overburden and oxidised copper to at least 100 ft below the present water level in the old open cut, followed by acid leaching of the ore to recover copper concentrate in a treatment plant.  Employment for over 50 men would last from 5 to 10 years.  Also several targets for deeper drilling had been suggested and any company selected for the project would be required to continue vigorous and substantial exploration, which if successful could lead to a major mining operation.  Mr Baulderstone and Mr Finch were very interested in the tour of inspection and appreciated the action of the Minister in including them and the Town & District Councils in the inspection.

Mr W. (Bill) Voumard is 90 today and still going strong on his bicycle.

The Burra Schools’ Libraries’ Appeal has reached £1008, with donations still coming in.

Accident.  A car driven by Mrs R.J. Jeffery of Burra was struck by the Adelaide bound morning passenger steam train at the Manoora crossing on Saturday morning.  The car was picked up and rammed into the culvert and bank.  Mrs Jeffery was not seriously hurt, but her passenger, Mrs H.J. Topsfield, is still in a serious condition in the Royal Adelaide Hospital after being transferred from the Riverton Hospital.

Elders-GM Annual Stud Ewe Sale was held on Wednesday 13 October and drew a small, but very interested group of local and interstate buyers.  There was keen support from WA buyers. The highest price went to John Collins & Sons for eight specially selected strong woolled 1½-year-old May-born ewes, which sold to 52 guineas and went to W.J. & J. Wade of Narrogin WA.  [Prices are printed, with other details and the promise of more in the following issue.]

St Mary’s Organ Recital

On Sunday 14 November a concert celebrated the anniversary of the installation of the pipe organ.  Dr J.V. Peters, University of Adelaide Organist and Senior Lecturer of the Elder Conservatorium of Music, played the organ.  Over 150 people attended.  Scripture readings and prayers accompanied the music.   Music included three pieces by Samuel Wesley, a voluntary by William Walond and Henry Purcell’s Trumpet Tune & Air.  The Rector, Rev. G.D. Sibly, gave an address on the history of pipe organs and traced the origins of the St Mary’s instrument.  It was decided on 20 January 1901, after much discussion, to purchase a pipe organ costing not more than £350.  The instrument was dedicated and opened by the rector, Rev. Wightwick, on 22 October 1901.  Dr Harold Davies of the Elder Conservatorium played at the dedication.  The organ has 588 pipes ranging from 16 ft to 2 inches.  The second part of Dr Peter’s recital comprised music pf J.S. Bach: three chorale preludes and the Prelude and Fugue in G. major.

Burra School Libraries

Following the success of the appeal for library funds, strong representations had to be made to the Education department to have the promise of subsidies honoured in full.  Upon realising that the general public was involved, the Education Department agreed to honour the promise and books are being purchased to the full value of £2,000.  The Department has also agreed to proceed with the necessary alterations to the library rooms as soon as possible.  The Appeal Committee is not satisfied that, after some delay and discussion, the Department is fully supporting and granting all requests made.  A large proportion of the indexing and cataloguing of library books has been completed and hours have been spent covering books.  The final cost of the libraries will be in the region of £7,000.  The sum raised in the appeal for book funds was £1,100.

Burra High School.  A group of 44 First & Second Year students had a recreation weekend camp at Parnanga National Fitness Council Camp at O’Sullivan’s Beach near Adelaide.

The 1965-66 Harvest has been delayed by rain and though the Burra silos took their first delivery on 24 November, only about 20,000 bushels have since come in.    This is about one day’s taking in a normal year.  The quality of the grain is good, but the quantity will be down.  Mr Graham Heinrich for example at Worlds’ End reaped an 8-9 bag crop, but this year only a 3 bag crop.  The late rains evidently did more good than was expected and many farmers are reporting better results than they had feared.

The Burra Swimming Pool.  Letter from E.T. Baulderstone.

He explains that for the last few years the pool has been administered by the Burra & District Amateur Swimming Club, which has had a lot of difficulties in doing so.  At the recent AGM it was decided to ask the Corporation to take over the administration.  The Council saw the possibility of the pool not functioning and realised its importance in teaching young people to swim and in the relaxation and enjoyment it offered citizens.  The Corporation also considered the amount of effort and capital invested and so decided to accede to the request and to take over the administration.  The Council advertised for an attendant, but so far without success.  Finally the late Mr D. Morrison agreed to help, but unfortunately he fell ill and was confined to hospital.  Mr & Mrs W. Holness have opened the pool at weekends and some afternoons, but due to a lot of undue criticism do not feel inclined to continue.

[Mr Baulderstone says he does not blame them.]

The pool is in excellent condition, but will have to stay closed until we can get an attendant or attendants.  In conclusion he thanks, on behalf of the young people in particular who have enjoyed their swimming in the last two weeks, to thank Mr & Mrs Holness for their kind gesture.

Burra hospital renovations were approved and the usual building fees were waived.

88, 49 (2), 14 Dec. 1965, page 1 [Number previously used in 1958.]

Burra Swimming Pool is still without an attendant following the illness and subsequent death of Mr D. Morrison, who had been appointed caretaker on a five day basis with someone else to open it at weekends.  Mr G. Baulderstone opened it on Saturday and Sunday.  A public meeting is called for 2.30 p.m.  tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss the possibility of a roster system.  The attendant opens the pool and handles the sale of drinks etc.  A standard of discipline must also be enforced.  Without an attendant the pool will have to remain closed.

Billy McMahon	Kathryn Quinn	Kathleen Benton

Lynette Broad	Colleen Crowhurst

Burra Swimming Pool.  About 20 people attended the public meeting called by the Mayor to discuss a roster system to allow the pool to open daily.  Arrangements to use about 30 people were made, enabling the pool to open daily, including weekends. The Education Department’s learn to swim campaign will be run 3-14 January.

Mr R. Fuss of Burra North has constructed and presented to the town a full scale working model of gear used by tributors who worked at the mine after it closed.  They are being set up at the end of the jinker shed and comprise a Cousin Jack wheelbarrow, a windlass, an ore dressing table with a peculiar shaped hammer and an ore washing plant.

Adelaide Wool Sales 24-26 November.  The top price for the district of 77¼d was achieved by J.N. McBride of Kia-Ora.  [Other local district prices are printed.]

The Carols Evening in the Town Hall on Sunday Night was not overwhelmingly supported, but was thoroughly enjoyed by those who attended.  Mr Arthur Verco of 5AD was the compere.  The sale of programs and donations amounted to £40.

88, 50 (2), 21 Dec. 1965, pages 1, 4 & 5 [Number previously used in 1958.]

Burra High School Speech Night was held in the Burra Town Hall on 14 December.  S.L. Tregenza, retired Principal of Brighton High School was the guest speaker.  The Hon. Member for Burra, P.H. Quirke, also attended.  Mrs Tregenza presented the prizes and Mr Quirke presented certificates and trophies to the boys and Mrs Quirke did the same to the girls.  Mr Darrell Field as Chairman of the High School Council was in the chair.

The headmaster Mr R.M. Farrow reported on the year:

We have recently seen the election in Mr Field of only the fourth Chairman of the High School Council.  This is a fine record of service for chairmen over such a long period.  Both Mr A.B. Riggs and Mr H.J.B. Jennison, past chairmen, are present and the latter only retired after 18 years of service and 12 as chairman.  Their wives also served long periods as members of the Council as well as on the Parents & Friends’ Association.

[Mr Farrow also welcomed the Mayor & Mayoress, Mr Finch Chairman of the DC and Mr Auhl, Headmaster of the Primary School and Mrs Auhl, as well as the religious instructors.]

Last year’s public examinations resulted in the awarding of 24 Intermediate Certificates and the completion of two others.  Four Leaving Certificates were gained and one was completed.  Three others were gained in the Supplementary Examinations.  Lynette Robinson and Denise Griffen won Intermediate Exhibitions and Eleanor Miller and Gregory Short gained Continuation Scholarships.

This year the club period has continued and sport has continued to play its vital role with inter-house matches and inter-school exchanges against Balaklava and Clare High Schools, while matches against Riverton will be played tomorrow. In the Inter-High School Sports Day Burra won the E.E. Williams Handicap Shield for the second successive year and only narrowly missed the Championship Shield.

The swimming carnival in March was an outstanding success.

In September 36 Intermediate and Leaving students accompanied by Miss Jones, Miss Briggs, Mr Morris and myself undertook a ten day tour to Sydney and Canberra – a very exciting and worthwhile trip and recently a party of 44 First and Second Year students had a recreational weekend at the Parnanga National Fitness Council Camp at O’Sullivan’s Beach, at which Mrs Jones, Mr Ayliffe, Mr Schwartz and Mr Hayward were energetic leaders.

The parent bodies have been very helpful and valuable.  Traditions such as the annual ball and the banquet always receive 100% support.  The banquet is to be held this coming Thursday.

Money has been set aside for the erection of changing rooms and the installation of fans in the iron rooms.  Subsidy will be granted when funds become available.  The Association has also provided additional furnishings for the sick room and crockery and an electric urn for what is still only a temporary staff room.

The High School Council in conjunction with the Primary School Committee has done excellent work and this has made successful representations to the Education Department to purchase land in front of the school.  The Council also supported my moves to have pathways in front of the school repaired.

Other moves, which I anticipate will come to fruition soon, are for the remodelling of the toilets and headmaster’s office, paving of the yard and the provision of proper staff facilities.  The school still lacks many of the desirable features that modern education needs for effectiveness.

One innovation this year was an open night when teachers were available for interview by parents who were also invited to visit classrooms as they saw fit.

For a long time the High school has followed the traditional academic courses leading to Intermediate and Leaving Public Examinations.  I am pleased, if a little apprehensive that next year we are to have an alternative course leading to an internal Intermediate Certificate.  This should cater for a large percentage of students, while still giving the enlightenment which we claim an education should do.

In spite of all the promise here; I still fear the problem of the closed mind.  There is an absence in the district at large and in the school itself of an academic climate.  There is little point in the school trying to open up the mind of the child unless firstly he is encouraged and inspired by at least some other lively minds and worthwhile intellectual pursuits outside of school and unless there is some opportunity to continue his intellectual growth once he has left school.

[Mr Farrow then developed this theme at some length.  He went on to speak of the donors of prizes and trophies and to thank those who organised the hall.  He spoke also of the House system and wished departing students well.]

Staff changes: Mr Ayliffe has transferred to Norwood High School and Miss E.J. Newman of Findon High School has been appointed Senior Mistress at Burra.

Burra Burra DC

Among other transfer notices is one from M.L. Rasmus & another to Ian Joseph Denton and Trevor Bruce Denton of Lot 13 of 13perches and Lot 14 of 1 rood 8 perches and Section 417 Torreston.

Characteristics of the paper in 1965

A fair coverage for Burra, but a lot on outlying areas like Hallett, Spalding and Farrell Flat.

Page 1

Dominated by news, but this is by no means confined to Burra news.

Pages 2 & 3

Large advertisements and public notices and sales and these often extend to page 3.  There may be some news also on page 3.

Pages 4, 5 & 6

Half at least is advertising.  As far as news is concerned these pages are dominated by sports results.  Other prominent features are reports of Annual General Meetings of clubs and other organisations such as church organisations and the CWA along with some reports of their meetings.

Page 7

The ‘Cash Column’ is often here, though it sometimes appears elsewhere and shares space with other items typical of pages 4, 5 & 6.

Page 8

Advertising and a large section of 50 and 25 years ago in the paper, along with news from other districts.  The reports from past years can also wander onto other pages.

Pages 9 & 10

These extra pages sometimes appear and continue the style of pages 4, 5 & 6.

Supplements are not uncommon, but vary in size and are sometimes single-sided.

NOTE THAT WHEN 1959 IS NOTED IT SHOULD BE FOUND TO BE VOLUME 89

IF THIS IS SO THE ISSUE NUMBERS FOR 1966 WILL ALL BE (2)

89, 1, 11 January 1966 page 1

Burra CWA building is now free of debt.  Treasurer Mrs H. Crump made the last payment to the Savings Bank after the last meeting.  It is hoped a new fence will soon be erected between the CWA property and those of the M&BHA and Mr & Mrs P. Byles.

A minute of appreciation was recorded for the effort of Mrs Phillips in hiring out crockery over recent years.   This has raised almost £80, but will now be discontinued due to the time and effort required.  Following the Christmas meeting the branch has gone into recess until 17 March.

The rainfall for 1965 was 1159 points: about six inches below average.

Swimming.  The first round of the annual triangular inter-club swim between Burra, Clare and Spalding has resulted in Burra and Clare being equal on points with 42 each and Spalding has 38.  [Results are printed.]

Elders-GM.  After a stay of 6½ years the Chief Clerk at Burra Mr R.N. Jenkins has been transferred to Bordertown.  While in Burra ‘Jenks’ has been associated with the football, tennis and table tennis.  He was also for a time secretary of the Swimming Club and a member of the Rural Youth Club.  He is replaced by Mr G.J. Timmins of Strathalbyn.

From Alice Springs, after a stay of several years, Mr Ray Kotz transfers to Gawler later this month.

The Learn to Swim Campaign has about 160 children taking part at Burra.  This is about 30 fewer than in 1965, but on a par with 1964.

Jack Kellaway (82) of Croydon has renewed his subscription to the paper and says most of his family worked in the old Burra Mine at some time or other.  His grandfather, William Kellaway, came out from Cornwall about 106 years ago and worked in the mine.

BHS.  Intermediate craft subject results are printed.

New staff:

Mr D. Pennington replaces Mr Ayliffe.  He will live at Hallett and drive the school bus in each day.

Miss E.J. Newman has been appointed Acting Senior Mistress.

New Year’s Eve prank.  Someone plastered shop windows and doors etc. with white paint as a joke.  Some of it has proved very difficult to remove and was hardly funny.

Burra Silos have received an intake closer to normal than had been expected, with about 175,000 bushels up to yesterday.  This compares with 190,000 bushels taken to the same time in the 1964-65 season.  The quality has been good.

Fires.  The Farrell Flat area has had two fires recently.

On 30 December 20-30 acres of grass and some fencing was burnt when fire broke out just north of the town.

On 7 and 8 January there were fires near Lodge Hill.

Accident/Obituaries.

Over the New Year weekend five young people were killed in a light plane crash at Canopus Station east of Burra.  The pilot was Russell Tiver (23) the son of Mr & Mrs M.H. Tiver of Burra.  He had been conducting sight-seeing tours over the 400,000 acre property, owned by Mr W.G. Snell, when the accident occurred.  The passengers were:

David Stanley Radford (15) and William John Radford (12) who were the only children of David Radford of Canegrass Station.  And also Janne Elizabeth Daniel (16) and Peter John Daniel (13) who were the only children of Mr & Mrs S.D. Daniel of Kulpara.

A private funeral was conducted at Burra Cemetery for Mr Tiver and for the others private services were held in Adelaide.

[Russell Gordon Tiver born 8 July 1942 Abberton Park, Burra: died 1 January 1966 Canopus Station.]

Burra Town Council

Following the resignation of the Town Clerk Mr W.A. Holness after four years, the Council last night appointed Mr A.R. Graham in his place.  Mr Graham has previously been Town Clerk at Jamestown.  He is married with two young children.

Farrell Flat Silo has closed after receiving 426,560 bushels of wheat.

Jill Przibilla will begin as an assistant at Clare Pre-School Kindergarten in February.

Burra Caravan Park

In the new caravan park near the swimming pool the walls of the amenities block have been completed.  It is hoped the new park will be ready by the end of March.

A New Road Law, effective from 1 January has made it an offence to drive with any portion of the body projecting from the vehicle – so watch out for elbows and gutter clutching.

Accident.  A car carrying Mrs S. Kirk and her young son and daughter overturned near Snowtown on Sunday evening.  The three escaped injury.

89, 3, 25 January 1966 page 3

Burra Mine

Exploration rights for the Burra Mine have been let.  Drilling will start within a few days. The Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan announced this today.  The rights have been granted to Mines Exploration Pty Ltd on behalf of Broken Hill South Ltd, North Broken Hill Ltd, Electrolitic Zinc Co. of Australia Ltd and McPhar Geophysics Ltd.  Exploration work by the Department of Mines has shown that redevelopment of low grade oxidised ore in the old mine was a sound economic proposal and that further exploration for primary ore near the old workings was worth while.  Mines Exploration Pty Ltd represented a predominantly Australian group.  The company would expend a large sum in further testing of the low grade oxidised ore and also the deep ore deposits.  A decision on whether it would be economic to establish a mining treatment project for oxidised ore can be expected within twelve months.

Burra Town Council, 20 December

A man from the SA Archives will be allowed to inspect old Council records.

Elders-GM are to be advised that the Council is interested in the purchase of Pt Section 13 for use as a public reserve for the town.

The Town Clerk’s resignation was accepted and applications for a replacement will close on 14 January.

Burra Choral Society has vacancies for singers in all departments.  It has its first meeting for 1966 on 17 February. The conductor is Rev. G.D. Sibly, Secretary Mrs Edith Carpenter and Mrs J. Oates is the pianist.

The Burra Oval grassing project is progressing well, though there are still some bare patches.  The growing season has been particularly dry, which has hindered the efforts of Mr Baulderstone and Mr Arnold Heinrich.

Nigel Dollman (4), son of Mr & Mrs Guy Dollman, vanished from the Burra Street when his mother popped into Wilkinson’s for a moment.  A family and then a police search proved fruitless, but at 2 p.m. the police were advised that he was at Yunta, having boarded a tourist coach at Burra.

Swimming.  In the triangular contest between Burra, Clare and Spalding, Burra and Clare tied in the first meet, but Spalding established a lead of almost 80 points at the second meet and consequently it is unlikely Spalding can be overtaken in the third contest at Clare on Friday.  Spalding will therefore hold the shield for the next twelve months.

Mr A.R. Graham the new Burra Town Clerk will take up his duties on 14 March.

Obituary.  Mr Willie (Bill) Voumard died on Thursday night aged 90.  [There was also a death notice on page 2.]

He was born in Berne, Switzerland, 19 October 1875 and came to Australia aged 6.*  The family came to live at Copperhouse and moved into Burra when he was aged 9.  He died in the house that had been his home for 81 years.  In early life he worked on a number of eastern pastoral properties.  He was an enthusiastic cyclist and on many occasions would ride 50 or 60 miles from his place of employment to a sports meeting and then compete in events.  He won a number of medals and trophies and on one such occasion won a 50 mile race in a little over two hours.  He continued to ride his bike in Burra up to the time of his death.  In 1906 he married Florence Minetta Brandt and they had eight children before she died in 1924.  He then left the ‘Eastern’ Country and came to work in Burra for the Burra Town Council until retiring some years ago.  In 1927 he married Clara Ellen McLennan who died in 1957.  He is survived by Fred, Ruby (Mrs Jack Rowe), Jack, Lance, Jean (Mrs Murray Opperman), May (Mrs Joff Parkes), Ida (Mrs Norman Hyde) and Edna (Mrs Jack O’Keefe).

Burra Branch of the National Trust of SA: Letter to the Editor

Burra is a unique town and this is often more apparent to visitors than to the locals.  Its history lies not so much in written records as in its buildings and walls, its Cornish cottages and its place names.  [A discussion of some of these places then follows.]

The National Trust Branch was formed because a number of people felt that the preservation of Burra’s fascinating past could not much longer be left merely to chance, especially with the possibility of renewed mining and the expansion which could result.  Items of historical interest are scattered in homes and sheds and are hidden in places where they could be forgotten.  The Trust aims to collect such items and to house them in a proper building where they can be preserved and made available to all our people, visitors and tourists and to our children as a record that can be seen and touched.  Other towns in SA with a much smaller role in the history of the state have begun to preserve their past and we are sure the people of Burra and District will also want to preserve their own history.

If there is a symbol of Burra it surely is Johnny Green.

Your donation can help our efforts to do this, whether with money or historical items.  The aim is to raise $1,600 to set up the museum.

Burra Primary School Welfare Club 1965 Report.

There were 55 financial members and an average attendance of over 30.

The year’s opening balance was £114-7-9 and is now £150-15-0.

During the year we purchased sports equipment, library books, towel racks, clocks, equipment for the oval, art materials and teachers’ aids.  The school did not go to the Inter-School Sports at Hallett this year, but held its own sports day where more students could participate.  On that occasion the Welfare Club raised £57-11-9 at a trading table, a raffle and an afternoon tea.  The main drive this year was held in conjunction with BHS School Committee, the High School Council and the Parents & Friends to reach the target of £1,000 for a reference library.  In that effort we were successful.  At present the room to house the library is being prepared.  Fans will be installed in the prefabricated rooms as soon as possible.

Kooringa in 1866 from the SA Gazetteer of 1867.

Kooringa is a postal township on the Burra Creek about 50 miles from Kapunda and has daily communication with Adelaide by mail coach to Kapunda and thence by rail to Adelaide.  It is situated on very irregular ground, broken by fissures and watercourses.  The situation and creek divide the township, which is scattered over a considerable area.  There is no corporation or district council, though efforts are being made to obtain the former.  It has an Institute, post office, money order office and telegraph station.  It is surrounded by a chain of undulating hills in many parts of which copper is found along with promising specimens of silver and lead ore – this in addition to the Burra Burra Mine.

While there are no rivers near Kooringa there are the Burra, Baldina and Gum Creeks – but in summer only waterholes can be relied upon.  Kooringa has no mills, but there is a brewery and candle manufacturer.  It is principally a mining and pastoral centre with a few sections under wheat cultivation.

On addition to the Burra Burra Mine there are the All Nations Mine, Flinders Mine, Scrubbers Camp Mine, Kingston Mine and Karkulto Mine.  The two former are worked by a Melbourne Company who are sanguine of success.  Scrubbers Mine is about 28 miles north and a main lode is expected to be struck soon.  Kingston Mine is a further 7 miles northeast.  Karkulto Mine is owned by the SA Mining Association and is 15 miles southeast of Kooringa.  It principally produces iron ore used in smelting copper.  The nearest places are:

Redruth, 1 mile northwest

Hampton, 1½ miles northeast

Copperhouse, 2 miles west

Sod Hut, 8 miles along the Adelaide Road.

The nearest townships are Mintaro and Clare, with which there is communication by Rounsevell’s Coach.  Though Kooringa has no benevolent asylum, a benevolent association has been active for the relief of the poor.  There is a hospital built by the SA Mining Association expressly for the accommodation of their miners, but accessible to the poorer classes on obtaining the permission of the mining authorities.

Hotels in Kooringa are the Burra, Miners’ Arms and the Pig and Whistle.

There is a National Bank branch, a public pound and a Masonic Lodge, Oddfellows’ Lodge and a Foresters Court.  The population of Kooringa, Redruth, Aberdeen and Hampton is about 3,100 with about 460 houses, but of these about 120 are uninhabited.  A corporation would remedy many of the evils.  The approaches to the cemetery are extremely bad and even dangerous.  In crossing creeks and water courses the remains of the dead have more than once been precipitated to the ground.  The present road between Kooringa and Redruth is extremely bad.  The Burra Electoral District is represented in the Legislative Assembly by J.B .Neales and A. McCullock [sic].

Burra Show Society

Annual Report of the President, M. Stockman.

Burra show was held on 9 October in ideal fine cool weather.	It was very successful with gate takings of £258 – a record for many years.  Immediate Past President Mr Rex Warnes, who is also President of the Royal Adelaide Show, opened our show.

Horses in action had a record 548 entries.  Mr Roy Jeffrey had the marathon job of judging this section.  We must consider having two rings going at once to reduce the time this year.

The number of entries in the sheep section continues to disappoint.

Wool was well represented.

I regret to report the deaths of two valuable supporters: Mr J.R. Field who was a member of the finance committee for a number of years and Mr Roy W. Lloyd who was a head steward and exhibitor for many years.

Thanks also go to Mr Bob Fuss for his ongoing work in altering fixtures and undertaking repairs.  He has been doing this for years and we hope will do so for many more.

Thanks also go to our secretaries Mr & Mrs Barry Taylor and the society will be the poorer for their transfer to another district and, of course, thanks go to the Vice-Presidents and the committee.

Burra Town Council, 28 February

The caravan park will be rubbled.

Burra Caravan Park with its facilities on the north side of the swimming pool is expected to be sufficiently advanced to allow its opening over the Easter weekend.  Work on the amenities block is advancing with plumbing almost completed and electric wiring installed and ready for connection.  Concreting of floors and plastering is under way.  Painting may not be completed in time for Easter, but that would not prevent use.  The park will be completed for a cost of $6,000 and is eligible for a $3,000 subsidy from the SA Government Tourist Bureau.

Burra Primary School, Annual Parents’ Meeting

Last year 40 attended.  This year was closer to average with just 19, even though 129 families are represented in the school.  This is disappointing.

Elected: Chairman, Mr R. Moreland; Secretary-Treasurer, Mr D. Bannister.

In the past year the new school oval was sown and is now in an excellent condition.  Goal posts will be erected next week.  Sports Day 1965 was held on the War Memorial Oval and was a great success.  Arbor Day was held on 13 August when John Riggs was guest speaker.  The Passing Out Parade was held on 16 December, when R. Moreland and Mrs Carpenter presented the prizes.  Following discussions with ETSA and the Public Buildings Department a new power line has been laid and rewiring of the school is about to commence.  This will allow more lights and heaters.  Four fans have been purchased for the wooden rooms.  All subsidies have now been granted for the library and we can now go ahead with the final setting up of the library.  The school is to be repainted at the end of April at a cost of $11,000.  A grant of $3,000 from the Highways Department will allow all access roads to be sealed.  The grounds in front of the school are in the process of being transferred to the Education Department with the aid of the Town Council.

Burra RSL President (H. Cornelius) Annual Report

The Anzac Parade and Service were held as usual.  Attendance was somewhat marred due to the parade the following day in Adelaide.  Rev. G.D. Sibly conducted the service.  The Marananga Band led the march and supplied the music for the service.  The evening service was held in St Mary’s and was conducted by Revs Sibly and Lind.  Rev. Sibly also conducted the Remembrance Day Service on 11 November.  David Marshall’s Band from Morgan supplied music for our annual ball.  This was successful despite heavy rain with thunder and lightning and a power failure during the preceding cocktail party.  Badges were sold for Anzac, Legacy, Myrtle Bank and Poppy Day.  On each occasion $40 to $50 was taken.  We continue to support two Legacy wards.  Two of our members left the town during the year: Herb. Riggs, a WWI digger and W. (Bill) Kotz, A WWII digger.  Two diggers died during the period: Les. Hirschausen and Les. James.

[The usual thanks were extended to the committee members, the Ladies’ Auxiliary etc.]

Burra 100 Years Ago.  (Continued from last week.)

Redruth or Aberdeen is a small mining township in the Hundred of Kooringa.  It adjoins the Burra Mine on the eastern side of Burra Creek.  On the western side is a small township called Aberdeen.

[This messy description is in the original.]

The two are united by an excellent stone bridge with one arch and a span of 60 feet.

[This is incorrect: while there were probably stone abutments, the bridge was of timber and by 1879 the decay of the wood caused its replacement with a steel structure.]

The towns are supplies with water from wells about 30 feet deep on the surrounding hills.  Redruth is chiefly occupied by miners from the Burra Mine and smelters from the Kooringa Smelting Works.  There is a mine, the Bon Accord, not now working, adjoining the Burra Mine, and although large sums have been spent no copper has been found over the Burra Burra Mine boundary, though within a few yards of that boundary some of the richest ore raised ahs been discovered.

Communication with Hampton (½ mile), Kooringa (1 mile) and Copperhouse (1½ miles) in by rough bush roads and with Adelaide by four-wheeled coach via Kapunda and thence by rail.  There is one hospital for miners’ use only, supported by the mine.

Hotels are in Redruth, the Bushman’s Home and the Court House and in Aberdeen, the Smelters’ Home and the White Hart, recently transferred from Copperhouse.

[This ‘transfer’ has no support elsewhere.  The archaeological survey when the Ludgvan Street deviation was put in during the late 1980s reported the following points about the White Hart:

Allotments 147 & 148 of Aberdeen were sold September 1849 from Morehead & Young to William Spargo for £20.

Spargo erected a dwelling house and brewery.

13 March 1851 Spargo sold the site to John Magor for £200.  The conveyance is dated 16 July 1852.  The issue of a liquor license [in 1852] suggests the White Hart was constructed by then.

The report then traces the ownership of the property and of the licence to its demise as a hotel.  Mrs Mary Mowatt was the last licensee.

She surrendered the licence in 1892, but apparently left in 1888 to run the Old Lion in North Adelaide.

The owner in 1888 was Mrs Mary Ann Reed who died in 1889 and the property then vested in her son Richard Reed.

An advertisement in the ‘Burra Record’ 18 November 1887 says it is being conducted as a Temperance Hotel, suggesting that Mrs Mowatt had left by then and the hotel licence was no longer active.

References to its operation as a temperance hotel continue through to at least 1894.

The same paper records the destruction of the building by fire 14 March 1916, when it is said to be owned by James Reed and to have then been used as the home of Mrs A. Sara and also in part to have housed the Boy Scouts.  James Reed was a son of Richard Reed.

Mrs A. Sara (1859-1931) was the widow of George Sara (1839-1903) and a sister to James Reed.]

There are more hotels in these towns than in Kooringa because there the land is on leasehold from the mining company and the landlord will not allow more than three hotels.  In Redruth and Aberdeen they are built on freehold land.

The surrounding country is undulating and hilly.  All timber within 20 miles has been cut and used on the mine.  Not a tree can be seen within five miles and beyond that only on long purchased property.

Redruth contains a commodious court house, a well-built gaol (the furthest north) capable of accommodating 30 prisoners, and a police station.  It also contains a Wesleyan, a German Lutheran and a Primitive Methodist Chapel.  There is a private licensed school of nearly 100 scholars.

The installation of a second-hand crusher should result in improved open surface roads in the district.

The resultant materials are more easily consolidated prior to the application of bitumen.  This has been seen in the Burra School approaches and sections of Smelts Road.

The Council investigated the use of a grid-roller, but this left two-inch stones embedded in the surface.  Initially the results were good, but subsequent grading saw this larger material ripped from the surface.  Trials using a ‘rock-buster’ also proved unsatisfactory.  A unit available at Penola proved to be the answer.  At Penola it was a fixture, but it has now been made mobile.  This second-hand crusher with modifications has been obtained for $7,000.  A new crusher of this type would cost $20,000 to$ 24,000.  Depending on the size of the stone required it can produce from 200 to 400 yards per day.  [The report goes on to give further details of its operation.]

Burra National Trust held its AGM at Burra Town Hall on 5 April.  Elected: President, A. Tennant; Vice-President, S.J. Woollacott; Treasurer, Miss Marcia Tiver and Secretary, Miss Mary Woollacott.

The Trust is still collecting items and donations for its Market Square Museum project.  The appeal will close on 29 April, with the opening of the museum scheduled for late September.

The President’s Report

The Trust wishes to see Paxton Square preserved and made enquiries about taking over from the Lewis Trust.  This revealed that it would be likely to involved long and costly legal proceedings and so further action has been deferred indefinitely.  The Trust appreciates the moving of the jinker to its present central site.

Dower’s old shop was purchased by the President for $1,000 and presented to the National Trust Burra Branch free of encumbrances.  The title is held by Headquarters, but control of the building and its maintenance rests with the Burra Branch.  The cost of repairs has been $1,186.  This is much more than anticipated, but involved repairs common to old buildings to most of the guttering and the complete replastering of the front room.  A wall was removed to make a good-sized room for display.  The three other rooms have not yet had work done on them and in time they will need replastering and new floors due to termite damage.  Headquarters loaned $420 for repairs (to be paid back without interest).  The appeal for funds so far has realised $895.80 of the $1,600 aimed for.

Some gifts for display have been received for which the Trust is appreciative.

Trust Headquarters feels that the dugouts are in such a poor state of repair that maintenance is beyond the present finances of the branch.  Headquarters is also addressing the old Reformatory and is contacting the appropriate authorities to prevent demolition.

Obituary.  The late A.B. Riggs.

Mr Alf Riggs was born in Burra 26 March 1881 and was engaged in the pastoral industry, while also taking a very active part in civic affairs.  After his education at Burra School he took the position of book-keeper with Drew & Crewes before joining his father and brothers on their Murkaby property east of Burra.  In 1913 he married Miss Myrtle Fuss of Aberdeen and they lived first at Murkaby before moving to Burra North in 1919 and in 1924 to his later residence on Smelts Road.  In 1924 he was also made a JP.  He was a Town Councillor for North Ward for several years before becoming Mayor for 1929-30.  He was also a member of the Burra Hospital Board and active in the Redruth Methodist Church, being a Circuit Steward.  He maintained a keen interest in the pastoral industry and was a member of the Stockowners’ Association of SA.  He was made a life member of the Agricultural Bureau and was an active committeeman of the Burra Show Society, and had also held the presidency.  He was actively associated with the sheep dog trials when they were held in Burra.  Mr Riggs had great interest in Burra Primary and High Schools.  He was a member of the Primary School Committee and later of the High School Council, of which he was Chairman for several terms.  Riggs House at BHS is named after him, in recognition of his years of service.  He was interested in most of the town’s sports, but most particularly in rifle shooting.  During WWII he was a member of the Fathers’ Association and secretary of the committee that farewelled servicemen.  He was a keen Freemason and was Master of all the Kooringa Lodges as well as treasurer for many years.  He was also a keen reader and served on the Committee of the Burra Library, where he was granted Life Membership.  He is survived by a widow, two daughters and one son.

Burra Silo

The new grain silo now under construction at Burra North will enable bulk barley to be handled in the coming season.  Although this second silo at Burra is intended primarily for wheat, it will accept barley for direct trucking during the coming season.  Two grades can be accepted – one in each cell, but this will only be prior to the commencement of the wheat intake or during a break in the wheat harvest.  Work has been going on for some time.  Pouring of the cells began at 7.30 a.m. yesterday.

The rest of column 1 is unreadable

Once pouring begins it is necessary to continue in 12-hour shifts with 25 men employed on each shift.  The large mixer handles half a cubic yard of mix every three minutes.  The forming, about four feet high all round the complete shape of the silo, is automatically lifted in a working cycle of three-quarters of an inch every four minutes.  About 30 hydraulic jacks are attached to the one inch rods, which continue up through the walls, forming part of the reinforcing.  Parallel reinforcing rods are also placed every five inches for the first 50-60 feet and then every three inches, reverting to every five inches near the top.  The concrete is tipped from the hopper into a holding bin and is distributed manually around the forming using a wheelbarrow and then consolidated with a vibrator.  Given good conditions 15 to 16 feet can be poured in a 12-hour shift.

The contracting party is C.H. Martin Ltd.  When completed the silo will hold 111,000 bushels of grain.

Burra Primary School has won an award of $100 from the Savings Bank of SA for ‘thorough and effective instruction in the subject of thrift’.  Since it will attract a 100% subsidy, it will enable the purchase of $200 worth of library books.

Burra Caravan Park was officially opened on Friday morning by the Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau Mr P.F. Pollnitz, in fine, but very windy conditions.  Mr Pollnitz said the first class facilities would bring added prosperity to the town.

C.P. Mountford, the noted anthropologist, was born in Hallett and educated there until the age of 11.  Mr Mountford passed through Burra on Friday on his way to inspect some cave paintings in a remote part of Wilpena Pound.  As a colleague of Mr Pollnitz he was present also at the opening of the caravan park.  He describes himself as an amateur anthropologist, but has spent forty years in study and practical research.  One of his best-known books is entitled Brown Men and Red Sand.

Burra Town Council intends to beautify the Burra Creek area between the Red Bridge and the northern end of the caravan park, by planting additional trees and/or shrubs.

Burra & District Ambulance Association has decided to apply to the St John Council for a subsidy on a new ambulance.  The present ambulance is considered inadequate.  It would be retained as a mobile first aid room as its trade in value is negligible.  It has completed c. 25,000 miles.  The Association also feels it is time for the erection of a worthy building.  A membership drive will also be held.

Aberdeen Basketball Club organised an entertainment at the Burra Town Hall on Friday night with Eddie white’s Band from Adelaide and with TV personality Ernie Sigley as guest artist.  315 people attended.  Car troubles delayed Me Sigley’s arrival, but be compensated by performing for the entire evening instead of for a much shorter period.  The evening was a success.

Messrs H.L. Cullen & Son will complete 17 years on the Eastern Mail Run when the contract with the PMG expires at the end of the month.  They have covered nearly 350,000 miles on the 376 mile trip each week.  Added to that is the general carrying of many more thousands of miles.  In the earlier days the route was a mere track and occasionally the truck was bogged down to its tray.  Despite this there has been only one occasion when the run was not completed in the three day schedule of Friday to Sunday.  On that occasion they were not back until the following Thursday.  On the 376 mile trip there are only five ramps, but over 100 gates to open and close.  Mr Cullen will continue his general carrying business, but from Friday the mail run will be operated by Mr I.T. Allen.

Mr B.G. Dangerfield, Tree Advisory Officer for the Botanic Gardens, inspected the Burra Creek area from the Red Bridge to the Caravan Park.  He has recommended the removal of 25 pines because they are growing too close together and the thinning will allow each to achieve a better shape.  Their loss should be compensated by replanting with variations in species at strategic points.  He has recommended planting 7 red gums, 9 red ironbarks, 3 SA bluegums.  Rather surprisingly he also recommended planting 10 pepper trees to act as screens hiding the ugly rear of buildings and sheds.  Three kurrajongs were recommended for shade in the parking area at the swimming pool and four claret ashes for shade in the lawned areas.  He also recommended two more weeping willows.

‘Non-Local Music Lover’ writes condemning the district residents for not supporting local talent when it appears in concerts, recitals etc.  Such events are never attended by more than 100 and takings are less than $100.  It is a pity.

Burra Youth Club has been given the rent free use of their hall by Burra RSL.  The club will therefore meet there in future on Saturday evenings from 7 to 9 p.m.  This venue will have more amenities and more hygienic premises.

[Note.  The club had been formed in November 1963 and from 26 June 1964 had been meeting in the Salvation Army Citadel.  At the time this was not being used by the Salvation Army, but they revived services in Burra from 6 March 1966.]

The Council declared a general rate of 19.75c in the dollar and a special rate of 1⅔c in the dollar.  Minimum rate payable to be $12.

The proposed works program will concentrate on Burra North roadworks.

Other aspects include extension of street lighting, the Memorial Oval fence, weed spraying, more street names, tree planting and general painting.

The Burra North Playground will receive some attention and the park by Merther Street and the Creek Reserve [from the Red Bridge to the Caravan Park] will both receive some beautification.

Weather.

Sunday’s weather was dominated by gale force winds, but also featured rain, hail and snow.  East of the ranges it was dust that accompanied the wind.  Early on Sunday night light snow fell in Burra with heavier falls at Booborowie North and Hallett.  Light rain fell on Monday and the post office registered 33 points to 9 a.m.  At Princess Royal 58 points fell.  By Tuesday morning falls of up to one inch were reported from Hanson, Farrell Flat and Koonoona.  Mongolata reported 33 points and Baldina 38.  Mt Bryan East received 63.

St Mary’s Music Recital on Sunday last was held in icy conditions and only about 35 people braved the weather.  [The program is reviewed.]  The collection has brought the total to within a few dollars of the $400 target for improving the church’s surroundings.

The Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan, in response to a question in Parliament said that exploration work at Burra Mine was continuing.  At present there were two percussion drills operating in and around the open cut and a diamond drill south of the open cut.

Metallurgical work is also continuing on the problem of extracting the copper from the oxidised leavings.

The Minister also assured the Hon. R.A.

Burra Oval Improvement is to continue.  With the football season over and cricket clubs having made other arrangements, it is intended to completely top dress the playing area.  A section of the front wall (on the western side) is to be removed and replaced with cyclone fencing.  The material from the wall will be used to form a parking area around part of the western side.  Changes will be made to the road around the oval to delete most traffic hazards and make for freer movement, particularly around the dressing and refreshment rooms.

Proceedings began with a small procession of horse drawn vehicles and Mr Les Warnes in his Newton Bennet car c. 1910 vintage.  Mr Bob Radford drove the governess cart from Princess Royal, Mal Kellock drove a buggy and Mr Arnold Heinrich drove a cart.  [Official guests were as listed in last week’s paper.]

Mr Tennant said that Mr H.C .Morphett, a past president of the National Trust had come to Burra in about 1963 and following his visit a meeting was called to see if a branch could be formed here.

Fire

A fire broke our just before 6 a.m. in the home of Mr & Mrs R. Spackman in Chapel Street.  Mr & Mrs Spackman were awakened by the smell of smoke and saw flames coming from the back bedroom where their six-year-old son Peter was sleeping.  He escaped with slight burns to his head.  Mr Spackman attempted to extinguish the fire with a garden hose while Mrs Spackman was getting four other children out of the house.  (Two of the boys were not at home at the time.)  The fire brigade saved the front area of the house, which was not insured.  Damage is estimated at c. $1,500.  The cause of the fire is unknown.  Many locals have given donations of clothing etc. and money has been given by the Burra Benevolent Fund and the PMG Distress Fund.  Mrs D. Carpenter of Burra North has provided temporary accommodation.  The adjoining home of Mr & Mrs W.H .Wahlert was saved, but suffered extensive smoke damage.

The garden area by the bridge in Main Street has been cleared out and in future will be maintained as a lawn.

‘The main Adelaide road has been cleaned so that it can be mowed.’

The season had one A team and two B teams as well as a junior team.  The A and junior teams were premiers.

The three courts were top dressed.  A cyclone fence was erected and the toilets were painted and the new toilets have been paid off.  Lloyd Turner and his family were farewelled in late July, having been stalwart supporters.  The Easter Tournament was the highlight of the year and saw record entries and excellent weather.

In most sections entries were up, though there were fewer ring entries.

Mr G. Stanley Hawker opened the show.

The sheep section could do with a lift, though it was stronger than usual.

The Flower Pavilion looked a treat.

The schools deserve to be congratulated for their display.

The Aberdeen Colts had done well.

The Aberdeen Club has meant that there are now six teams in the town whereas six years ago there were only two and it was hard for a lad to get a game.

Mr B.L. Hirschausen said the club’s defeats were due to a lack of training.  This should improve next year when the club hopes to erect lights on the oval and so have one big training night per week.

Legislative Council

The death of the Hon. C.C. Dudley Octoman has caused a by-election for the Northern District next Saturday 29 October.  [In the advertising article for the Liberal Party a neat constitutional history is given of the Legislative Council over the preceding century or so.]

1836-42	The control of the colony was largely in the hands of the Governor with the Board of Colonization Commissioners in control of emigration and revenues from the sale of land.

1842	SA became a Crown Colony with the Governor controlling the administration, aided by a seven-man nominated Council.

1851	The Council was changed to 16 elected members and 8 nominated members.

1857	Responsible Government was granted with a bicameral system using the secret ballot for the first time.  From 1857 to 1882 the Legislative Council comprised 18 members elected on a property qualification and returned by the whole province.

1882-1902	The 24 members were returned from 4 districts.

1902	The Legislative Council was reduced to 18 members.

1915-1966	The Legislative Council comprised 20 members.  The state was divided into three Country and two Metropolitan Districts, each returning four members.  (Northern, Midland, Southern Districts in the Country and Central No. 1 and Central No. 2 for the city.)

The Northern District is vast, stretching from Renmark to Port Lincoln and to the Northern Territory border and from the western to the eastern borders.  It covers nine House of Assembly electorates.

The four members are elected for six year terms, with half retiring usually every three years.

Membership is restricted to:

British subject for at least 30 years and resident in SA for 3 years.

Voters must be either owners of a freehold estate of clear value $100, leaseholders of an estate of clear annual value of $40 on a lease for at least three years or with right of purchase.

Or be a registered proprietor of a Crown Lease on which improvements value at least $100.

Or be an inhabitant occupying a dwelling house.  (i.e. anyone paying rent.)

Or be a returned serviceman or woman.

Be aged at least 21 years (unless entitled under the serviceman or woman provision.)

Voting is not compulsory.

Had Mr Playford been returned at the last election the vote would have been extended to spouses of those entitled to vote.

Burra Pictures

The Secretary of the Burra Pictures Committee Mr A.R. Graham reports on a severe decline in attendance.  The operation has been making a loss for the past twelve months except for a few nights.  The cost of running is c. $40 a show, but on some nights receipts have been as low as $16 and on a number of nights in the range $20-$25.  In eleven weeks since 5 September the average attendance has been 64, including children, with a low of 31 and a high of 109.  The secretary seeks any suggestions, as he would like to see the pictures continue, but this cannot be done with continued losses.

Weather

November was very dry and farmers were preparing to harvest grain following several centuries.  The eastern pastoral areas have been in drought.  It began to rain on Wednesday and continued through the week with falls of from 3 to 5 inches.

Until Saturday night the rain had been fairly light, but constant with only a few heavy showers.  Thundery conditions on Saturday and Sunday brought much heavier falls and run-off resulting in some washaways and damage to fencing.  Some water catchments to the east were replenished, but not to the same extend as in the inside country.  Most wheat seems to be standing the wet quite well with only a few reports of ‘shooting’.

Some barley and oats crops have been badly affected.  Considerable sheep losses have been reported due to the sudden change in temperatures and crowding in the corners of paddocks, leading to smothering.  Losses of up to 300 and perhaps more have been mentioned.  Overall these have been the best pastoral rains for years.

During the week Booborowie reported 343 points, Hallett 362, Mt Bryan 451, Burra 384, World’s End 327 and Mt Bryan East 431.  To the east Balah got 212, Braemar 379, Woolgangi 309, Redcliffe 500, Koomooloo 290, Pine Valley, 358, Old Koomooloo 300, Glenora 359, Thistlebeds 448, Baldina 480 and Mallett 400.

Burra Swimming Pool has had some minor repairs and will be ready to open again in a day or two.  It is to be open every night when practicable in the swimming season.

Burra Primary School has announced that through the generosity of Mr Andrew Tennant an annual prize will be awarded in perpetuity to the Dux of the school each year.  A sum has been invested to yield approximately $20 p.a.  The award will go to the student with best results in the Progress Certificate Examination.

Burra Town Council will sponsor trial runs of salvaging paper waste through the town.  A suggestion has been made that any income so derived should go towards replacing the badly worn floor in the Town Hall.

The St John Appeal has reached $928.

Twenty Persons were fined in the Burra Police Court on Wednesday for failure to have a licence as required under the Broadcasting and Television Licensing Act.

A Plaque to Commemorate Sir Hubert Wilkins was unveiled at the Hallett Institute on

Burra Silos wheat intake is expected to reach 300,000 bushels this season.  The first load from V.G. & M.K. Simpson of Mt Bryan was delivered on 29 November.  The wheat has been of good quality despite the rains in December and has averaged 62 lb per bushel.  The 264, 324 bushels received to Monday is the greatest intake since bulk receivals at Burra.  The second silo has contributed to this.  Very little local wheat has gone elsewhere and very little from outside the district has been delivered at Burra.  Both silos were filled to capacity on 3 January.

Learn to Swim Campaign.  At Burra 140-160 youngsters are receiving instruction.  About 70 of them are taking part for the first time.  Mr Paul Tattersall is being assisted by Miss Rosemary Reed and Russell Nicholls.  Miss Sue Murphy will join them next week.

Weather.  December in Burra was the second wettest on record and the total of 427 points recorded was exceeded only in 1962 with 456 points.  1929 recorded 426 points in December.

Seat Belts.  New cars registered after 1 January 1967 must be fitted with seat belts for the driver and one front seat passenger.

Swimming.  The first night of the Inter-Club Carnival between Spalding, Clare and Burra was held at Clare on Friday night.  Clare came first followed by Burra and Spalding.  The next round is at Burra on 27 January.

Burra High School: Headmaster’s Report for 1966

The Headmaster welcomed Mr & Mrs Baulderstone and the guest speaker Dr Southgate & Mrs Southgate and other guests.  He regretted the death in the year of Mr [A.B.] Riggs, one of the House Patrons and a former Chairman of the High School Council.

The year began with 170 students, slightly down on 1965, due mainly to a very small Leaving Class.  Numbers should be steady for some time to come and the emphasis in coming years will be on lengthening the time at school.  1965 produced the most successful Leaving Class ever, with 18 Certificates and a Commonwealth Open Entrance Scholarship won by Denise Griffen.  The Intermediate results were unfortunately far less satisfactory.

The school is in the process of being painted and structural alterations have been made to the Headmaster’s Office, the Library and the Home Science Room.  At last a comfortable and roomy staff room has been provided.  Portions of the yard were repaved and the toilets remodelled.  Thanks to the Parents & Friends’ Association changing rooms on the playing fields were completed and put to use.

Prefects were inducted in March and the Parents & Friends’ Association Annual Ball was held at the end of Term 2.  Arbor Day was celebrated in July by planting trees along the Burra Creek.

Two special religious services were conducted – a combined Methodist and Anglican Easter Assembly, and a Valedictory Service for the second successive year was held in St Mary’s last Sunday evening.

In October the Director of Education, Mr Mander Jones, visited and after opening the new Primary School Library, he addressed the High School Students and reviewed a display of work in the school hall and saw the excellent range of new library books.

Open Night was again held at the start of Term 2, but this year fewer parents came along.

Sport has again played an important part in the school, with a very successful Sports Day in April.  Steele House won the Swimming Cup in March.

At the Inter-High School Sports Day at Kapunda, Burra was successful in retaining the Handicap Shield.  Inter-school winter sports matches were contested against Balaklava and Riverton High Schools (but the less said of the results the better).  Summer sports will be played against Riverton tomorrow.

Another highlight of the year was the tour by 32 senior students and four teachers to Tasmania in September.  Unfortunately the planned camp at Melrose 10 days ago for the Junior School had to be cancelled due to wet weather.  It has been postponed to February.

The club period changed this year.  In Term 1 the lesson was given over to cultural activities such as drama, musical appreciation, singing and art work.  In Term 2 the whole school engaged in debating and public speaking.

Future changes.  The Intermediate Examination is to be abandoned, with no external examination staged by the Education Department at that level either.  It is also probable that the Alternative Course will be extended into the Leaving year.  It remains to be seen how many students will wish to study a PEB type course where there will be no external examination until Leaving level and how many will take the High Schools Alternative Course.  The nature of the gap between the two courses is also as yet unknown.

Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships will be available, awarded on the results of a special mid-year examination (held for the first time this year).  Two of our students gained one this year: Christine Reincke & Shirley Crew – both of them are leaving Burra.

[The Headmaster then discussed the problem of student boredom, their wandering the streets at night and their lack of manners.  He went on to the usual acknowledgement of the work of the Parents & Friends’ Association, the High School Council, the High School staff and the religious instructors.]

Changes for 1967: Miss Briggs moves to the new Elizabeth West H.S. and Miss Jones will return as Mrs Day.

Accident/Obituary.  Retired grazier Mr Donald Roy McInnes aged 75 of ‘Donara’ Hallett, was killed instantly in a level crossing smash on Thursday.  He was travelling in a car, which was struck at a level crossing between Mt Bryan and Hallett at about 8.45 a.m. by a goods train travelling south.  He had been going to collect the daily paper from a roadside delivery box.  The RSL funeral was arranged by the Hallett Sub-branch for Friday afternoon.  130-140 cars formed the cortege.  Mr McInnis was born in the Hawker District and transferred to Gulnare as a share farmer in 1914.  He enlisted in the First AIF from Spalding.  He was wounded in action in France and returned home, purchasing a property at Hallett in 1919.  He married Miss Clara Scholz.  He worked hard and established his four sons on the land.  In his early days he was a keen and active member of Hallett Tennis Club and a follower of the football team.  Later in life he was interested in bowls.  ‘Donara’ Stud was established in 1945 on the original property, but later in 1958 it was transferred to the old ‘Cartapoo’ property, which still remains the registered stud of ‘Donara’.  Mr McInnis was a keen judge of sheep and was very astute when it came to their value.  He enjoyed a success in the show ring as well as stud breeding in general.  He was a foundation member of Hallett RSL and was about to retire to Adelaide.

[Born 24 December 1892 Willow Plains: died 12 January 1967 near Hallett, residence Donara Station.]

Road Blocks were set up in various places after an armed robbery at Klemzig ANZ Bank branch on Thursday.  One was on the Burra-Hanson Road near the by-pass turn-off.  Four men have since been arrested.

Theft.  Jennison’s Tyre Service was broken into on the night of Monday 9 January and goods to a value in excess of $500 were stolen.  The rear door was forced.  Several of the items stolen were apparently later thrown from a car on the Morgan Road and found on Wednesday morning by Mr Alec Ford.

Burra Primary School.  A large number of students gained certificates in the Lear to Swim Campaign.  Mr Lannan and Mrs Said volunteered for the teaching job.  [A list of certificate winners is printed.]

Burra National Trust met at the Mayor’s Parlour on Wednesday and discussed the future of the Redruth Gaol.  The building stands on 8 acres of Crown Land and until recently was the property of the Gaols & Prisons Department.  The Lands Department has agreed to give the Wardenship of the building and grounds to a local body.  The Burra Town Council and the National Trust have both been interested in preserving and partially restoring this fine example of early SA architecture.  It has long been an attraction to tourists and without any local authority having responsibility for it has been subject to an increasing amount of vandalism.  The meeting decided it was best regarded as a joint undertaking of the National Trust and Council.  The Council should be the body to approach the Lands Department and it was also in the best position to approach the Tourist Bureau for financial help.  The fate of other historic buildings in the town came under discussion.  Tourist interest in the town is rapidly increasing.  Burra is fortunate not to have become subject to ruthless changes and remains a rare example of a town whose history can readily be traced by any exploring visitor.  Its tourist potential is great, but is only gradually being realised.

The Gaol was erected in 1852 at a cost of £3040 and occupied in 1853.  It was the first Gaol outside of Adelaide and served the whole of the north for many years.  It could hold about 30 prisoners.  The first gaoler was Mr Thomas Perry, who was paid £168 p.a.  There was also a turnkey and a warder.  ‘It remained a Gaol well into this century when for a few years it became a Girls’ Reformatory.’

[This information is incorrect.  The Gaol was built in 1856 and operated until 1894.  In 1897 it was refurbished as a Girls’ Reformatory and had this role until 1922.]

Burra Camera Club held its first meeting for the year at Mr & Mrs Lind’s.  The club aims to attract more entries to the Photographic Section of the Burra Show.  [Ideas for the year’s meetings are listed.]

‘Inky’ Sellars came in recently with a query concerning the date of Queen Victoria’s death.  He recalled getting a half holiday at school, but couldn’t recall whether it was 21, 22 or 23 January 1901.  Mr Auhl, the present headmaster, was able to discover that ‘Inky’ was there in Grade II, having transferred from Miss Bentley’s School after Grade I.  Queen Victoria died on 22 January and the school got a half holiday of 23 January.

[A list of ‘Inky’s’ classmates is printed.  ‘Inky’ was Roy Sellars 1891-1969.  See 88, 31 (2), 10 Aug. 1965, page 1.]

The branch conceded temporary wardenship of the Gaol to the Town Council to take care of and maintain the building when it is released by the Lands Department.  On 3 January Messrs Game & Cooper of Adelaide National Trust inspected places of historical interest in Burra and were impressed by the town’s tourist potential.  Rev. Maurice Lind has produced a brochure concerning the history and places of interest in Burra District, which will be sold in Burra.  It is the result of painstaking research.  It is hoped to open the Museum more regularly, but it is not easy to roster an attendant.  Mr R. Fuss has done a fine job in opening it twice a week through the holidays and often more than that.  Recent gifts to the Museum are a ‘tumbling tommy’ plough and a sheep bell.

Old Burra Photographs

Mr R. Noye has sent to this office some photographs of Burra and the Burra Mine taken in 1905.  While rummaging through the old blacksmith’s shop in Riverton, belonging to Mr Scholz, he came across nearly 200 dry plates.  Mr Scholz had taken these photographs in 1905 and the plates were in excellent condition.  A number of them show Burra and the Mine.  Views include Graves’ Shaft, Johnny Green, Market Square, the treeless Burra Creek, the Open Cut, the Ballast Quarry and a general panorama of Kooringa.  This discovery followed a hint obtained by Mr Noye of their whereabouts.  He is making a collection as a keen photographer and researcher into early photography, for the Public Library of SA.  He would welcome any dry plates or old prints for copying.  Copies will be made available to the National Trust.

District School Enrolments

Burra High School enrolments remain steady at approximately 170, but the Leaving Class of 21 is the biggest in its history.  Miss c. Hodges has joined the staff as teacher of Girls’ Craft Subjects and she replaces Miss L. Briggs who has gone to Elizabeth West HS.  [New students are listed.]

Prefects elected for 1967:

James Braendler (Head), Stewart Catt (Deputy), Donald Griffen, Andrew Pearce & Roger Przibilla.

Angela Ryan (Head), Bronwyn Disher (Deputy), Beverley Collins, Rosemary Field, Lorraine Hyde & Heather Riggs.

Decimal Currency.  Today is the first anniversary of decimal currency.  The public has made many complaints about the continued use of £.s.d. in advertising, but from 1 August no contract entered into in £.s.d. will be enforceable.  75% of business machines have been converted and more than 75% of monetary transactions are done in decimal currency.  Nearly all business machines will have been converted by 1 August.  Most 3d pieces and half-pennies and pennies will have been returned to banks by then (though they remain legal tender for amount in multiples of 5c. (6d).  One of the biggest conversions yet to be completed is that of 100,000 price computing petrol pumps in 30,000 sites around Australia.

Historical Maps found at Steelton

When the old Steelton Post Office was demolished Mr V.R. Schmaal found some old maps and charts.  The old building was on the Marrabel-Waterloo Road and was built over 100 years ago.  It served as a post office until eight or ten years ago.  It was the former home of the late Mr H.G. Parker, who was the former postmaster and District Council Overseer.  He was also the District Clerk of the old Waterloo DC.  When it became unsafe in recent years, the owner, Mr B.T. Schmaal, decided to demolish it.  On receiving advice of the discovery Messrs A.E. Bannear, R.J. Noye and D.S. Overton visited Mr V.R. Schmaal and took over the historical documents.  A large SA Directory of 1915, which for many years was used as a door stop, was also taken over.

The collection comprises one lithograph map and five hand-drawn maps.  The lithograph shows the area in SA cultivated for wheat in the years 1870-1882 and the average yield per acre.  In 1870, the year the railway came to Saddleworth, the Saddleworth DC has 16,282 acres of wheat yielding 14 bushels per acre.  In the 1870s the Council area was 39,680 acres.  For the 13 years 1870-1882 the average wheat yield overall was 8 bushels per acre, which was amongst the highest in SA.  Three hand-drawn maps were prepared by the late F.G. Richardson, licensed surveyor, in 1871 & 1877 and dealt with changes to Government Reserves.  They are on linen.

The other two maps are the most interesting and are of Emuville and the Midland Road District.  The map of Emuville is a certified copy drawn in 1883 and recalls the early mining era and its effect on the Black Springs area.  In 1846 a well-known brewer, David Cudmore, built the Emuville Hotel alongside Emu Springs and the Government trough about two miles northeast of Black Springs.  The troughs are still in existence, but the hotel is a heap of rubble.  Cudmore stayed only a short while, as he inherited a small fortune in Ireland.

Thomas Tapley took over and dispensed drinks to the thirsty teamsters working between Burra and Kapunda for the next seven years.  The hotel was at the junction of three roads to Burra and would have done a roaring trade in beer and hard liquor.

About 1850 the Karkulta Mine, a few miles north of the hotel, was expected to become another Burra Mine and two towns were laid out near the springs.  One was Glandore [sic: for Glendore] (now known as Black Springs) and the other, right adjacent to the Emu Hotel was Emuville, comprising 36 blocks of one to four acres; laid out by Edmund Bowman.  However, the Karkulta Mine proved a disappointment and today Emuville is just a name on the map.

The other map of 1875 shows the roads under the care of the Midlands Road Board – an area extending from Pt Wakefield to Morgan and from Kapunda to Burra and it clears up much of the doubt which exists about the routes of the early roads.  At this time the main road to Burra was the ‘Middle Road’ via Kapunda, Hamilton, Waterloo and Black Springs.  The other route was via the ‘West Road’, which in a general way followed the modern bitumen road.  ‘Morris Bridge’ on the Saddleworth-Steelton Road was constructed by the Road Board and named after its secretary.  One variation shows that in 1875 the route south of Riverton went through the small settlement of Navan, east of the present bitumen.  The discovery of these maps brings home the importance of preserving such relics before they are lost forever or are snapped up by hungry antique dealers.

Mobile Kitchen Destroyed by Fire.

A party comprising Gordon Wooton, Stan Beinke, Jimmie Taylor, Trevor Baker, Bob Taylor and Jack Stannard are part of a Highway’s Department gang road making 100 miles north of Yunta.  On Tuesday last week, with temperature about 118°F they were transferring the camp and machinery from Wertaloona to Curnamona.  The 18 ft x 20 ft [sic:!] caravan kitchen, which accommodated twelve men at meal times, caught fire about four miles south of Frome Downs.  The ‘train’ of vehicles was turned into the wind and an attempt was made to extinguish the fire, but all that could be saved of the kitchen was the bottled gas container.  The truck and smaller van were not damaged, but all the food, furniture and utensils were lost.  The cook, Jack Stannard, lost a deal of personal belongings.  The roads in these areas of drift sand and watercourses will enable large numbers of cattle to be transported from the northern areas to Frome Downs by road.  Temperatures like Tuesday’s have been experienced for a week and for the preceding four days a severe dust storm had raged.

They then went on to the Mine area, the old Redruth Gaol and other places of interest.  Mr Ian Auhl outlined the story of the Mine and of the historic buildings.  Teamsters from Burra were often bogged near Halbury en route to Pt Wakefield and later a corduroy road of split pine logs was laid across this boggy section.  Some 40 adults accompanied the students and some of the farmers among them said the old bullock tracks across their properties are still well defined, as wheat does not grow as tall along the 100-year-old tracks as in the rest of the crop.

Burra High School.  Thirty-four students and seven teachers enjoyed a school camp and trek up Mt Remarkable at the weekend at a camp, which had been postponed because of heavy rain at the end of 1966.  Luncheon was taken at the summit of the climb.  The camp was a great success.

Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM

The date for this year’s show will be 7 October.

M.G. Stockman was re-elected President for a third term.  Mr Rex Stockman was elected Senior Vice-President and Mr R. Mason is the Junior Vice-President.  G. Stanley Hawker is the Patron.  The distribution of electricity on the grounds has to be reorganised because of the unsafe condition of existing poles.  A sub-committee will go into the matter and various other matters relating to improving the show were considered.  It was decided to ask the minister of Agriculture Mr Bywaters to open the 1967 show, or failing him, Mr C.R. Kelly MHR.  A minute of appreciation was recorded for the services of Mr H.J.B. Jennison over a long period.  He had earlier indicated he would like to retire from the committee in favour of a younger member.

The President reported a successful 1966 show, held in perfect weather with a total of 2,450 entries.  Horses in Action remained a highlight.  Numbers were down on the previous year’s record, but quality was much in evidence.  Wool entries were up with the best types in the district.  The Sheep Pavilion was nicely filled and young breeders are to be commended for entering.

The Flower Pavilion was a picture despite some rough weather in the days leading up to the show.  Mrs Scroop and Mr R. Fuss are congratulated on the painting of the walls and tables.

District schools produced a fine display.  Industrial displays were numerous and comprehensive.  The Agricultural Pavilion was well filled with quality produce.  Dog and goat entries were of a high standard and poultry and birds were well represented as usual.

The death during the year of Mr A.B. Riggs is the loss of a valued member.  He was a life member and past president who did a great deal to support the show over many years.  Thanks to the new secretaries Mr & Mrs A. Graham, who learned fast and did a fine job.

Financially the show was a success and the overdraft is being slowly reduced.

Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM, which about 60 mothers attended representing about 50% of the families at the school.  Mrs J. Carpenter was elected President for the fourth year in succession.  The club had expended nearly $600 in the year.  Mr I.L. Auhl the Headmaster thanked office bearers and members for their support.  Other officers elected: Vice-Presidents, Mesdames P. Kirk & R. Pearse; Secretary, Mrs L. Braendler; Assistant Secretary, Mrs T. Pendlebury and Treasurer, Mrs R. Broad.

Burra High school held its induction ceremony for Prefects and the Acceptance of House Captains in the Avenue of Memory last Friday.  Nearly 150 parents and visitors attended.  [Details in 1 column.]

The RSL AGM was held last Friday night in the club rooms with the best attendance of members since 1961.  Mr Wilf Nankivell was re-elected President with Messrs B.A. Riggs and T.R. Rogers as Vice-Presidents.  Ben Kotz continues as Secretary with Mr Arthur Wright as Treasurer.  Mr Bert Cornelius reported that 1966 did not get away to a good start and when he could not continue in May due to ill health it looked as if the club might close.  In June one of the oldest members in Mr Wilf Nankivell consented to take over as President.  The work of the Women’s Auxiliary was much appreciated and through their efforts the club had been able to maintain its Legacy commitments.  Mr Nankivell thanked the headmasters of the schools for allowing students to attend the Armistice Day Service.  He hoped members would take a more active role in 1967.

Burra Primary School Welfare Club

The activities of 1966 are reported by Mrs J. Carpenter.  [In just over 1 column of detail.]

There were 62 financial members.  Some major activities included financing the installation of a backdrop for the tennis court (subsidised by the Education department).  They assisted at the school’s sports day in April when stalls raised $177.25.  There was some difficulty in getting the subsidy paid by the Education Department on the funds raised for library books, but after Mr Ron Moreland personally met with the Director of Education Mr Mander Jones, the problems were resolved.  Mr Mander Jones visited the school to officially open the painted and furnished library on 28 October.

Saddleworth & District Historical Society has acquired a thrashing roller donated by Otto Pfitzner and his son Roy of Tarnma.  Over 100 years ago some German settlers of Friedrichswalde (Tarnma since 1918) felled a huge red gum 23 feet long and over 4 feet in diameter.  In its green state Mr Bob Noye has estimated it weighed ten tons and seven tons when dry.  For months they worked on the log chipping away about five tons with hand tools to leave the two ton roller we see today.  It is a long tapered object with fluted sides.  It was fastened to a pole at its pointed end and rolled in a circle by two horses harnessed to a spindle on the larger end.  Large quantities of wheat could be threshed with a fraction of the effort of hand flailing.  Wally and Darryl Baldwin transported the item to Saddleworth, where it will be treated with preservative and mounted on a concrete base by the Institute.

Permission was granted for the committee to lease roadsides for cropping as per schedule provided the land cropped be no closer than half a chain from the centre line of road and the lessee is to be responsible for weed control for the term of the lease.  M.T. Carmody requested permission to crop the roadside for Hospital revenue and this was granted.

Stud Merino Field Days.  The annual round of Field Days will commence on 3 April at Para Glen Stud near Gawler and work north.  [Arrangements for the week are printed.]

Burra Town Council will take action shortly to recover outstanding rates.  The total rate income of Council is $19,789, of which $1,208 is in arrears.  The District Council has a rate income of c. $57,000 and is only $1,511 in arrears – mostly connected with estate dealings taking longer than normal to settle.

Ambulance Depot.  Following the purchase of a second ambulance for the Burra District the question of a suitable building to house the vehicles has been discussed on various occasions.  Now the Burra & District Association has invited the District EFS to join in the construction of a suitable Ambulance & EFS building to house both organisations and provide facilities for their crews.  Before this decision the Association had decided to draw up plans and specifications for an ambulance building and get estimates.  The most favoured site is on Council land adjacent to Richards Garage at Burra North.  Some financial assistance is anticipated from St John’s Brigade Headquarters.  It is felt that Civil Defence needs might be considered at the same time and an invitation has been extended to Mr Nicholls of the Civil Defence Department to address a public meeting on the matter.

St Mary’s Anglican Church

After years of discussion a big transfer of area from the Diocese of Adelaide to the Diocese of Willochra will take place on 1 April 1967.  The result will treble the number of priests and communicants in the Diocese of Willochra.  The enlarged Diocese will cover over 75% of SA, but will have less than 10% of the state’s population.  The area includes Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas, the Mid North and North of SA.  The occasion will be marked in Burra by a special service on 7 April to which leaders of all Christian denominations are invited.  The Bishop of Willochra Dr T. Jones will be tendered a Liturgical Reception in St Mary’s and Dr J.V. Peters will play the organ.  He has composed a special Introit to be used and the Quire of St Nicholas is coming from Adelaide to lead the singing.

Burra Primary School Parents’ Meeting was held last Monday. A special request for ‘Dads’ to attend received a good response and 52 parents attended.  Mr Moreland was elected Chairman of the School Committee for two years.  [Members of the Committee are listed.]

Burra Primary School Committee: Chairman Ron Moreland’s Report

The work on the school roads was started on schedule and with very satisfactory results.  Sports day was a great success and the Welfare Club ran a successful stall.  Arbor Day saw trees planted on the oval and in front of the school.  On 28 October the new library was opened by the Director of Education Mr E. Mander Jones.  The passing out parade was held on 15 December with Mr Farrow, Headmaster of the High School.  For the second year in succession we have had a teacher transferred within a week of commencing first term.  This is most undesirable, but answers from the Department have been neither helpful nor very satisfactory.  The long process of painting the building inside and out has resulted in a work of credit to the painters.  The creek through the oval is now ready to be levelled over thanks to donors of filling.  Halbury School Committee, teachers, pupils and parents visited on 3 March.  During the year we lost the services of Secretary Mr D. Bannister and we were fortunate that Mr L. Moore, manager of the Savings Bank, filled the position.  The Andrew Tennant Award is the first award the Primary School has received.  It was an award of $400 on which the amount is about $20 p.a.  The first award has gone to Ann Brak.

District Main Roads.  Announcement by S.C. Bevan, Minister of Roads.

Construction and sealing of the Spalding-Burra Road is not scheduled before 1970-71 because of the need to complete construction and sealing of the Clare-Hanson section of the Lochiel-Burra main road 46, which has commenced and is programmed for completion 1969-71.

Burra-Morgan Road should be upgraded to ‘open-surface’ standard beginning 1967-68.

National Route 23 to Broken Hill presently is the Tarlee-Clare-Jamestown-Peterborough road, but the best route would be Riverton-Saddleworth-Burra, which is shorter.  Route 23 signs will be re-allocated to it within the next three weeks.

Burra on TV

On Thursday last a film crew from National Television recorded the historical sites of Burra.  Well known Sydney cameraman Mr John Kingsford-Smith (nephew of Sir Charles) was in charge.  He has been the cameraman for the National TV series ‘Australian Heritage’.  Mr Ian Auhl provided the local historical background notes.  Mr Arthur Hiles, Secretary of the National Trust in Adelaide, had negotiated the choice of Burra on behalf of the Burra District National Trust.  Although the final film will run for only about five minutes, a great deal will be packed into the period.  It was shot in colour so it would not become dated when colour TV is introduced in a few years.  Mr Kingsford Smith decided the outstanding feature of the town compared with other Australian historical sites was the masonry of its old buildings.  He said he was astonished that with its tourist features Burra was so little known, even in SA.  The film will be shown on 38 stations of the ABC from time to time and will help to put Burra on the tourist map.  It is hoped to have it ready for TV within a month.

Ray Pietsch of the ANZ Bank in Burra has been transferred to Elizabeth Centre Branch after two years here.  Geoff Collins has joined the staff in Burra.

Burra High School Drama Club is seeking some adults to join them in a production later in the year.  They are considering doing G.B. Shaw’s Pygmalion.  The production would help raise funds for an interstate trip in September.

Fires

Three night fires have occurred in a fortnight in Burra.

On Saturday the brigade extinguished a blazing tree, which had been removed from Chapel Street some weeks earlier and dumped further along.

On Thursday night the old wood and iron toilet in the southeast corner of the Memorial Oval burnt down.

Yesterday morning the hedge at the home of Mr Bert Wardle in Mt Pleasant Road needed attention.

[‘Mrs Maggs’ column on page 7 adds that Mr & Mrs Wardle slept right through the excitement at their property.]

None of the fires caused any serious damage.

Mr Bob Fuss remembered recently that a rabbit he had chased 60* years ago had led him into a cave in the banks of the Burra Creek.  Thinking it over he returned to the scene and his memory had served him correctly.  The rabbit had its home in an old miner’s home in the bank of the creek.  The home is still there and if the cave-in was dug out it probably still has two of the rooms intact behind it.  Bob feels he is a little too old to excavate it.  Perhaps someone younger will undertake the job.  [*Corrected 90, 22 (2), 6 June 1967, page 7 to 70 years ago.]

Kooringa Flood

This occurred on 8 June and destroyed much property and the loss of a life.  On Whitsunday at about 3 p.m. it grew very dark in the southeast and there were occasional peals of thunder till 6.15 p.m. when a terrific peal broke as if over the mine.  Rail and hail fell in torrents and continued till about 10 p.m. when the heaviest weather passed to the northwest, but the rain continued.  About 3 in the morning huts in the bank were washed in and inhabitants driven out.  About 11 a.m. the Smelting Company’s bridge was washed away and in succession every bridge across the creek.  (They were all wooden bridges in 1851.)  Where the homeless will shelter is a puzzle.  A great many heaps of ore are lost and worst of all one life.  William Box aged 45, a widower with three children: the eldest aged 5 and the youngest a baby in arms, was killed.  His housekeeper says she went to bed about 11 p.m., but the baby was troublesome and she was worried about the floodwaters.  She awoke him and after putting her and the children in a higher house in the bank of the creek, he and a neighbour began removing the furniture.  By 2 a.m. the water was about two feet deep in the hut and while they were removing an article the roof fell in, knocking his comrade on the face.  He managed to crawl away, but Box was thrown onto his back with a large quantity of material on him, so he could not move.  It was daylight before he was got out and the body was taken to the nearest hotel [The Miners’ Arms: now the Burra] to await an inquest.  He apparently had about £400 in the hut.  There are few huts remaining, chiefly near the [old] cemetery.  In Kooringa shops were swamped with the street a complete river.  Last night the street was more than three feet deep by the post office.  A quantity of flour was destroyed and flour was selling for 58/- a bag.  The Smelting Works were stopped for want of fuel.  [It was later rumoured that the £400 had been recovered.]

The ‘Murdered by a German’ Tombstone

The Burra tombstone which has perhaps aroused most interest reads:

ERECTED

HIS BROTHER SEAMEN

TO THE MEMORY OF

JOHN SMITH

OF LONDON AGED 20 YEARS

WHO WAS MURDERED

BY A GERMAN

IN THE TOWNSHIP OF KOORINGA

ON CHRISTMAS EVE

1849

‘Murders in the mining town were not altogether uncommon.’

Burra in 1849 had a population of some 4,000 and was a roaring town of eleven inns with hard drinking bullockies and hard working miners in crude dugout homes in the banks of Burra Creek, of an incredible mixture of wild Irish teamsters, of hard drinking and hard fighting Cornishmen, tough Welsh and German smelters and an even more incredible mixture of the dialects from every part of Wales, Scotland and Cornwall according to a visitor of 1849.  Christmas Eve was traditionally a time for letting off steam in the mining town.  Christmas Eve was one of the few holidays granted by SAMA.  Bare-fisted fights and traditional Cornish wrestling matches took place each year, generally behind the one-storied Miners’ Arms Hotel (now the Burra Hotel in Market Square).  Sometimes as many as 500 miners came to watch the action.  Fights would be coming off all the afternoon and evening, a ring formed and kept by three policemen, powerless to do anything but watch for fair play.  There was no 6 o’clock closing and often no Sunday closing.  It is no wonder the gaol behind the Redruth Police Station had to be enlarged and a new one built in 1856.  Violence was always possible on such occasions and on Christmas Eve 1849 it led to murder.

Mr W. (Bill) R. Marchant, son of the late Jack Marchant of Hanson, returned recently to Burra and visited the cemetery.  He was following up a hunch that his great-uncle Mr T.B. Marchant aged 33 of Mannanarie, who was killed in a fall from a horse in 1854, while riding from Mannanarie to Burra, might be buried in the Burra Cemetery.  He found the grave and headstone of his great-uncle and noted that unusually for a headstone the name was preceded by ‘Mr’.  He also noticed the John Smith headstone and decided to look up the story.

The SA Government Gazette of January 1850 records that a murder lately occurred at Kooringa, committed by a German named Gottlieb Kiernall.  The deceased was a runaway sailor from the Macedon and he came to the German’s house and asked for a light for his pipe.  A lighted candle was handed to him, but being intoxicated he let it fall and it went out.  He insisted on another light, which was refused and the door closed.  He forced it open using threatening language to the German, who then threw a stool at him and then several items were thrown by both sides.  The German then suddenly picked up an axe and struck Smith on the head and repeated the blow, killing Smith almost instantly.  The case was investigated by Mr Lane, who committed Kiernall for trial.

This was held in Adelaide 1 March 1850.

The SA Register newspaper reported that the judge in summing up said it was a sad case and the jury would have to consider what motive the prisoner had.  There appeared to be great provocation.  The deceased had thrown stones and threatened or attempted to set fire to the prisoner’s home.  The jury had to consider how far the provocation reduced the sentence.  After twenty minutes the jury returned a verdict of manslaughter.  The judge agreed with the verdict and sentenced Kiernall to be transported beyond the seas for seven years.  This meant to be sent to the Penal Settlement in Tasmania.

Thefts.  Two young men working in the Burra area have been charged with a number of ‘breaking’ offences and with the theft of various items from the properties concerned.  It is understood a quantity of stolen property has been recovered.  The men have been remanded to Adelaide.

Theft.  On 9 March 1963 Burra Dry Cleaners were broken into and a cash box among other things was stolen.  Now, when the garden block of the late Luke Day was being levelled, the box has been discovered.  It contained various papers and the war service medals of Mr Williams, but not the £7 in silver it had originally held.  Also in the box was a silver medallion inscribed ‘Best Player in Star Football Club 21/9/09’ on one side and the initials L.H. on the other.  It was probably removed from clothing left for dry cleaning and placed in the box for safe keeping.

Polio.  The Health Department has announced a changeover from Salk Vaccine to Sabin (oral) Vaccine for polio from 1 July.

Katie Treweeke, daughter of Mr & Mrs F.H. Treweeke of Petherton, Mt Bryan, is the local entrant in the SA section of the Miss Australia Quest.  A chief source of funding raised will be the Miss Australia Ball at Mt Bryan Hall on 7 July.  Proceeds aid the Woodville Spastic Centre.  Katie is 18 and is closely connecte4d with the Burra & District Branch of the Young Liberals.  She has aims of becoming a psychologist or a librarian and hopes to go to university next year to begin an Arts degree.

Weather.  On Tuesday a severe thunderstorm brought two inches and more of rain and hail in a short time to an area east of Burra.  The area was north of the west end of Princess Royal and the massive run-off went east rather than towards Burra.  Mr George Woodman said that for the short time it took to fall the whole side of the range looked like a moving mass of water.  At Klaebe’s Creek near Studholme a wall of water at least four feet high crossed the spillway.  At Pine Creek crossing where 5 ft pipes have recently been installed the flow was 2 ft above the roadway.  A vast sheet of water and hailstones swept across the road at the four mile corner and through the property of Mrs J. Rooke.  Deep Creek and the Baldina Crossing were flooded when water from Mullaby area cascaded down.  At Mrs V. Bruce’s ‘Armonda’ Mr R. Alderson reported a fall of 140 points in less than 50 minutes.  Roof guttering could not cope and very little of it went into tanks.  He reports a lot of fencing is down and a lot of rubbish and old tyres etc. deposited by the receding water.  The property gained a lot of silt.  During the height of the flooding the Morgan and Eastern Roads were cut and the school bus and other vehicles were held up for some time.  All dams in the area were filled and several burst, causing a further rush of muddy liquid.  At one stage along the main road hail was stacked up two feet high against the netting fence.

Princess Royal recorded 80 points, Mrs J. Rooke 104, Armonda 140, Baldina 70, Mongolata 17 and J. Oates 7.

West of Burra there were isolated heavy falls.  J. Lockett at Springbank gauged 112 and Old Koonoona 53, but Burra recorded a mere 9 points.

Mr R.J. Noye of Saddleworth writes an article on the rise and fall of the Apoinga Smelters.

A small piece of cast iron handed in to Saddleworth District Historical Society has proved to be one of the few remaining links with this pioneer local industry.  It is part of an ingot mould from the Apoinga Smelter, which flourished and then died over 100 years ago.

After the discovery of copper at Burra in 1845 a never ending stream of laden bullock drays wound its way to Port Adelaide.  At the wharves it was auctioned and most was purchased by the Swansea (England) [sic] Smelters.  With little or no competition the mines were not receiving a fair price for their ore.  The SA smelter was to be one of the answers to this lack of competition.  The first smelting attempt at Burra failed miserably and some years passed before the town had its own efficient works.  Meanwhile some South Australians with overseas experience and their own patented copper refining process were attracted to the dense forest of peppermint gums then at Tothill’s Scrub about 20 miles south of Burra.  This was an ideal fuel for their smelting furnaces, which at their peak used 150 loads of wood a week.  These men, Penny and Owen, began planning as early as 1847 and in June 1848 they were ready for building to commence and drays carrying fire bricks, clay and ironwork left Adelaide for Tothill’s Scrub.  Batches of Burra ore were bought and in January 1849 the furnaces produced their first batch of molten copper.  The single stage process was claimed to produce copper as tough and fine as any made overseas using up to seven processes.  Later that year works at Burra and Yatala near Pt Adelaide came into production.  Initial difficulties were overcome and by March 1849 a ton of copper per day was being produced.

This was increased to 50 tons per week by 1851. By then the works supported a village of 100 people living in c. 30 houses with a post office, hotel, blacksmith, shoemaker and general store.  Apoinga seemed set for a rosy future.  The discovery of gold in Victoria dealt a staggering blow.  Almost every able man rushed to Victoria to make (as he thought) his fortune.  Production at Burra fell and the Burra Smelter closed down.  The reduced production was sufficient to keep Apoinga going.  Penny’s men wanted to leave, but they were under contract and he held them to it.  They dealt with this very effectively.  When the slag was drawn off they ensured a generous amount of good copper went with it.  Expenses thus remained high, but production of copper fell.  The works were forced to close and the men rushed to the gold fields.  Some years later when the works were re-opened for a short period a huge lump of solid copper was found at the bottom of the furnace and it took eighteen bullocks to drag it out.

Today sheep graze over the site and all that remains is the slag heap and a scattering of firebricks, still bearing the imprint of a long forgotten brick maker called Ramsay.  The ranges to the east and west are still heavily timbered.  The only remaining building in the village is the hotel, fairly sound considering its age.  Today it is empty.  A few more years will see the last remnants of the Apoinga post office’s mud walls dissolved away.  More permanent are twisted jagged lumps of slag to remind us of a remarkable, but shot-lived era of colonial enterprise.

More could be told of Mr Penny and his fear of escaped convicts and his petition for police protection and the challenge to his patent by the mighty Patent Smelting Co.

Weather

Hailstones from the storm a fortnight ago were still intact after fourteen days.  Large volumes of hailstones washed up against fences and collected in watercourses.  The survival of the hail was first noticed by Messrs Richard Riggs and Brian Woodman when repairing sections of damaged fencing on the property of B.A. Riggs at the end of last week; some 8-10 days after the storm.  Some hail remained where it had been washed along the fencing with silt.  The main area, however, still to be seen, is around the edge of a dam on P.J. Thomas’s property adjoining that of Mr Riggs.  During the week a large tin of hail was brought in by Bruce Woodman and many people observed its contents at the Record office.  Mr Riggs also had a container of them till Monday.  Inspection yesterday at 1.30 p.m. found quite a large mass of the hailstones still present at the water’s edge.  Though the top was covered by a slight layer of silt, the whole mass is fully exposed to the weather and a handful of singular crystal ice particles was easily obtained.  A phone call to the Bureau of Meteorology confirmed that this was an uncommon event and the temperature would have to be constantly 40°F or below for them to have survived for so long.  Also in the debris from the flood Messrs Riggs & Woodman found a large number of frogs, toads and small snakes up to two feet long.  The hailstones look like being there for some time yet.

M.E. & E.M. Mitchell’s clearing sale on23 June was a great success with a total clearance of all machinery and furniture.

Burra Burra Show Inc.  With the resignation of A.R. Graham as Secretary, Julie Sara has been appointed to fill the position.

Burra Rural Youth held a progressive tea and navigational trial on 19 June.  Soup was at Mr Neil’s cheerful kitchen (near Farrell Flat), then the participants moves on to Mr & Mrs [illegible] and Mr & Mrs Nicholls at Blink Bonnie with sweets at Mr & Mrs Kitch Miller’s at Hallett.  Dennis Miller and crew in a Falcon were declared winners.

Telephone Services will improve with two additional trunk line channels between Burra & Booborowie from 30 June 1967.

Burra National Trust will host visitors from the Adelaide Branch at the weekend.  The visitors will tour Burra’s historic places and be entertained at a buffet tea on Saturday evening (courtesy of the CWA).  Work has started on repairs to the back rooms of the Museum and it is hoped these will be ready and in use before the visitors arrive.  From February to mid-May 400 persons signed the visitors’ book and besides these there are many who did not sign.  Mr Bayfield of Spalding has completed repairs to the pack saddles and the camel saddle given to the Branch.

Mr Alec Ford has donated the pay table from the Burra Mine to the Trust.  It is long and narrow and contains approximately ten drawers.  It is some 120 years old and is being reconditioned for use by the branch.

Rural Youth held a Merino Stud Tour in the Clare-Burra-Mt Bryan-Hallett districts for two days from 20 June.

Burra Creek area from the Red Bridge to the old swing bridge site is being cleaned up using District Council plant.

Mrs M.E. Mitchell was given a farewell by Burra Bowling Associates on Tuesday evening.  She was a founding member and has three times been club champion.

CWA Burra Branch AGM is reported from 16 June.  Thirty members attended.  President Mrs E.T. Baulderstone reported on a successful year. [Secretary Jennifer Ford’s report is printed in just under 1 column of detail.]

Average attendance was 25.

Highlight of the year was the birthday party with the State President Mrs Zerbe as guest speaker.

The Warnes Group Conference was held at Burra this year in April with members from 16 branches present.  The CWA did not cater this year for the Burra Races and fund raising efforts were a street stall, an apron afternoon, an oil heating demonstration and the monthly trading table.

During the year a plaque was put on the Mrs A.L. Kellock memorial gate.  (She was a foundation member.)

The appearance of the rest room has been enhanced by the gravel surrounds (given and spread by R.W. Humphrys) and the gay kitchen curtains made and hung by Mrs S. Scroop.  Mrs A.B. Riggs has maintained the UK links.  Mrs A. Phillips aided by Mrs Gallagher has continued the weekly hospital visits.

Elected were: President, Mrs E.T. Baulderstone; Vice-Presidents, Mrs H. Jennison and one yet to be elected; Secretary, Mrs R. Jeffery and Treasurer, Mrs H. Crump.

Burra Bowling Club held its AGM on 5 July with C.L. Phillips in the chair.

Elected: Patron, D. Jacka; President, C.L. Phillips; Vice-Presidents, M. Stockman & C. Dare; Secretary, D. Field continues pro tem and Treasurer, H. Crump.

The club resolved to forward to the MNBA a notice of motion seeking the Association be divided into a First and Second Division and that the Association lay down conditions of play for the Champion of Champion rinks and singles events.  Congratulations were extended to Stan Woollacott for winning the veterans’ event, which had not been finalised on closing day.  The President reported that most clubs seemed dissatisfied with the arrangements for a minor round with play-offs through semi-finals, finals and a grand-final for the pennant competition and changes are desirable for the 1967-68 season.  Burra Blue reached the semi-finals.  The greens were first class this year, especially later in the season.  Thanks go to Dudley Jacka for this and to Charlie Dare for looking after watering, assisted by Joe Lloyd and also to Joe Lloyd, Bill Corner and Merv Burt for cutting and rolling.  Club tournaments seem to start too late and this causes a rush to finish them before the season closes.  An earlier start seems desirable.  Valued members who have left the district are Alex Ford and Milton Mitchell and Bill Teague is also moving on.

He had previously won it in 1935 and until 1967 the race had never been won twice by the same rider.  The route started in Burra, went five miles towards Mt Bryan and returned via Burra and the Main Adelaide Road to Elizabeth and on to the finish at Modbury via Golden Grove Road.  Riders faced a fierce head wind for much of the way.  Results:

K. Thurgood (14 minutes)

I. Hennig (14 minutes)

The fastest time was by K. Smoker of Whyalla in 4 hours 18 minutes and he was also the first country rider to finish.

Lutheran Church.  The amalgamation of the United Evangelical Lutheran Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church became effective on 1 January 1967.  Parishes have been re-aligned and congregations united where both churches existed in the same town.  An amalgamation took place between Clare and Blyth.  As a result a number of churches were closed.  In SA fifteen closed in January.  Some of the closed churches became halls, some were sold to other denominations and some that were moveable were transferred to areas where no Lutheran congregations existed.  Yesterday morning a timber-framed asbestos church 44 ft by 18 ft plus the front porch was moved by Low Loaders Ltd from Hansen [sic] Road Woodville Gardens to Burra.  It arrived in good shape and was positioned on a block of land on the corner of Morehead Street and the road leading to the old Reformatory.  [Actually the corner of Ludgvan and Tregony Streets.]  Two men managed to unload and set the building in position in four hours.  Furnishings had already been redistributed, so the Burra congregation is seeking necessary items from other closed churches and some fine donations have already been received.  The Burra congregation numbers only about twenty at present and is part of the Clare-Blyth Parish served by Pastor H.H. Schmidt of Blyth.  Services are held fortnightly and up ti now have been in St Mary’s Parish Hall.  The new building should be ready for use in about eight weeks.

Rev. P.N. Potter, President of the Methodist Conference of SA, visited Burra last Wednesday.  160 guests welcomed him and his wife at the Redruth Hall where he met the Chairman of the Middle District, Rev. W. Stafford & Mrs Stafford.  Also in the official party were Rev. & Mrs Lind, Mr & Mrs B.P. Thamm and Mr R.M. Farrow who acted as MC.  Mr Thamm as Senior Circuit Steward welcomed the guests and the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone also extended a welcome on behalf of the Town Council.  Rev. Stafford briefly explained the workings of the Middle District and Rev. Potter gave an address.  He had been stationed in Burra some 26 years ago.  Rev. Potter’s address was on Church Union.  It is hoped a Union of Presbyterian, Congregational and Methodist Churches will be finalised by 1971.  There are about 24 united parishes at present.  He also spoke on the need to adapt forms of worship for the young and for some new twentieth century hymns.

Burra History: According to a ‘women’s weekly paper’ of 14 June 1967 in an article by Bill Beatty.

In 1845 when the colony was only seven years old and on the verge of ruin a child gathering wildflowers brought news of a patch of pretty blue ground in a valley called Burra Burra, near where she lived.  Her father investigated and found traces of copper, then worth a king’s ransom. Miners were brought from Wales, Spaniards and mules from South America and for the next twenty years 1,000 men were employed on a twenty-four hour shift that yielded copper worth millions of dollars.  Today they are a memory and the Burra is a centre of a farming and pastoral area.

Ian Auhl writes commenting on the article.

While it is true that the Burra Mine did save the young colony from ruin, the other aspects of the above article are wrong.  The colony was nine years old not seven.  The mine opened on 29 September 1845 with the firing of the first blast and closed on 29 September 1877 with the dismissal, with a day’s notice, of 360 men employed.  The mine thus had a life of 32 years rather than 20.  Miners came largely from Cornwall rather than Wales, though Welshmen came later to work in the smelting works of the English & Australian Copper Co.  The story of the discovery seems to have been confused with that of the Kapunda Mine three years before.  Copper was discovered at Burra by the shepherds Streair and Pickett.  Streair was working for James Stein who held a pastoral lease along the creek when he found copper near the southern boundary of what is now Section 2 of the Hundred of Kooringa.  He kept quiet about it and in June 1845 tried to sell his secret in Adelaide.  An Adelaide mining syndicate refused to give him £6 for it.  He went to the Rundle Street shop of Bunce & Thomson, where he sold the information to Bunce for £8. Streair then fades out of the story.  A company formed under George Kingston (later Sir George) went to investigate the claim and while there heard of another discovery further up the Burra Creek by a shepherd called Thomas Pickett who worked for William Robinson on his ‘Gum Creek’ lease.  Pickett had a hut near a spring on Diprose Creek and its ruins are still to be seen on the north bank a little east of the junction of the roads from Kooringa and Aberdeen to Morgan.  Neither of the shepherds was married or had wildflower-picking children.  Pickett was driving to his hut with provisions from Gum Creek when his wagon wheel broke off a rock to reveal the ‘blue ground’.  The discovery soon became widely known and the difficulty then was to find the £20,000 in SA that was needed to purchase the 20,000 acre special survey.  Governor grey insisted on payment in gold sovereigns.  Neither of the rival companies in SA could raise this much and to forestall a Sydney company waiting in the wings, they united to get the survey.  Once the survey was made though, instead of combining, they drew lots to see who should have Streair’s find and who should have Pickett’s discovery.  In the long run the SA Mining Association obtained Pickett’s discovery and made £5,000,000.  The rival Princess Royal Mining Co. got Streair’s find and lost £5,000.  Streair made £8, which in the final analysis was not a bad result for a failed mine.  Pickett received a bonus from the SA Mining Association of £1 per week for life.  He continued as a shepherd on Gum Creek Run about eight miles north of the mine and a few years later was burnt to death.  He was buried at Kooringa, probably in the old cemetery across the creek from the present Burra Cemetery.  Perhaps the names of the shepherds will live on and Burra like Kalgoorlie with, Paddy Hannan, will have a statue to its discoverer.  When the mine was a success Pickett was sent for and asked what he desired as a reward and it was his choice to opt for £1 a week and a team of bullocks.  He ended tragically.  After buying a small keg of rum he went off in his dray and the next morning some drovers found the burnt fragments of the vehicle, the iron hoops of the keg and beneath it the charred remains of the old shepherd.

Redruth Gaol

The Burra Town Council has received a grant of $475 from the Government for the preservation of Redruth Gaol.  After a meeting between representatives of the Council and the National Trust it was decided to remove boxthorns and the present fences and then to re-fence the area granted to the Council, to renovate the façade and to give the building a facelift inside and out and to build an access ramp to the property.  The Tourist Bureau believes Burra has sufficient buildings to make it a first class tourist attraction.  Tours to Burra will be the next step to be organised.  The Corporation and the National Trust consider these moves are in the best interests of the town and deserve general support.

Redruth Gaol and Reformatory: Some Historical Notes by Ian Auhl.

The Gaol is important because it was the first to be erected in a country area.  This was because in the 1840s there were no other country towns of any size in SA.  The population of the Mine area rose to 5,000 between 1845 and 1850.  The population of Adelaide at the time was not much more than 20,000.  Redruth Police Station was erected in the late 1840s in the Government Town of Redruth, rather than in the SA Mining Association town of Kooringa.  A temporary gaol was built on the police block with stables for the police mounts and an exercise yard and cells.  This building still stands with a shingle roof, covered now with iron.  The new official gaol was built in 1856 at a cost of c. £3,800.  It included a residence for the Gaoler and two Turnkeys, with a kitchen, wash-house and storeroom.  There were three sells for males and three for females.  The cells were ceiled with four inch gum planks to prevent escapes.  The first Gaoler was Mr T. Perry (his wife was Annie).  (The present Tom and Anne Perry disclaim any relationship.)  The Gaol became known as Perry’s Hotel and this term was even used in the Law Court reports.  Mr Perry was keeper 1856-79 and he and his wife are buried in the Burra Cemetery.  Messrs Pollitt & Young were Gaol Keepers 1880-84 and Mr Criddle took over from 1885 till closure in 1894.  In 1858 Mr Perry complained that the Gaol was overcrowded with ‘prisoners and lunatics’.  Gaol sentences were handed out for offences that now would warrant only a fine and the court was always crowded to hear the details of the more horrible or salacious offences.  Court reports of the day were detailed and left nothing to the imaginations.  Today such reporting would bring action for libel.  When the Gaol closed in 1894 there were suggestions it could be used as an abattoirs and a freezing works.  For a few years it was occupied by the Woollacott family and Mr Stan Woollacott was born in it.  In 1897 it was renovated and became a Girls’ Reformatory.  The girls arrived in December 1897.  There was fist, second and third class accommodation.  The more incorrigible girls were sent from Adelaide.  About 30 girls were house, some as young as 15.  They worked in the garden, laundry, kitchen, rooms and the wood heap.  From time to time there were escapes.  The first matron was Mrs Holden and there was a sib-matron and a wards woman.  The cost was recorded as 17/5⅜ per girl per week.  The place was grim and forbidding as is its story.

Burra Hospital AGM

Chairman Mr R.K. Pearse reported that the general layout of phase three of the building project had been approved and tenders will be called soon for submission to the Chief Secretary.  Phase 3 of the original plan is expected to cost up to $100,000.  At present hospital funds are in credit $24,000.  Phase 2, the middle section of the building, was completed at a cost of $14,000 from the hospital’s own resources, as were the complete exterior repainting and repairs at a cost of $9,000.

Mr Baulderstone congratulated the Chairman and the Board on the improvements made over the last four years.

The Chairman reported a sound financial position.  The overdraft had been reduced by $2,142 to $5,991 and there is an overall credit balance of $24,114.

Repairs and replacements have risen by $6,743.

Patient fees have risen by $4,647 and Government subsidy and Council contributions are up by $1,304.

The daily average of Inpatients increased by 0.3 to 16.3.

This has helped keep average costs under control.

The collection of patient fees is 98%.

Births fell by 7 to 43.

[He then lists a number of items bought to improve the hospital’s equipment.]

A major program of maintenance cost $9,000.  [This is then detailed.]

The third phase is the building on the old Burra Hotel site of the theatre and casualty wing and turning the old theatre block into domestic quarters and a sewing room.  The Mining Company has been consulted before drawing up these plans.  When the new Theatre Wing – ‘which I recommend to the incoming Board be known as the Alice Collins Wing’ – is completed, we will have a most up-to-date hospital.  We must acknowledge the great help in planning given by the Director General of Medical Services, Dr Rollison and architects Stapleton, McMichael and Loveday.

In the cropping program this year there is only about 30 acres under crop, thanks to Don Stockman and land leased from the Burra Council.  Mr Tom Rogers has sown 50 acres of Hanson Reserve to clover.  Last year we received $1,416 from wheat sales.

The Auxiliary remains active and the maintenance of the linen and the stocking of shelves with preserves and jams owes much to them.

The Burra & District Fund Raising Committee raised $850 this year.

The high standard of service and efficiency has been maintained by Matron Fyfe, ably assisted by Sister Taylor and on a part-time basis by Sisters Leedham and Byles.

The trainee nurses have done their jobs well and the cleanliness of the buildings inside and outside is a credit to the domestic staff.

The financial stability of the Hospital has been strengthened by the work of our Secretary-Manager Mr L.H. Packer.

National Trust.  The visitors from the city had a very interesting weekend as guests of the Burra Branch.  When they arrived in two buses at 12.30 on Saturday they were given a tour by Messrs Auhl and Woollacott.  Mrs A.D. Radford showed them around the Museum.  The tour covered the town and took them out to Breakneck and Moonlight Hills to give them some idea of the eastern plains and the Murray Scrub.  A special display was arranged at the Museum of maps, old newspapers and other items of interest.  Burra CWA prepared a buffet style evening meal at the RSL Hall.  Mr S.J. Woollacott welcomed the guests as President of Burra & District National Trust.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone welcomed the visitors on behalf of residents and spoke of the role of the Town Council in the preservation of the mine precincts and he predicted a great future for the tourist industry.  Mr Ian Auhl was guest speaker for the evening.  Films taken by Mr John Kingsford –Smith some months ago at Burra were shown.  On Sunday morning a visit was made to the Brewery Cellars and some of the group attended the 9.30 a.m. service at St Mary’s, having been shown through it by Rev. Sibly the previous day.  Adelaide and Waikerie members of the National Trust gathered with Burra members at Princess Royal at 11 a.m.  Misses Josephine Morphett and Alison Wood conducted visitors through the ground floor of the stately home and the garden was enjoyed by all.  After lunch at their respective hotels the guests departed for Adelaide at 2 p.m.  Waikerie visitors were shown over the town in the afternoon.

Ten O’clock Closing of Hotels was introduced on 28 September, bringing to an end the 6 p.m. closing introduced in 1916.  The change was greeted quietly at Burra where hotel proprietors report only a slight increase in sales in the few days since the change.  Normal day trade seems not to have been affected.  On Thursday night the drinking population appeared to go from one hotel to another and a few curious non-drinkers looked in for the occasion.  Friday and Saturday nights are expected to be the busiest when things settle down.

The Burra Show will be held next Saturday.  There are record entries in several sections.  It will be opened by Hon. C.R. Kelly MHR at 12.45 p.m.

Burra Effluent Drainage Scheme

At a meeting in the Town Hall on 2 October Health Department officers gave an illustrated account of a drainage scheme to dispose of waste water.  Messrs Wilson & Smith were representatives at the well-attended meeting.  The first such scheme had been a success at Pinnaroo, after which they had been installed at places like Berri, Maitland, Nuriootpa and Barmera.  There are thirty more towns at present ready to go ahead with schemes.  Rates applicable to cover the original cost are less than the Government sewerage rate.  Costs vary from town to town due to varying soils, underground water, rock types, etc.  The Central Board of Health will design a scheme; prepare plans, specifications and estimates at no cost to the Council or ratepayers.  For Burra they have prepared a scheme designed to cover the business area from the old Post Office to the Hospital, with a capacity for fifty homes or buildings on the south side of Commercial Street.  The drain would run from the treatment area at the rear of the Bowling Green, up the lane behind the Post Office, through the lane by the Police Station to Chapel Street, along behind the Commercial Hotel and Hurley’s Road House to Kangaroo Street to the Hospital septic system on the north side of Commercial Street.  A connection from Chapel Street to the front of Bence’s premises would then run as far as Dr Miller’s in one direction and to the old Post Office in the other.  The treatment portion near the Bowling Green would comprise a biological filter and pond.  There would be no odour from the pond.  There are already two small biological filters in Burra; one on the creek side of the old Post Office and the other near the Red Bridge behind the Burra Motor Co.’s premises.  The stone in the filters lasted a long time – one at Glenelg had not been renewed in 30 years.  Mr Topsfield asked about the possibility of a double pond system to take raw sewage.  Mr Wilson said this was not recommended because it would cost three times as much.  In the unit under consideration it would be necessary to have septic treatment on the individual properties before connection to the main drainage.  It could handle laundry, kitchen and ordinary waste water without prior treatment – but would not handle storm water.  The cost was estimated at $12,000.  This would be a cost of $200 per premises for the initial scheme, which could be extended to the rest of the town later.  It was intended to site the drain under the footpaths.  Council would have to repair or replace the footpaths involved.  It would generally be about four feet from foundations and about four feet deep.

Mr Jacka moved a recommendation the system be enlarged for the whole town and the original treatment tank site be used as a pumping point with a larger oxidation pond further down the creek.  Seconded by Mr Topsfield.  It was pointed out that the extra surveys etc. would delay the scheme by three or four years.  The recommendation was withdrawn on the request of the Chairman E.T. Baulderstone and replaced by a suggestion that the proposed limited scheme be implemented, but the disposal unit be further downstream with a pump behind the Burra Bowling Green and the oxidation pond be large enough to take on the whole town drainage at a later time.  On E.T. Baulderstone’s request this was also withdrawn in the interests of not delaying the project.  After discussion L. Bence moved a recommendation be made to the Local Board of Health that the scheme as presented be adopted subject to the Central Board investigating the possibility of installing a pump in lieu of the biological filter and determining the availability of land at reasonable cost to install an oxidation pond which would eventually take the effluent from the whole town.  This was seconded by Dr Miller.

[Presumably this was carried, though it is not so reported.]

Burra Mine

The Minister’s reply to a question in Parliament.

Drilling operations by the Department of Mines and the ‘present company’ have not been encouraging.  Drilling has proved difficult because the porous nature of the ground has made it hard to keep water on the drill.  Both the company and the Mines Department drillers have found this a difficulty, which has threatened the diamond drills when they run hot.  At present only one drill is operating to test deeper possibilities.  Results so far have not been encouraging.  Several million tons of low grade copper have been indicated in the oxidised ‘leavings’ and a feasibility study into the commercial possibilities of treating this is expected to be completed soon.

Accident/Obituary.  Two elderly Mt Bryan East residents were killed instantly on Friday at about 2.30 p.m. some four miles north of Mt Bryan when their car collided with a truck laden with sheep skins.  The truck was driven by P.G. Dunn of Kilburn and was travelling south.  The small sedan was travelling west from the Mt Bryan East road to join the main road.  Mr Arthur E. Goodridge (67) a retired labourer was driving the sedan, which was practically destroyed on impact.  The driver and passenger, Mary Olive Jean McKay (53), also of Mt Bryan East, were both thrown from the car and are believed to have died instantly.  The truck driver swerved right to try to avoid the impact, but the truck rolled over completely after the collision and ended back on its wheels, facing west and blocking the roadway.  The driver and six-year-old passenger in the truck seem to have been saved from being crushed by the high load of skins.  The young boy received some lacerations and stayed in Burra Hospital overnight for observation.

[Arthur Emmanuel Goodridge born 14 June 1900 Booborowie: died 13 October 1967 near Mt Bryan, residence Mount Bryan East.  Mary Olive Jean McKay born 26 February 1914 Loxton: died 13 October 1967 near Mt Bryan, residence Mount Bryan East.]

The Zone 36 Open Day on 6 June was enjoyable, though with not as many entries as hoped for.  A profit of $33 resulted.  Our own open day 29 June also saw a pleasing profit of $58.  Congratulations are extended to Club Champion Mrs Nicholls, ‘B’ Grade Champion Mrs Wuttke and ‘C’ Grade Champion Miss Lines.  Two thefts during the year of items accumulated over the years were disappointing, but these have been replaced and members reimbursed from the insurance company.  An electric stove and twelve new chairs have been added.  Elected were: President, Mrs M. Nicholls; Vice-Presidents, Mesdames R. Wuttke & E. Jeffery; Captain Mrs D. Field; Vice-Captain, Mrs L. Braendler; Treasurer, Mrs H. Crump & Secretary, Mrs F.H. Reed.

Burra Hospital.  A start will soon be made on Phase 3 of the building plan and the Board is this week launching an appeal for funds.  In this phase a new operating theatre and facilities, casualty room and domestic quarters will replace the old theatre block and old hotel section of the building.  The Government has approved the plan and will, as in the past, offer a subsidy on a two for one basis and donations are tax deductible.  The approximate cost of the alterations will be $100,000.  Funds already held by the Hospital are insufficient to enable completion so an appeal is being made for $25,000.  Donations are acknowledged for $2,117.

Burra Races on Saturday proved more successful than in 1966.  Gate takings were up $70.  The weather was ideal and there were some exciting finishes.  CWA ladies provided lunch and afternoon teas.  [Results are printed.]

Burra Primary School.   Headmaster Mr Ian Auhl, has been transferred for next year to Para Hills west Primary & Infant School.  Mr Auhl has been a man most concerned with the welfare of the children in his charge.  His replacement will be Miss Marlene Spratt who has been Deputy Headmistress of Northfield Primary School for the past four years.  She is something of a pioneer, being the youngest of three women who have been appointed to head larger State Primary Schools.  Another change at the school sees Miss Meredith Satchell transferred and she will be replaced by Mrs Carpenter.  Mrs Carpenter regrets having to leave the Kindergarten, which she has pioneered through its teething troubles.

Adelaide Wools Sales17-19 October saw Willogoleche top district prices at 565/6c. with Princess Royal at 56½c. and Gum Creek at 56c.  [Other local district prices are printed.]

Burra Lutheran Church will be dedicated on 5 November.  It was transported on 18 August from Mansfield Park and has since been renovated and refitted.  There will be a special service at 2.30 p.m. conducted by Rev. G.O. Minge, President of the Lutheran Church of Australia, SA District, assisted by Rev. A.E. Thiele of Saddleworth, a former Pastor of the Burra Congregation and Rev. A.H. Schmidt, the present pastor.  Members have spent many hours setting up the church.  The porch had been removed for transportation and was rebuilt.  The whole building was repainted.  Fittings for the interior have come from other congregations.

The Clare Congregation presented furniture for the sanctuary, of the altar, pulpit, font and an organ.

The Blyth Congregation provided the sanctuary carpet, the aisle runner and the notice board.

Both these congregations are in the same parish as Burra.

The Palmer Congregation gave the pews.  These were old and had to be shortened, but are quite comfortable. Seating is provided for more than 80 people.

Robertstown Church donated a fine set of paraments [robes] in the five different colours and a clergy chair.

The history of the Lutheran Church in Burra goes back to 1847 when the mining company brought out a group of smelters from the Hanz mountains [sic: for Harz] in Germany.  These and other Germans, who hoped to make their fortunes in copper mining, formed a congregation in 1851 and built [actually began to build] a church near the courthouse.  Many of them left, however, in 1852 for the Victorian gold rush.  A struggling congregation remained for a number of years.  Later the church was rented to a Lodge and was destroyed by fire after one of their meetings on 20 July 1910.  [This is an inadequate and misleading summary of the history of the building, which was actually completed only in 1861.  It continued to have Lutheran services from visiting pastors as well as being used as the Wesleyan Sunday school for over twenty years, by the Aberdeen Oddfellows’ Lodge and as a general meeting place.]  The records show that from 1905 Lutherans living in Burra were served by different pastors.  Services were generally conducted in homes of members of the congregation and alternated between Booborowie and Mt Bryan.  Later services were commenced at Flagstaff.  In 1939 services were conducted at Burra when the congregation rented the old Copperhouse Methodist Church.  [Actually the Westbury Methodist Church.]  Then at the end of 1940 it moved to the old Westbury Church in Burra, where it worshipped till the building became unsafe.  [This is incorrect.  The church used in Burra North was Jubilee Hall, the former Primitive Methodist Chapel and later the Methodist Sunday school.  But the dates are also incorrect.]  The congregation then transferred to St Mary’s [Anglican] Parish Hall where the last service was held on 22 October.  The present minister is Pastor A.H. Schmidt who lives at Blyth.  It is planned to hold services fortnightly with lay readers on alternate weeks.  Chairman of the Congregation is Mr Edgar Pietsch and the secretary/Treasurer is Rupert Kleinig.

[A photograph of the church before it was moved from Mansfield Park is printed.]

[This account is rather inaccurate.  After the 1910 fire the places for services were:

1911-1921	Jubilee Hall, Burra North, formerly the Primitive Methodist Zion Chapel.

1922-27	At private homes at Mt Bryan & Booborowie

1927-34	At private homes at Mt Bryan & Flagstaff

1934-39	At a private home at Flagstaff

1939	From August 1939 to 1947 at the former Westbury Methodist Church (adjacent to Copperhouse).  The church actually in Copperhouse was a Primitive Methodist Church, which had become the Copperhouse School.

1947-57	The Oddfellows’ Lodge Hall at Burra North.

1957-67	St Mary’s Anglican Parish Hall

Please refer to the book History of the Lutheran Church in Burra 1851-2007, compiled by Ron Smedley, Barb. Secomb & Jack Kleinig and published in 2007 to mark the 40th anniversary of St John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Burra, for a more reliable account of the history of the Burra Lutheran Congregation.]

Obituary.  Mr Horton Joseph Barraclough Jennison

Mr H.J.B. Jennison died at Burra Hospital on 8 October at the age of 69.  He was one of the town’s best known and most respected businessmen, citizens and philanthropists.  He first came to Burra in 1914 when his father was appointed minister of the Redruth Methodist Circuit.  Later he married Miss Reta Thomas, daughter of Mr & Mrs H.H. Thomas of Aberdeen.  Mr Ray Jennison of Burra is a son and two daughters, Barbara and Josephine are married and living in Melbourne.  Another daughter, June, is deceased.  Mr Jennison established the firm of Jennison’s Tyre Service in Commercial Street and was an active partner in the firm up to the time of his death.  Mr Jennison loved his family, his town, his country, his church and his fellow men.  For two years in the 1940s he was Mayor of Burra.  He was always dignified, loyal and eloquent, making him a capable Mayor whose service will not be forgotten.  He was one of the forces behind the establishment of the Mar Memorial improvement Committee and rendered valuable service as a Justice of the Peace.

Mr Jennison was a volunteer for service in both World Wars.  The continued welfare of ex-servicemen was close to his heart and he was active in the local RSL sub-branch, serving as its President for some time.  He was also most dutiful in attending to the needs and education of Legacy wards.  He gave more than a fair share of his time to local schools.  For many years he was a member of the Primary School Committee and of the High School Council, being Chairman of the latter from 1953-64.  When the present House System was established at the High School in 1961 he consented to have one of the Houses named after him.  One of the last memories many students will have of him will be his presence at their sports day this year, urging on his House.

He was an ardent Lodge man, being a member of several.  He was Right Worshipful Brother in the Grand Mark Lodge and Lodges were well represented at his funeral.  He was a staunch member of the Redruth Methodist Church and since its amalgamation with the Kooringa Circuit, of the new Burra Circuit.  He was a Church steward and Circuit Steward for Redruth 1939-42 and Secretary of the Redruth Trust, which he served for many years, from 1951 till his death.  He was born on the Mission Fields of Fiji and was the local Secretary for Overseas Missions for a long period.  The funeral was held most appropriately at the Redruth Church, which he had loved so well.

Burra Hospital: Work begins on Phase III

Local contractors, Hirschausen Bros., M.G. Wardle and D.T. Jacka & Co., are demolishing the old hotel building.

Mr Ian Auhl has delved into the history of the building.  Ninety years ago on Tuesday 27 February 1877 rain and nature seemed determined to upset the arrangements of humanity.  A half holiday had been declared and the town was looking forward to a day of celebration with ‘a grand blow-out’ to follow and a concert in the new Institute at night.  Eminent visitors arrived by train the night before for the double event of the opening of the Burra Hospital and the laying of the foundation stone of the new Model School. The old Burra Hotel had been acquired from the SA Mining Association ‘on very generous terms’.  It had been renovated and painted and a Wardsman and Matron, Mr Wright Heath and his wife, had been appointed at a combined salary of £100 with rations and accommodation.  The hotel had been erected in 1849, taking the placed of a wooden one on the same site in 1847.  In 1849 it was known as Wren’s Hotel and was the largest in SA.  It was owned by Mr Paxton who also owned, like a good Mine Director, the four inns in Kooringa.  The Burra Burra Hotel was the first encountered on entering the town and was patronised by the ‘quality’ and always used by the Mine Directors on their visits to the Burra Burra Mine.  Attached to it was a very spacious room 50 ft by 30 ft and 15 ft high, which had been more particularly built as a Freemason’s Hall, it being the largest room in the colony.  The spacious cellars held a large supply of wine, liquors and other tavern stores from Burra Directors’ Port to hams, loaf sugar, pewter pots, glass and crockery.  In this hall were held all the public and political meetings of the day and all the major functions of the town.  The hotel with its shingle roof closed as a hotel in the year before it opened as a hospital.  Now ninety years later it is being demolished to make way for a new wing of the hospital and for a few days its shingle roof was again exposed when the iron was removed.  There are few 120-year-old buildings as well preserved as this one.  Its cellars are still there.

The Burra Model School still stands and its foundation stone was laid on the same Tuesday.

After the hospital had been opened by Sir Henry Ayers the party went to the Institute where a procession was formed headed by the Burra Brass Band followed by some twenty Freemasons and then the Oddfellows, Foresters and Rechabites, each in full regalia and then the members of the Ministry present, the Mayor and Corporation and Mr Bath.  The stone was laid on 27 February 1877 by Thomas Bath, the oldest business resident in Burra.  The inhabitants turned out en masse and must have numbered nearly 1,500.  The building was intended to accommodate 800-900 children and was due to be completed by the end of 1877.  The cost was £6,976 including furniture.

During the National Trust weekend visit to Burra recently Mrs Halliday visited Burra and brought with her the silver trowel with which her grandfather, Mr Thomas Bath, had laid the foundation stone.  She has generously presented the trowel to the school and it will be displayed in a place of honour in the Primary School Library.

She has also stated that she might be persuaded to donate the wooden mallet given to her grandfather by the contractors for the building, Messrs Sara & Dunstan.  The mallet is hollow and inside has been stored a copy of the Burra News of 1877, giving an account of the events on that day.  Perhaps on the opening day of the new hospital a thought can be spared for the old Burra Burra Hotel and the hospital building that has now disappeared and also for the silver trowel that brought the story to light again.

Notes:

The old Mining Association Hospital became known as Bleak House.  It has recently been purchased by Mr Johnson Carpenter and is being renovated.  After 1877 it became a private school and was known as the Burra High School.

The present Burra Hotel was earlier called The Miners’ Arms and the name the Burra Hotel was given to it after the old Burra Burra Hotel had become a hospital.

Burra hospital Building Appeal Fund donations have reached $2,454.

The Burra Film recently made by John Kingsford-Smith of Sydney is a five-minute feature and will be shown on 4 December as part of a series of similar features on historic towns and homes of Australia.  The script is by Ian Auhl and the film shows many places of interest in Burra.

Weather.  The dry spell continues.  October rain was only 38 points and the year’s total is only 6.27 inches.  Hot windy conditions have also contributed to deterioration in the country and to crop yields enormously.

Accident.  A car driven by Mr Jack Gordon of Black Springs and formerly of Koo-Owie swerved off the road 1½ miles north of Manoora and rolled over twice, ending back on its wheels.  In the car were Mr & Mrs Gordon, their four children and Mr Gordon Sen.  Remarkably none of them were injured.

Dedication of St John’s Lutheran Church, Burra.

Visitors from other mid-northern Lutheran Congregations combined with members of the Burra congregation, representatives of other denominations and other special guests for the dedication of St John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church at Burra North by Pastor G.O. Minge, President of the SA District of the Lutheran Church of Australia.  Incidentally, his first public sermon was preached on Christmas Day 1922 at Mt Bryan.  The church has seating for 80, or at a pinch 100, and about as many had to remain outside to hear the service over a loud speaker.  Participating in the service was Pastor Thiele of Saddleworth, a former pastor to the Burra congregation and Pastor Schmidt, the present pastor.  Mrs Zweck of Blyth played the organ and the small but effective Blyth Choir led the singing.  Pastor Thiele thanked the Anglicans for the use of their hall in recent years and Rev. Sibly of St Mary’s gave greetings from Anglican parishioners.  Monsignor Hughes spoke on behalf of the Roman Catholics and thanked the congregation for inviting him to be present.  Pastor Schmidt said members of the Burra congregation were overwhelmed by the attendance and that to date the undertaking was debt-free.  He thanked all helpers and donors very sincerely.  Afternoon tea was served in the RSL Hall.  The next service at St John’s will be on 19 November at 9 a.m.   [The photograph of the church before it was moved from Mansfield Park is reprinted.]

Burra Police report quite a few people have taken advantage of an amnesty for unregistered firearms.  Many people think that once a firearm is registered it is for all times, but a change of ownership requires the new owner to register the firearm.

Sgt N. Orford from City Headquarters will replace Sgt W. Teague and he will take up duty in Burra early in the New Year.

Kooringa Methodist Guild Fete was opened by Mrs Lind.  She said this was probably her last official duty before the family transferred to the Yankalilla Circuit early in 1968.  The fete made a profit of $250.  [Details in ¾ column.]

Burra Hospital Building Fund Appeal.  Sufficient funds were raised in 1963 to open the new administration block and private rooms etc. in Phase I of the plan.  Phase II saw the remodelling of the wards, kitchen etc. and this was completed from the Hospital’s own funds.  Phase III has been in the processing stage for some time.

Burra Hospital.  The demolition of the old hotel section is almost complete and excavation work is in progress.  Some 2,000 cubic yards of rubble has been handled.  Excavation work will allow continuation of the one floor level for the new building.  In the last four years district residents have contributed about $16,000 including $11,000 for Phase I.  Subsidised by the Government, this represents a total of roughly $50,000.  Phases I & II of the plan plus maintenance and repairs have amounted to well in excess of $100,000 with the balance coming from Hospital revenue and subsidies.  The complete value of the whole plan will amount to over $200,000.  This means the present donation when subsidised $15,000 will represent one sixth of the second $100,000.

Donations presently stand at $5,263.70.

An apparent fall in water quality has apparently prompted some people to believe that local underground water is being mixed with River Murray water.

A Tale of the Burra Smelters

[Charles Barber Griffiths (a grandson of John Barber Griffiths) was 83 in 1967 and wrote an article concerning an incident at the time of building the stack of the smelters chimney at Burra.]

In 1855-56 John Barber Griffiths came to Australia from Cardiff in Wales.  He was a stone mason who built and maintained furnaces.  He came to Burra as an employee of the English & Scottish Copper Co.

With him were his wife Sarah and son Charles Barber and five daughters: Sarah, Addie, Elizabeth, Prisilla [sic] and Polly.  Two more children, John and Francis, were born in Australia.  Charles Barber had been apprenticed in Wales as a stone mason at the age of 8 and was 12 when he arrived in Burra where he continued as an apprentice with his father.

Before telling of the incident, I would like to say something of the building of the smelting works.  It was a well-built place.  The front was about 200 feet long with one big arch after another and the height of the wall was c. 15 feet.  Inside, down the centre was another row of arches and the back was the same.  Both ends walls were, I think, without openings. The whole building had a big iron gable roof.  The furnaces were built at the back of the arches.  The smoke was taken from the earth furnace into a big tunnel, which ran along the back row of arches and then went underground for c. 20 ft before going up the chimney stack.  The tunnel had smoke boxes off the side of it about the size of a room.  I remember there were two of them.  They used to tell me they were used to stop the smoke from turning round and round and if there was too much smoke all at once it would go back into these boxes.  My father used to tell me about the building of this chimney, which was said to be 100 ft high.  It was c. 12 ft square at the bottom and my father said it was 4 ft 6 inches square at the top.

This is the incident about the building of the chimney.

It was built from the inside with all the scaffolding on the inside of it.  When the masons were building the cap to the top of the stack an inspector came and climbed the scaffolding to near the cap.  The masons were commenting on its great height, but the inspector said ‘You don’t call this stack high do you?’

One of them said it was the highest the inspector was every likely to get off the ground.

‘Tell that to the Marines.’ Said the inspector.

‘Why, I’d jump off this thing any day for a bottle of brandy.’

‘Well, jump,’ said one of the masons ‘and we’ll give you a bottle of brandy, but you had better drink it before you jump, for you will never drink anymore after you do jump.’

He accepted the dare and they accepted his wager.

The next day he returned with an umbrella and climbed to the top of the stack and asked if they had the bottle of brandy.  They said they had.

‘Well, I’m going to jump now; you can come down after me and give it to me then.’

His umbrella had chords attached to the top.  They crossed over the top and then were attached to the handle and he then fastened those chords to his wrist.  He then stepped onto the cap on the northeast corner and jumped off.  He landed on a heap of sand and was not hurt in any way.  He got his bottle of brandy.

My father said they all needed a bottle of brandy when they saw him jump, as they thought to see him get killed.

When I was a boy of 8 I used to play in this smoke tunnel.  After the mine closed the furnaces were pulled down and the tunnel where the smoke entered was opened up and another new hole made in the top of the tunnel.  At the foot of the stack we used to get inside and look up.  The stack would sway as all stacks do in the wind.  Looking up you would see blackness and then a thin strip of light would appear and gradually it would grow into a square before slowly narrowing again until all the light would be gone.

Burra’s Tourist Potential was assessed at a visit to Burra on Tuesday by the minister of Lands Hon. J.D. Corcoran and the Director of the SA Tourist Bureau Mr P. Pollnitz.  They were responding to an invitation from the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and his Council.  They were accompanied by Mr P.H. Quirke MP and had a tour of the town with the Mayor and Town Clerk, local historian, Mr I.L. Auhl and the Revs G.D. Sibly & M. Lind.  They visited the old Brewery Cellars, the Lock-up and Stables at Burra North, the Redruth Gaol, Bon Accord Waterworks, Miners’ Dugouts, the Mine and Aboriginal carvings in Stone Chimney Creek, etc.

They felt tourist interest in Burra had grown considerably in the past two years as a result of efforts by the National Trust and the Town Council.  Mr Pollnitz believes Burra has more tourist potential than any other SA town.  The party was conducted over the Museum by Mr S.J. Woollacott.  As a result of the visit the Tourist Bureau and Government have a better knowledge of the extent of the tourist area and any case for preservation will be given good priority.  As no Government money is available to the National Trust, the best approach will be through the Town Council.

Accident.  At about 6.15 p.m. on Saturday three miles southwest of Hanson Miss Pauline Miller of Hanson lost control of her Mini-Minor in dusty conditions caused by other vehicles and it rolled over.  She was found trapped in the upturned vehicle by members of the Bowling Club returning from Clare.  They turned the vehicle over and forced the doors open to free Miss Miller, who was unhurt except for some cuts to an ankle.

A Guided Tour of Burra has been organised by the Rector and Wardens of St Mary’s on Sunday at 1.30 p.m. from the Parish Hall.  Locals are invited to join visitors to learn more about their town.  At 4.30 p.m. Mr Ian Auhl will show the coloured film made about Burra by Mr John Kingsford-Smith and Ampol for the National Trust.  Mr Auhl will also give a lecture.

Editorial.  The editor draws attention to the recent reports on the less than encouraging indications for mining copper at Burra, but adds that there is also a statement that work by the Mines Department and Mines Exploration Co. gives promise of $30 million worth of copper could come from redevelopment of the upper part of the old mine.  But if this development occurs and disturbs old mine buildings, shafts, etc. would we want to see an activity that lasts just long enough to destroy a tourist industry that could be developed permanently?

Thomas Bath’s Letter

A letter written 116 years ago by Thomas Bath to his mother in England was recently discovered among family treasures in Bournemouth, Hampshire.  Mrs G.G. Halliday, a granddaughter of the writer gave permission for its printing.  Mrs Halliday recently donated to the school the silver trowel used by Thomas Bath to lay the foundation stone of the school in 1877.

Bath St. Kooringa

Oct. 25 1851

Dear Mother,

[Thomas apologises for not writing more often, but says a long letter of July 1850 must have miscarried and the fault is not one-sided, as he has not received a letter for nearly two years.  He then continues:]

A person, who came out in the unfortunate vessel the Naraion, by the name Jennings, told me he had brought a letter for me, but he lost everything but the clothes he was wearing when the vessel ran aground in our gulf.  All hands were landed safely though spread along 200 miles of coast.  One woman died when she fell from a dray on the road to town.

I heard from Jennings that you had heard from brothers John and Henry and that was the first I had heard of them since their arrival in San Francisco, though a great many people are coming back here that went to California about the same time as my brothers.  I hope you will write to me immediately on receipt of this and give me every information about my brothers etc.

I herewith enclose half a £5 note of Bank at East Cornwall.  The other half I will forward by next mail as a precaution in case one of the letters might miss.  I am still at Kooringa as the heading of this letter indicates and the town has gone ahead wonderfully with now a population of 6,000.  We have a church, 2 Wesleyan chapels, an Independent Chapel, Baptist, Primitive, Bible Christian, German Lutheran, Roman Catholic etc.

The Burra Burra Mines are still holding on as well as ever, though not quite as profitable to the shareholders, being unable to declare the usual quarterly dividend of 200% this time due to the long and wet winter.  There are 30,000 tons of ore accumulated at the mine with an estimated value of £120,000.

We have extensive Smelting Works in successful operation, but these too have been idle in winter on account of being unable to get firewood, the roads being in such a wretched state.  Now with the dry weather they are again in full work.  They have 16 furnaces at work.  They principally use coal, part of which comes from England and part from Newcastle NSW.  It is landed at Port Wakefield 60 miles from Kooringa and is carted here at 33/- per ton in winter and 25/- in summer each way, up and down – they take down copper and copper ores.

This summer they will employ all the drays they can get which will be I think about 400 besides their own drays, which is about 150 more.  Their circulation amounts to upwards of £161,320 p.a.

Kooringa has been much affected by the discovery of gold in NSW.  Some 300 persons have gone.  One party of five men left for the gold diggings and returned after ten weeks without any success.  On Friday I saw a man called Hall who left the smelting works when earning 30/- a week and on his return was glad to get the same place at 25/- per week.  Letters from men at the diggings appear very contradictory.

[He mentions as at Sydney diggings: William Dunstan, Willy & Benny Dunstan from Burra, Edward Moyle and William Dower.]

Within the last few days there has been nothing talked of but Port Phillip where gold has been found in immense quantities says the report.  A great many have left already with a great many more about to go.

I am carrying on business as before in General Store – my stock consists of Drapery, Grocery, Ironmongery, Glass and Earthenware etc.  I also have a Timber Yard and a banking [baking?] business here.  At my bakehouse I employ two men and a horse and cart to ??? the bread around town.  In my shop I have three shopmen besides myself and a clerk at the books.  I have another shop where I carry on business of the same kind as in Kooringa, where I keep two men, a draper and a grocer and am doing business in each place – except in timber.  There has not been much doing due to so many leaving for the gold diggings.  I sometimes get a whole cargo of timber consigned to me and my name has always been A1 since my arrival, or since I commenced business.

Benny Dunstan has returned from the gold diggings with about 30 others from this place and another of others since.  They say a great many there are doing well and hundreds not earning their salt and many who would return, but have not the means.  Pt Phillip is now all that is talked of and thousands are leaving this Colony for that place.  I expect they will be as much disappointed as those who went to Sydney.

Since the former part of this letter was written three of my hands have left me for the diggings.  In consequence I have sold my baking business, which I did not much care about, as the profit was not large and I find I have quite enough without it in my two shops.

I will write again in the course of a few days.  Mt respects to all my brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, cousins and enquiring friends.

You Most Dutiful Son,

Thomas Bath.

The Tour of Burra organised by the Rector and Wardens of St Mary’s was a success and attracted many residents as well as visitors including Adelaide people and two New Zealanders.  Over 100 adults and children spent an interesting afternoon led by Mr Ian Auhl.  St Mary’s church was comfortably filled as others joined to see the films on Burra and to hear Mr Auhl’s address.  The Anglican Quartet rendered a motet.  Jan Cockington and Rosemary Reed played a duet and Rev. Sibly played an organ solo and accompanied hymn singing.

Late Night Closing of Shops will operate in Burra for Friday 22 December.  Businesses will open from 7-9 p.m.

Burra Hospital Building Fund Appeal stands at $10,135.

The Chairman of the Board said despite the poor season the building project could not be postponed because of the poor state of the operating theatre, which is completely outdated and building should start in summer to minimise delays due to weather.  The appeal will officially close on 12 December.

Burra Hospital Building Fund Appeal raised $11,311, of which the committee raised $840.  The Board is gratified with this sum, given the poor seasonal conditions.  When subsidised this will give a total of $34,000, which when added to funds already in hand will enable the completion of the building.  Funds in hand include a bequest from the Alice Collins Estate of $11,000, or $33,000 when subsidised.  It has as a consequence been decided to call the new building the Alice Collins Wing.  It will house an up-to-date X-Ray Department, Operating theatre and Casualty Ward.  Although funds will cover the building operations the actual cost of equipping the various sections is not easily assessable.  The overall plan is expected to cost $200,000 and of this residents of the district have contributed $11,000 for Phase I and a similar amount for Phase III.  With a bequest of $11,000 this makes a total of $33-34,000, giving $100,000 with subsidy.  Towards this end the ladies of various district committees which combined to form the Fund Raising Committee are to be congratulated on their annual effort.

Accident.  Mr Leonard William McCann of Whyalla lost control of his car one mile east of Burra en route to a holiday in Sydney last week.  The car overturned, plunged through a fence and into the gully below.  The vehicle was a write-off, though neither the driver nor a passenger was injured.

The Burra Swimming Pool.  The cost of repairs to the chlorination plant has been advised to total $150.  This is felt to be satisfactory due to the very satisfactory way it now operates.

Burra Cemetery.  The shelter shed [i.e. the Mortuary Chapel] is to be repainted and have its guttering renewed.

The footbridge opposite the Town Hall is to be reformed and bituminised.

Jack Jenner of Spalding, President of the North Eastern Football League for the past 12 years, has been voted the first Life Member of the League.

The church was filled to capacity.  Rev. Dr M. McArthur, Associate Director of the Department of Christian Education of the Methodist Church, was a very capable preacher for the occasion.  The High School Choir made a worthwhile contribution led by Mr Peter Morris.

Headmaster Mr Robert Farrow conducted the service assisted by the Parish Priest of St Mary’s Rev. G.D. Sibly and the Minister of the Burra Methodist Circuit, Rev. M.A. Lind.  [Details in 1 column.]

Burra district Fund Raising Committee held its AGM.  The committees that combine to make this committee have raised $12-15,000 in the past ten years.  This money has been spent on hospital equipment and amenities for patients.  The Hospital Board had asked that this year an amount of $840 be allowed to be used for the building fund, with any surplus to go towards equipment and amenities.  The delegates present agreed.  Committees represented were:

The Hallett Committee

Burra Mine.  The Chairman of Broken Hill South Ltd at its annual meeting said that at Burra percussion drilling of the oxidised ore was completed.  Indications are of 3.3 million tons at 1.6% copper and a waste to ore ratio of 1.4 to 1.  The economic feasibility of an operation at Burra is marginal.  More sampling and a pilot testing is needed to determine the mining recovery.

Burra town Council representatives visited the Renmark Effluent Drainage Scheme and said they were impressed.  The co-operation given by the Public Health Department was excellent said Mayor E.T. Baulderstone.  Representatives of seven Councils attended the field day.  Problems caused by underground water and cracking soil had been solved using Ceramiflex flexible plastic jointed clay pipes.  The scheme would cost ratepayers about $20 p.a. for the average property.  An impressive aspect was the way in which soil was removed from the trenches, carted away and returned when filling was needed.  The streets were thus kept free from unsightly heaps of soil and dust problems were reduced.  The speed of laying the pipes at up to 1,000 feet per day was also impressive.

Vandalism has occurred at the Burra Swimming Pool where the culprits were apparently throwing stones at light globes erected to decorate the Carols Evening on Sunday.  A number of the stones ended up in the pool.

Burra Primary School

Mr Ian Auhl was farewelled by students on Thursday afternoon at a ceremony at the Burra Primary School.  With his great knowledge of local history he proved to be a teacher to many adults as well as to his school pupils.  Mrs Perry spoke for students and staff and said that both students and staff were deeply sorry to be losing both Mr & Mrs Auhl.  Penny Miller made a neat little speech, and helped by Debbie Kirk, made a presentation of a silver jug.  Chairman of the School Committee Mr R. Moreland added his appreciation.  Mrs Carpenter spoke on behalf of the School Welfare Club and also as a staff member.  Rev. Geoffrey Sibly spoke for the religious instructors.  Mr Auhl replied saying it was hard to leave a school where he had a school and student to be proud of.  He paid tribute to the great assistance of his wife.  Prize-giving and presentation of Progress Certificates was also held on Thursday.

Alan Braendler & Robert Padbury shared the Andrew Tennant Award for Dux of Grade VII.

Characteristics of the paper in 1967

Generally quite a good coverage of local news, though a considerable amount of the material refers to more distant mid north centres like Spalding, Saddleworth, Manoora and Riverton.  After the first couple of page sport dominates the paper.

Page 1

This carries most of the news.

Page 2

For much of the year this was the familiar mixture of a few large advertisements with public notices, advertising for land sales and for district events.  This changed late in the year (from 24 October) when editorials reappeared for the first time in many years.  The page was then typically: Editorial, Cash Column, some larger advertisements and local news and sports, with the previous page two material moved on to page 3.

Pages 3-8 & from October page 2 & 4-8

Typically dominated by larger advertisements with perhaps 2 to 4 columns devoted to sports and some news.  Of the latter District Council reports comprised a large, but rather unedifying part.  Some non-local pieces were common, including a regular column on ‘Last Week in State Parliament’ by the local MP John Freebairn.

Out and About by ‘Mrs Maggs’ (Mary Woollacott) was an important and very useful column for local births, birthdays, deaths and other events.  This is a valuable help for local historian, even if the obituaries etc. are exceeding brief.  This varied in location, but was often on page 7 and varied generally from one to two column

The Learn to Swim Campaign for 1968 has concluded in Burra.  173 children received instruction from Messrs Paul Tattersall and Russell Nicholls assisted by Randal Miller.

Burra Town Hall Pictures

Attendances have dropped rather drastically in the last six months.

This represents a fall in attendance of 26% in the last half of the year.  Over the last six months the venture has been operating at a small loss.  This cannot continue.  Attendances were bad in 1966, improved in the first half of 1967 and then fell again.  Some special bigger films have been booked and will carry slightly greater admission charges.  Let’s hope attendances will improve.  For the first night of 1968 it was 126.

Burra Mine.  Drilling operations continue.

About 70 holes have been put down, some to 300 ft and samples are being analysed and the results checked with small shafts to about 50 ft, ten of which are to be sunk over ten of the 70 drill holes.  Each will yield about 40 tons of material for checking at the Cobar facilities.  It is hoped to complete one shaft each week.  Bill Wiseman from Adelaide is in charge assisted by Supervisors Mr M. Corradini & Mr J. Boyce of Broken Hill.

Weather.  A severe thunderstorm with hail struck an area between Farrell Flat and Hanson at about 2 p.m. last Wednesday.  Hail as large as marbles fell and torrential rain for about 80 minutes with a total of about 320 points.  Homes were flooded at Farrell Flat.  The Burra Burra DC road gang was at work in the midst of it on the main road, which turned into a quagmire.  On the other side of Farrell Flat the road’s top metal was washed away, but six miles on, where a Clare Council gang was working only about 60 points fell.  The railway line was damaged and goods trains were delayed for some time.  Water ran into Porter’s Lagoon, which had been practically dry.  Water was a foot deep over the road at the Koonoona turn-off.  Fences were washed away in the vicinity.

At C.W. Neill’s property 150 points fell and on the section known as ‘Riggs’ half the area was too wet to inspect and the rest received almost nothing.  Piggott’s got an inch, but Ron Winders said he got nothing worth mentioning.  At Gum Creek Robert Neill was harrowing on Thursday morning with one section of paddock providing good working and the other two or three hundred yards away was too hard to work.  In all it did more harm than good except for the water catchment value.

Accident.  A drawbar coupling a truck to a semi-trailer broke when it was on Moonlight Hill allowing the semi-trailer to roll backwards down the hill.

It has now been decoded to effect repairs on the spot.

Burra Swimming Pool.  There are rumours about the water treatment of the pool this year.  In fact the water is very clean and has been in excellent condition throughout the season.  There are, however, some dead algae on the floor of the pool, which vacuum cleaning alone cannot shift due to the rough surface.  After consultation with experts it is now being moved using stainless steel brushes, though a stain on the bottom will remain.  The pool is still open and has not been closed or condemned.

Fire.  A fire in the Koomooloo Station homestead on Tuesday last caused damage estimated at $12,000.  It began at about 7.45 a.m. in the domestic section of a building attached by verandah to the main homestead and occupied by Mr & Mrs Michael Avery and family.  Mr Avery was working at the woolshed drafting sheep when smoke was noticed coming from the house.  Mrs Avery tried to enter the kitchen, but was driven back by the heat.  She ran around the outside to an end entrance where Miss Davies, the governess, was called from the room.  Mr Avery tried to hose down the fire, but the pressure was inadequate and a thousand gallons tank and pump was brought by truck from a nearby paddock.  The connecting verandah was torn down to save the rest of the house.  Only a small part of the attached building was saved.  The source is unclear, but probably one of two kerosene fridges or a combustion type water heater was the origin.  Temperatures on the day were well over 100°F.  Sgt Orford and Constable K. Terry of Burra are preparing a report for the coroner.

Burra High School.  Christopher freeman, son of Mr & Mrs A. Freeman of Booborowie has gained an Intermediate Bursary.

M.G. Stockman reported on the 93rd show [It was nothing like the 93rd!] opened by Hon. C.R. Kelly MHR on 7 October 1967.  With a new record number of entries it was a great success.  Horse in Action Section was again the highlight. Wool entries were satisfactory despite the poor season.  The sheep pavilion was nicely filled.  Flowers were very good again despite the dry season.  The district schools put on a good display and the Industrial Displays were numerous and comprehensive.  The Agricultural Pavilion was well filled with produce, vegetable, cookery, art and needlework.  Poultry and birds were well represented and dog and goat entries are increasing each year.  Many thanks go to the stewards and convenors and to the new secretary, Julie Sara.  Financially it was a success and the overdraft is gradually being reduced.

Phil Rule of Hamilton Place, Adelaide, writes wondering if sports at Burra could be given a boost by making the racecourse property into a Community Sports Arena.  He suggests that if it is done it be called the James Gallagher Memorial Sports Ground, in tribute to the man sho did much work and dug deep into his own pocket to support sports in Burra and was the first Chairman of the Syndicate which started the idea of the grounds many years ago.  The avenue of pines could be named Birdseye Avenue in honour of the late Alf Birdseye, who planted and tended the trees in their early stages.

Burra Primary School Committee.  Chairman R.A. Moreland’s Report

Discussion has resulted in the Public Buildings Department being about to install a fire hydrant.  Sports day on the War Memorial Oval on 28 April was a great success.  Many parents attended Arbor Day.  Burra Burra DC has helped in filling and levelling the creek area of the oval.  It was decided to crop the old garden area to produce hay for sale, but although the ground was sown by Mr K. Gare and germinated well, the rains failed and the crop was lost.  Mr Wardle purchased the paddock at the rear of the school, impeding access to Burra North.  He agreed to allow access along the side of Mrs Tattersall’s residence and the Public Buildings Department is preparing to provide an access path there.  The Town Council has tidied up and screened the section of footpath to Mrs Tattersall’s and provided a pipe for the drain.  A school crossing has been made in front of the Town Hall.  We are negotiating with the Education Department for future accommodation to be supplied in Burra.  Mr & Mrs Auhl were farewelled.  In 1967 Mrs Villis resigned and her position was taken by Miss Satchell.  Miss Satchell was later transferred and Mrs Carpenter filled the position.  Mrs Said was also transferred.  This year there are two new teachers and a new Headmistress.  The Town Council advises that the land in front of the school has been transferred to the Education Department.

Accident.  A semi-trailer loaded with cattle overturned at Hanson on Friday night.  The driver suffered broken ribs.  Two transports owned by Whittam Transport Pty Ltd of Strathalbyn were taking cattle from Strathalbyn to Broken Hill.  The second vehicle overturned at the Hanson corner.  The driver was Mr Darrell Malcolm Wray of Meadows.  Most of the 68 cows and calves were roaming around.  One calf was killed and another three cows had to be destroyed.  The lost animals were valued at $500.  Damage to the vehicle was estimated at $3,800.  Mr Tom Rogers and others helped round up the cattle.  The district Council grader and bulldozer were used to right the vehicle on Saturday morning.  Another prime-mover was brought in and the damaged one returned to Strathalbyn.

The Annual Field Days organised by 46 studs were concluded on Friday on a satisfactory note.  The wool market has been depressed and seasonal conditions have been adverse.  Daily following this year was between 700 and 1,000, estimated to be 25% down on last year’s record.  Mr Cowell, a representative of SA Stud Breeders, said stockowners favoured a lifting of the ban on exporting Merino sheep, because the world needed to produce more good apparel wool – in India for example the average fleece was only 2 lb.  The embargo was introduced in 1929.  Mr Simpson from Queensland agreed.  Mr Toll of WA said the Wool Conference in Perth favoured lifting the ban on the export of rams, under controlled conditions.

Burra Hospital

The new theatre and casualty block at the Burra Hospital is nearing completion.  The new building will have the same floor level as the remainder of the Hospital and its tiled floors, shining fixtures and fittings will lend itself to sterility and efficiency.  A diesel plant automatically comes into operation when a power fault occurs; the changeover takes fifteen seconds and this is covered by a battery operated second auxiliary, whose batteries are automatically kept charged.  As soon as the new theatre is ready the old theatre block will be reconstructed into domestic quarters, a board room and a sewing room.  Despite the difficult seasons lately the Departmental Inspector reports that the district has raised $12,565 to the 29 February.  The Hospital’s financial position is satisfactory.  Average costs have fallen because occupied bed strength has increased by 2.3 per day and this has resulted from the increased use of beds by pensioner patients.  Mrs G. Stanley Hawker and other members of her family have presented a painting The Bark Painter by George Chaloupka, which will hang in the main hallway.  It is a memorial to their mother the late Mrs E.M. Fetherstonhaugh.

Paxton Square

The Lewis Trust which owns historic Paxton Square has recently been expanded to include local trustees as well as two trustees from the Lewis family.  Mr Robert Lewis, former Master of St Mark’s College, Adelaide, resigned as Public Officer and Chairman of the Lewis Trust earlier this year when he went to become Master of Menzies College at Latrobe University, Melbourne.  He is a son of the late Essington Lewis.  Rev. G.D. Sibly was elected in his place as Chairman and Public Officer and five other prominent leading citizens were elected to the Board of Management.  Some tidying up has followed and the trustees now intend to evaluate the whole position of the buildings forming the square.  Paxton Square is unique in Australia, not only as a well-preserved example of Cornish architecture, but because it marks the first attempt by an employer to provide mass housing for its employees.  The employer was the SA Mining Assoc., which had established Kooringa as their private town on Section 1, which they had bought for $20,000.  Until the Mine closed in September 1877 all houses and shops in Burra were leased from the Mining Association.

[This is incorrect.  Initially SAMA granted only leasehold in Kooringa, but from 1868 freehold was granted and was encouraged through the 1870s, though SAMA remained a significant landlord well into the 20th century, with a final attempt to sell off remaining properties in 1912 in its winding up operations.]

Early in 1852 the bulk of the men employed in the Mine left for the Victorian gold-diggings and it was well into 1853 before they returned and work could be resumed at the Mine.  In the meantime the Association had taken steps to bring out miners from England and it was to provide homes for these underground workers that Paxton Square was built.

[This is also incorrect.  See Ian Auhl, Paxton Square Burra South Australia, Investigator Press, n.d. in which he cites the evidence for the construction of the cottages earlier than this.  A painting of 1850 by S.T. Gill shows 11 cottages on the western side and some on the southern side.  They are also marked on the 1849 plan of Kooringa.  There construction was a response to flooding of dugouts in the creek banks.  Of course, some of the miners mentioned above could well have been housed there.]

The 33 cottages were built by Cornishmen for Cornish miners.  In later years [1913] when the Mining Association was selling its properties in Kooringa, the Hon. John Lewis, father of Essington Lewis, purchased the Square and at his death [1923] the houses were left in trust to house the needy and poor of Burra.

[This had been his intention in 1913 and he had hoped to see nominal ownership vested in the Town Council.  They declined because they feared being saddled with the maintenance costs.]

In 1845 William Paxton was a young chemist living behind his shop in Rundle Street, Adelaide, when Burra copper was discovered.  Paxton with Bunce and other Rundle [& Hindley] Street shop-keepers subscribed the necessary capital.  Paxton invested $240.  Within a year the $10 shares were worth $200 and the dividend was 600%.  Paxton bought more shares and became a Mine Director and a wealthy man.  He acquired large properties in Kooringa, owning the two hotels and Paxton Square, where the cottages were later built.  He later ran for Parliament for Port Adelaide, but his interests in politics gave way to pastoral pursuits.  The cottages originally had dirt floors and no verandahs.  There have been few changes to them over the years.

Accident/Obituary.  C.W. (Bill) Knight of Burra aged 56 died as the result of an accident at Booborowie in the early hours of Friday morning.  Mr Knight had been working north of Broken Hill for the past five weeks and was coming home for Easter.  He dropped a workmate off at Caltowie at about midnight and then proceeded to Burra.  Near Booborowie Hall he failed to negotiate a bend and the station wagon he was driving ran into a culvert on the right hand side of the road, resulting in his death.

Common Effluent drain for Burra

The Department of Public Health is drawing up final plans for Burra’s effluent drainage.  It will include Commercial Street, Market Square, Hill Street, Ware Street, Kangaroo Street, Queen Street, Chapel Street, Lloyd Street and Thames Street.  The proposed site for the biological filter is in Thames Street on land adjoining the Council Pound.  Because of the terrain in some streets only those on the high side will be connected.  Houses on the low side will have backyards to sink soakage wells, whereas many on the high side have no land on which to drain septic tank overflow.  The Corporation has requested the Department to install the drain in the water table rather than in the footpath, but that will be up to the Department.

The equipment is fully up-to-date and the new radium theatre light, counterbalanced and moveable in any direction, comes directly from Germany and is the latest in design. The theatre is air conditioned and has anti-static floors and X-ray viewers for on the spot checks.  Gasses are automatically fed and water in the scrub-up room is pre-heated and sterilised by ultra-violet light.  The automatic back-up power and light system adds to the efficiency.

Burra & District Ambulance Committee met on 22 May.  In the past 12 months Members’ subscriptions have fallen by $90.  Membership subscription is $2 or $1 for pensioners.

Fire/Obituary.  Mr Donald Simmons (46) a bachelor farmer of Whyte Yarcowie was a guest at the Burra Hotel on Thursday night.  He retired to an upstairs bedroom and apparently was smoking in bed when his bedding caught alight early on Friday morning.  At 6.25 a.m. the proprietor Mr King Grubb arose and found smoke in the building, which he traced to the upstairs room.  He groped his way to the bed and found it still occupied by Mr Simmons.  He pulled the man into the passage and called the fire brigade, the doctor and the police.  Both Doctors Kirk and Miller attended and found the man dead.  The bedding was not actually in flames, but the smoke had suffocated the victim and smoke damage to the room was estimated at $300.

Mayor E.T. Baulderstone wrote to the paper.  He called for more community effort and involvement in Burra.  He said that having been Mayor for 14 years he would do his best, but it gets harder as he gets older and he needs more help.  Burra lacks the assistance other places get from having a Progress Association, a Junior Chamber of Commerce, Rotary of Apex Clubs.  During the coming year he will be calling a meeting to discuss future arrangements for the Burra & District Swimming Pool.  He will also be seeking help later to form a Tourist Committee, which is important for the town.  He also flags his opinion that Local Government must get bigger to be more efficient and says that his Council has already commenced negotiations with the Burra Burra DC on the subject of a merger.

Obituary.  Keith Wesley Gare died on Tuesday as a result of an accident [near Balranald] when he was returning from judging at the Deniliquin Show in NSW.  He was born at Burra in 1926.  He received his primary education at Mt Bryan East School and his secondary education at Burra High School and Prince Alfred College.  As a member of the ATC he enlisted in the RAAF as soon as he was eligible by age and trained as a fighter pilot, serving until the end of WW II.  At the end of hostilities he returned to the family property ‘Glenview’ at Mt Bryan East where he worked with his father Mr Lewis Gare.  In 1952 he married Miss Shirley Seal and continued to work at Mt Bryan East until the family purchased ‘The Pines’ at Burra North, when he and his family took up residence there.  The scope of his interests and abilities is shown in the number of organisations to which he belonged.  A president of the Mt Bryan Cricket Club, he was also a member of the Burra Hospital Board, the Primary School Committee and the Burra Show Committee.  He was a keen supporter of the Rural Youth movement and the first President of the Hallett Agricultural Bureau after its transfer from Mt Bryan East and remained a member of the Hallett Branch.  He was a Past Master of the Hallett Masonic Lodge.  Mr Gare employed his wide knowledge of sheep breeding as a judge in the Merino Section of shows throughout Australia, in capital cities and country centres.  Although ‘Glen View’ Stud was registered in 1927, its development to the present high standard was largely due to the recent management of Mt Gare and his interest in breeding lines took him all over Australia.  He travelled long distances to assist breeders and growers in classing lambs bred from his lines.  In 1966 he became President of the SA Branch of the Studbreeders’ Association.  He was keen to have the embargo on Merino sheep export lifted.  At his funeral over 700 mourners paid their respects and with 80 Masons present it was one of the largest gatherings of the Masonic Lodge at any country funeral in SA.  He is survived by his wife Shirley, and children Kay, Lester, Julie and Gregory and by brother Donald and sisters Melva (Mrs A. McInnes) and Glenda (Mrs D. Bailey) and his parents Mr & Mrs Gare Senior.  [Keith Weseley Gare born 29 April 1926 Kooringa: died as Keith Wesley Gare 11 June 1968 Adelaide, residence Burra North.]

Weather.  This season has had a pattern of weekly rains, which are hampering seeding operations, but benefiting pastures, filling surface catchments and replenishing aquifers.  Wheat already sown is doing well.  Some areas are suffering lucerne flea or mite.  Roads have suffered damage and streams are generally flowing.  Falls in the last week have been between 50 and 100 points generally.  Burra recorded 75 points.  [There is an extended summary of seasonal conditions.]

Weather.  In the past week rains came in from the east with falls of up to 150 points in the pastoral areas.  Run-off was generated.  Germination of grasses and rapid growth has followed.  Rains continue to hamper sewing in the agricultural areas.  Crops already sown continue to prosper.  Dust Hole Creek flooded on Friday after 154 points in the area.  It is now running with clear water from seepage, a thing Me Les Thomas says he has not seen for some 40 years.

Burra Swimming Pool.  At a public meeting called by the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone a management committee was formed to operate the pool and its facilities.  At first it was run by the committee which oversaw its construction. This was then replaced by the Burra & District Swimming Pool Committee.  Over the years interest apparently waned and two years ago it was virtually forced onto the Council.  Since then, despite an operating profit, the pool has not made enough to meet the repayment of the loan incurred for the filtration plant.  The average attendance of 85 makes it clear that maintenance and operation of the pool has to be on a volunteer basis.  It would be disastrous to take the pool away from the youth of the town.  The committee of twelve will be elected annually.

John McDouall Stuart.  An Article by Mr Ian Auhl requested by the PMG Department, Canberra.

On 25 July 1860 John McDouall Stuart, in his third attempt to cross Australia, reached the north coast some 50 miles east of the present site of Darwin.  After raising the flag etc. he and his party set out on the 2,500 mile journey to Adelaide.  Four months later on 27th December they reached the edge of settlement at Mt Margaret Station, west of Lake Eyre.  A month later they reached Mt Remarkable and caught the mail coach to Burra.  Burra had the most northerly telegraph station in SA in 1862.  Stuart was anxious to let the world know that he had accomplished his task.  In Adelaide anxiety was being felt for his safety after not hearing from him for almost a year.  When the coach reached Kooringa at about 6 p.m. on 16 December Stuart sent the telegram:

John McDouall Stuart, Commander of the South Australian Northern Exploring Expedition, to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.

Kooringa, Dec. 16th 1862

‘Through you I beg to inform His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief and the Government that I have accomplished the object of the expedition.  Party all well.  I will be in town by the evening train tomorrow.’

This was followed by a second telegram by Chambers at 6.30 p.m. on the same afternoon.

Dec. 16th Kooringa

Telegram to Mr Finke from Mr Chambers.

‘Stuart, Auld and self home by last train tomorrow.  Party all well!’

The Register correspondent reported Stuart was greeted by a large crowd and presented with an address.

The last train referred to in Chamber’s telegram was from Kapunda, then the northern terminus and about 50 miles from both Adelaide and Burra.  Register correspondent again reported next day that Stuart had arrived accompanied by Mr Auld and his party, Capt. McKay of Mt Deception and Mr John Chambers.  Mr Stuart was enthusiastically received by a large crowd.  He appeared in a very low condition, having suffered from scurvy for a great part of the trip and alighted from the coach with difficulty.  Mr W.H. Wilkinson read the address.

[The address is printed together with Stuart’s reply.]

The correspondent also reported Stuart’s departure by the Adelaide Mail for the city.  Another large crowd assembled and another address was read and presented to Stuart.  Mr McDermott SM read this address.  He and Mr Mayne JP and Mr J.B. Anderson JP had escorted the explorer from his room in the hotel to the Mail bus.  Nine carts full of people followed the Mail bus for about three miles, where they gave three hearty cheers before returning to Kooringa.

[The address read by McDermott is also printed.]

Peter Thomas Fairchild, eldest son of Mr & Mrs Norman Fairchild of Mitchell Park and late of Booborowie, leaves Adelaide on 29 July to spend a year in the USA as an American Field Service Exchange student.  He is 18 and born at Booborowie and received most of his primary schooling there.  He has three brothers: Roland 14, Brenton 12 and Colin 7.

Sir Frederick Holder has been remembered with the naming of a new metropolitan electorate for the House of Representatives after him.  He was closely connected with Burra.  He was born 12 May 1850, the son of Morecott Holder of Happy Valley and trained as a teacher.  He felt that journalism would hold greater opportunities and while still a young man secured possession of the Burra Record.  He was described as a ‘trenchant and graceful’ writer and contributed to the Adelaide Register and high class English newspapers.  He became Town Clerk of Burra from 1879 to 1884 and was Mayor in 1887. [And 1889.]  In 1887 he was elected to the House of Assembly and two years later was first Treasurer in Sir John Cockburn’s cabinet.  He was Premier of SA briefly in 1892 and for 1899-1901.  In 1901 he was made a Knight Commander of St Michael & St George.  When the Commonwealth was established he became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives.  He was a greatly respected Speaker, known for his fairness and the dignified way he carried out his duties. He collapsed at his post with an apoplectic seizure at 6.30 a.m. on 23 July 1909 following a strenuous all-night sitting on the subject of the old age pension.  He died at 4 p.m. the same day without regaining consciousness.  Thousands lined the route of his state funeral in Adelaide on 26 July despite torrential rain.

Arbor Day was held at Burra Primary School last Friday and more than 110 visitors attended.  The school was open for visitors and the theme for the day was Australian Trees.  Mrs M. Rayner of Hallett delivered the address after which 14 trees were planted around the school oval.  [Tree planters are listed.]

Advt.  Burra Pictures.  The secretary of the Burra Town Hall Picture Committee reports a drop in attendance for the past financial year of 416 or 9% and consequently a loss of $110.

Attendances:

If attendances do not significantly increase serious consideration will have to be given to closing down the Town Hall Pictures.  This would be a pity, but it is hardly worthwhile obtaining the better films available if the residents are not going to patronise them.  Three persons work voluntarily each Saturday night.  It costs $17 plus the film hire (average $24) to put on a show.  To cover this attendance will have to rise considerably from the present average of 87.  One need to lift attendance is the better behaviour of children and teenagers present.  Parents could help by coming along and keeping their own children under control.  The outcome is in the hands of the residents of Burra.  It is stressed that the aim of increasing attendance cannot be achieved without a great improvement in the behaviour of the children attending.  The committee has found it necessary to abolish the front stalls and charge 30c for children anywhere downstairs – they had been buying 20c seats and moving into 30c seats during the program.

Visit of the Minister of Local Government

The Hon M. Hill with Mrs Hill and Mr Claude Allen MP & Mrs Allen visited Burra as part of a two day tour of the area.  Members of the Town and District Councils and their wives met the visitors at the Town Hall.  The ladies visited the National Trust Museum and the CWA rooms for afternoon tea.  The Minister and Mr Allen joined the Town Council in the Parlour.  The main discussion centred upon reclaiming the central portion of the cemetery.  This discussion had gone on for some years and Mr Hill brought with him the complete file.  His explanation showed the reclaiming was not simple and could, in the future, have repercussions.  He felt the opening of a new section on the eastern side of the cemetery would be more satisfactory.  Grant monies were also discussed.  The large length of roads and small population and other difficulties in qualifying for grants were mentioned.  Mr Hill was sure there was no special grant for cemetery maintenance.  He agreed with Council amalgamations in principle, but it was up to individual Councils to come to terms.  Mr Hill then had afternoon tea with the District Council.  Again he heard of the difficulties the Council was having – especially the sealing of the Spalding-Morgan Road and of the Farrell Flat-Hanson Road.  Councils, he said, could do the work more cheaply than the Highways & Local Government Department.  He repeated his comments on Council amalgamations.  A deputation from Booborowie lobbied for sealing of town streets.

Burra Hospital

The Hon. R.C. De Garis, Chief Secretary and Minister of health opened the Alice Collins Theatre and Casualty Block on Friday.  The Vice-Chairman Mr A.J. Ashby introduced the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone, who gave a brief address in which he went through some of the recent history of the redevelopment of the Hospital.  Chairman of the Board Mr R.K. Pearse spoke, saying that since plans were formulated in 1963 $160,000 had been spent in capital outlay and $40,000 in maintenance. The work had been done in three stages.  Stages 1 7 3 had been accomplished through public subscription from appeals [subsidised by Government].  The second stage had been financed by a bequest from the estate of the late Miss Alice Collins who had spent her last four years as an inmate of the hospital.  Mr Pearse then asked Mr De Garis to declare the wing open.  A plaque bearing the words Alice Collins Wing was unveiled by Mr A.K. Hanlin of Burra.

Obituary.  Mr J.B. (Jack) Rowe died at Burra Hospital on 12 July.  His death severs one of the last links with the sheep droving era of the pastoral lands east and north of Burra.  He was born in Burra on 12 January 1907, the eldest son of the late Jack and Helen Rowe.  He worked with sheep practically all his life and was a well known figure around the sale yards.  He was regularly sought when sheep had to be mustered for shearing and was employed on most of the properties in the eastern pastoral area.  He worked for over a period of thirty years or more on Mr J.R. Barker’s property at Baldina.  In his early life his dray, horse and several dogs were a familiar sight throughout the district.  Some droving trips took him as far away as Wentworth in NSW.  In more recent years the dray gave way to a motor vehicle and motor cycle.  He was a member of the RAOB Lodge.  He is survived by his widow, daughter Joan and son John and three grandchildren.  Also by three sisters and two brothers: Dorrie, Flora, Fan, Alf and Harry.

District Roads.  Answers to question in Parliament.

Traffic densities justify the sealing of Main Road 140 from Burra to Booborowie.  Preconstruction activities will mean this is not expected to commence before 1969-70.

The Burra-Morgan Road will be developed to open surface standard over a period of years.  $20,000 has been provided to begin work.  This is not a high priority and work on the Morgan end will now commence in 1970-71.

When the Burra section is complete work on the Robertstown section will begin, but this is not likely before 1970-71.  Over the next five years it is expected $20,000 will be available annually for work in the Burra District.  From 1969-70 $50,000 p.a. should be available for the Morgan area.

Burra Caravan Park.  The Minister of Tourism has advised of a grant of up to $162 on a dollar for dollar basis for six additional power points for caravans in the Burra Caravan Park.

Burra Hospital.  Chairman R.K. Pearse’s Report 1967-68.  The 91st Annual Report

Capital assets increased by $78, 921 due to the extensive building program.  Liquid assets stand at $21,890; down $8, 215.  The general account overdraft is $1,649 compared with $4,342 last year.  The overall credit balance is $17,548.  The Government subsidy increased by #3,090 and patients’ fees rose $4,765.  At present there is no need to increase patients’ fees, which were last raised in November 1965.

The average number of in-patients rose by 2.5 to 18.5 – an all-time high.

The average cost of out-patients fell by 50c to $2.30.

Births at the hospital rose to 50.

The year saw the completion of the ‘Alice Collins’ Theatre and Casualty Wing and the domestic quarters.  These additions plus equipment will cost approximately $100,000, not all of which is subsidised.  Since the building program was commenced we have expended $160,000 on capital improvements and $40,000 on maintenance.  The new wing was opened on 2 August by the Chief Secretary Hon. R.C. De Garis.  There are now plans to modernise the Maternity Wing and the kitchen.  The equipment for the Intensive Care Ward has to be purchased and the Board hopes to standardise on St Andrew’s type beds throughout the hospital.  The cropping program is receiving little support unfortunately and this year wheat sales produced only $229.  The Ladies’ Auxiliary continues its good work in sewing and stocking jams and preserves and now operates in adequate facilities.  The Fund Raising Committee contributed $840 towards equipment purchases.

The Matron and nursing staff have given excellent service as have the domestic staff and handy man.  The appeal for building funds produced a generous $13,302 despite the dry season, and this was greatly appreciated.

The death of respected Board Member Mr Keith Gare was deeply regretted.  We thank Mrs A.D. Radford for her services and we lose her this year and welcome Mrs H. Treweeke and Mr W.A. Field to the Board.

The Mine area was visited yesterday by the Minister of Mines the Hon. R.C. De Garis, the Director of Mines Mr Barnes, the Local MP Mr E.C. Allen and a representative of Mines Exploration Ltd Mr Roberts.  It is part of a familiarisation study by Mr De Garis of areas of the state with mineral resources.  Mr De Garis said studies had shown the presence in Burra of sufficient copper ore (something like 1½%).  There remains the problem of gaining the ore on a commercial basis.  Tests continue, but how long it will take to get a breakthrough is unknown.

Unfortunately bad weather prevented further painting on Sunday and this has been postponed till next Sunday.  The opening of the pool is scheduled for the first Saturday in November.  The paint being used is an Epoxy Resin based paint, which should give a smooth finish and is hoped, will not lift with normal use.

Burra Show was held on Saturday in perfect weather.  Gate takings of $486 were up on the previous year and overall entries of 2527 were just under the 1967 record. Secretary Miss Judy Beinke had arrangements well in hand.  There were 900 entries in Horse-in-Action.  The opening was performed by Mr E.C. Allen MP.

[In his speech Mr Allen referred to activities at the Burra Mine.  He said drilling there had revealed approximately 3.4 million tons of ore, which could be mined by open cut, though there remained the problem of separating the copper from the rock.  At present they can recover 60%, but 80% is needed to make it a payable proposition and work on a process is continuing.  Id they are successful the Mine should employ 35-50 men directly for approximately 10 years.  This would be a great boost for Burra economically.]

A History of Seven Mid-Northern Hundreds

The publishing committee of the Terowie Branch of the CWA advises its publication Deceptive Lands: a History of Seven Mid-Northern Hundreds, will be released before Christmas at a cost of $5.  The Author is Roma Mattey (now Mrs Hans Schultz).  It is an attempt to cover the early pastoral history of the Hundreds of Terowie, Whyte Yarcowie, Wonna, Gumbowie, Ketchowla, Yongala and Parnaroo.

All surveyed towns in the area except Peterborough have been described and there are many historic photographs in the book of over 250 pages.  The foreword is by His Excellency W.R. Crocker, now Australian Ambassador in Rome.  He spent his early childhood at Parnaroo.

Burra Swimming Pool.  The season was opened last Saturday.  About 30 keen swimmers braved conditions a little colder than desired.  Norm Lihou has the filtration system working well.  Mr Stan Kellaway is taking care of the vacuuming of the pool.  Other tasks concerning the pool and canteen have been rostered.

The Hospital Department has increased Burra Town Council’s contribution to the Burra Hospital from $973 to $1,373 – a 41% increase.  The Council is strongly objecting, as this has occurred after the budget for 1968-69 has been prepared and the rate declared.  The Hospital Board has not requested an increase in contributions.  Increases have not been ordered for the Burra Burra DC, the Robertstown or the Hallett Councils.

Ian Auhl’s Address: Burra The Anatomy of a National Trust Town is printed.

[Auhl begins by talking about the problem of Burra’s name as a town and the Burra of the Five Towns – choosing as his five Kooringa, Copperhouse, Redruth, Aberdeen and Hampton.  He goes on to speak of how it is still in some ways three towns – Kooringa, Aberdeen and Redruth.  He goes along with the story of ‘the early separation of the towns upon distinct nationalistic lines – Cornish, English and Welsh.  For nearly 20 years there was no direct road for traffic between the northern and southern towns.  He then says that there was no Corporation or Council of Burra until after the mines closed in 1877.  This is such a bad error that it is hard to believe that Auhl would have said it and it casts doubt on the authenticity of the text – though it is early in the period of his historical research.  He also says that only two hotels were allowed to operate inside the Mining Association’s area.  This is another error which it is hard to believe Auhl would have made.  The Burra Hotel, the Miners’ Arms and the Pig & Whistle operated in Kooringa for a long period and for shorter periods there were also others.  The Commercial Hotel also began operation near the end of the mining period.  In addition the Smelters’ Home, while at Burra North, was still within the Mining Association’s area.  He goes on to discuss how the Mining Association kept the railway outside their section and to talk of the term ‘The Burra’, supposing it to be a contraction of ‘The Burra Mine’, given that the name did not then apply to the town properly speaking.

He considers that the focal point for Burra: an Historical Town is the old mining area and its destruction would destroy any prima facie case for Burra as an Historic Town.  The retention of the unity of the town is also important.  He draws a distinction between a place of the past and a place with a past.  Burra is definitely the latter.  Burra once saved a struggling SA from bankruptcy and he believes it is now time for SA to save Burra.

History, for Historic Towns, must be more than interesting, it must be important and to attract money that importance must be at the state level, not merely parochially.  Time, he says, is running out.  Auhl then goes on to acknowledge the National Trust Museum, but considers it more important to see the town itself as the museum.]

Burra’s claims, he considers, are:

Except for Kapunda it is the oldest mining town in Australia.  Kapunda began in 1842-43 and Burra two years later.  Coppermania was the predecessor of gold fever in the eastern states.  When gold was first discovered near Bathurst Kapunda had a population of 1,000 and Burra one of 5,000.  There were deserted mining villages in SA before there were any mining camps in NSW or Victoria.

Mere age is, however, not enough; the town must be capable of survival.  Kapunda the mining town, survived, but it has been much outgrown by Kapunda the agricultural centre.  Burra, unfortunately for its growth and development, remained isolated and its population declined from 5,000 in 1850 to 3,000 in 1877 to now 1,000 or so and it has tended to make use of what buildings it had.  When the mine closed it became a forgotten town, struggling to survive – almost a frontier town on the edge of Goyder’s Line, with empty saltbush plain to its east.  The district turned from mining to wheat and sheep and from that to stud breeding.

Another reason for its survival has been its physical solidity.  Knocking things down has been an Australian pastime.  Burra buildings are solidly built of a hard carbonaceous shale, which splits easily, but presents a face which withstands weathering.  The mine buildings at Burra have withstood neglect, time and weather much better that the limestone structures at Kadina and Wallaroo.  Progress which involves the modernisation of shop fronts etc. is not necessarily progress in a tourist town.

‘It is my firm belief that Burra’s biggest business lies in its possibilities as an historic town.  The destruction or radical alteration of its buildings to me constitutes the destruction of its assets.’

Auhl thought the Burra Town Council more far sighted in this respect than most others.  Of course Burra will need modern buildings and institutions, such as for its hospital and school and a motel, but it does not need modernisation of its existing buildings, which are the very assets of its future.

Happily Burra has largely used the buildings it had and its walls are largely intact, though some are sadly neglected.  Hardly any street of sector of the town lacks the sort of place which a visitor cannot find with delight.

The isolation of Burra has, in large measure, been responsible for its preservation, but this is at complete variance with its early history, when it was the economic heart of the colony.  Many towns on the Copper Road and from Gawler to Burra grew around the wayside inns marking the end of a day’s journey for the bullock teams to and from Burra.

The history of Burra is visual rather than written.  There are very few living in Burra who could remember even the closing of the mines.  Few locals know the story of their town and fewer realise its significance.  Since the visit of the Adelaide National Trust to Burra there has been some revival of interest and a subsequent tour for local people brought an almost overwhelming attendance.

Written History

When Burra’s history comes to be written it will almost be the history of SA for 1845-60.  It took ten years for SA’s population to reach 20,000, but in the following four years it jumped to 60,000.  By 1848 its mineral exports were £320,000 out of a total of £465,000.  Shipping increased from 10,000 tons in 1844 to 80,000 tons four years later.  At times the mine had 6,000 bullocks on the road, with at least 1,000 drivers and drays.  Burra’s population was 5,000 when Adelaide’s was 20,000.  This history remains to be told, though Geoffrey Blainey made a beginning in his book The Rush that Never Ended.

Vandalism

The slow vandalism of time and weather has had little impact on Burra’s native stone buildings. The vandalisms of individuals, often thoughtless, but sometimes deliberate or inspired by greed, or sometimes almost sadistic, have had their effect.  There is also the vandalism of indifference.  This is the most dangerous, as it allows the other forms to go unchecked.  This cannot be checked without the help of Acts of Parliament.

There is also the vandalism of snobbery, which believes a mansion is intrinsically more worthy of preservation than the houses of common people.  To me the preservation of the miners’ huts in the Burra Creek is as important as the preservation of Ayers’ House.  Let us remember that the former preceded and were responsible for the latter.  Country museums have a bad habit of beginning to look alike.

‘And a natural corollary of a museum in a town is plaques in the rest of the town.  Nothing to me is more pathetic than a plaque.  It is a symbol of defeat.’

‘Plaques are epitaphs.’

‘A book – a record of some kind – yes!’

‘This type of preservation is the basis of National Histories and the flesh of our National bones.’

‘Buildings lead to questions – and questions lead to research – and research leads to preservation.’

[Auhl then goes on to say he has been encouraged by the responses he has had to requests to Government Departments.  He says while the National Trust has as yet no access to Government funds, Councils and Corporations have, through Tourist Grants.  This means working with the Tourist Bureau.]

The Town Planning Act has yet to be tested as far as historic towns and their buildings are concerned, but the 1965 Aboriginal and Historic Relics Act is perhaps the most hopeful piece of legislation.  Local business organisations take even more convincing than politicians, but once convinced are the most useful and energetic of the lot.

‘If…as I believe that Burra did indeed save the young South Australia, surely it is not too much to ask South Australia to now save Historic Burra.’

Ian Auhl writes in response to remarks made by E.C. Allen MP when opening the Burra Show, when he mentioned the possibility of a short term re-opening of the old Burra Mine:

While the facts given by Mr Allen are no doubt correct, there are many unanswered questions in people’s minds.  Mr Allen does not know the town well enough to realise that the short term future he envisages is in direct conflict with its long term future role as a tourist town and Australia’s oldest mining area.  If what was being offered was another Mt Isa or even a new Burra Mine there would be no doubt about the benefits, though even then some would no doubt regret the passing of the old mine area.  Bur exactly what will Burra (or SA) gain by the destruction of the old mine area and all its buildings – by the destruction of an area unique in Australia and which is Burra’s central asset as a tourist attraction?  Mt answer is, it would be exchanging its unique heritage for a mess and not for any real gain.  Among the questions that need to be answered are:

What percentage of copper does the 3.4 million tons of ore body contain?  The correct answer, I believe, is an average 1%.

How much of this 1% can be extracted by present processes?  About 60%.  So the useful part of the ore is about 0.5%.  This would be unprofitable at present, even with the high price of copper.  An efficient metallurgical process would apparently make it profitable by managing to extract another 0.25%.  We are not told what the profits of the mine would amount to, but surely they would be marginal.

Who would profit?  Mainly the shareholders of Broken Hill South of which Mines Exploration Ltd is a subsidiary company.

What would Burra get out of this?  Extra trade as the result of employing some 35 or so men.  Other benefits have not been specified.

Where would they be housed?  Perhaps in company caravans or units, as they have been for the past few years or perhaps on Housing Trust land near the Redruth Gaol.

Past experience suggests they would be single men.

Would they be Burra men?  It is not stated.

What houses would be affected?  What area of the town would the open cut affect?  What would be the length and width of the open cut?  Would it be about ¾ mile long by ¼ mile wide and 500 ft deep?

What effect would the pumping have on the Burra watertable?

Would any of the ore body be processed in Burra?  Or would it be transported 600 miles to Cobar for processing?

Is there any indication that after a maximum of ten years mining there would be any permanent benefit for Burra?

Some twelve months ago I mentioned these questions to an officer of Mines Exploration Ltd and spoke of the relative value to Burra of such a small mining venture compared with the value of the town’s long term tourist possibilities.  The answer was ‘So what?’ as if this could be of no concern to the people of Burra and was evidently of little concern to someone chasing a quick quid.

Is Mr Allen aware that the Corporation of Burra owns the mine area and the mineral rights?

What compensation is likely to be paid whether the mine opens or not?

Is Mr Allen aware that Mines Exploration Ltd used the old powder magazine for storing bags of samples and this has resulted in the cracking of the roof of this, the oldest mine building in Australia?

Does Mr Allen know the company fenced around the chief tourist attraction – Graves’ Shaft and Engine House?  Was permission sought or given for these acts?  What compensation arrangements have been made for the loss of the mining area and its buildings or for damage done?  Is the establishment of a small mining venture in the heart of a town really wanted?  Id Burra needs a boost it is already getting one from the growing tourist traffic and the value to the town of thousands of tourists will be much greater than the value of an additional 35 men or so for a maximum of ten years.  Various Governments have spent a considerable sum in exploring the mine area, but the answer is a doubtful one and of comparatively little value to Burra itself.  This apparent boost could be more of a kick in the pants than a shot in the arm.  I would like to see a public meeting to give the people of Burra a chance to express their opinions and ask their own questions on the matter of Burra’s future.

Burra CWA has donated a further $56 towards a new centre carpet for the Town Hall.

The Tourist Bureau has ruled that the Council should meet the small extra cost of the Caravan Park.

The Hospital Department advises of an increase of $400 or 41% in payment due to the Burra Hospital by the Council: and increase from $973 to $1373.  The Department is to be advised that with the budget adopted and the rate declared by the Council is at a loss to know where they are to get the increase and also drawing attention to the reduction in rates allowed to the hospital for many years.  A copy of this letter will also be sent to C. Allen MP.  If necessary he will be asked to arrange for a deputation on the matter to the Chief Secretary, Mr De Garis.

The Minister of Tourism complains about the public toilets in Burra.  He is to be advised that they are cleaned each morning.

The Department of Agriculture advises a further subsidy of $70 for noxious weed control, for a total of $115.

E.C. Allen’s Bomb

On 27 September a parcel bomb was addressed to E.C. Allen MP for Burra at Parliament House, Adelaide.  It had been posted in a letter box in Adelaide in the afternoon of 27thand delivered to Mr Allen at Parliament House. Believing it to be a parcel of goods his wife had purchased at John Martin’s, because of a label on it, he took it home to Spalding without opening it.  Mrs Allen opened the parcel slowly and the bomb, which was exposed when she removed the lid of the box, failed to explode.  CIB members attended with the Army bomb disposal squad and rendered the bomb harmless.  It was in a parcel 6 inches x 2½ inches x 2½ inches.  It was rigged so that a Schermuly ‘Mars’ hand flare connected to a .243 Metallverken make cartridge would trigger gelignite.  Scientists discovered that dust on the wood in the bomb has come from the Burra North area.  Detectives have been conducting investigations in the area from 12 November and the Government has offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of the sender.

Burra Golf Club AGM was held 7 November.

The year had been a social and financial success.  All scrapes had received a heavy coating of slag, which served well.  A major project saw additions to the clubhouse and toilets, to enable the club to get a permit for refreshments.  Open day drew over 100 entries.  Club Champion this year was Hartley Strawbridge.  The heavy expenditure had left the club in debt, but this position was righted by members paying subscriptions in advance.  Elected were President, John Gordon; Vice-Presidents, R. Mason & I. McWaters; Captain, S. Longford; Vice-Captain, J. Bogisch, Treasurer, J. Bonython and Secretary, R. Jeffery.

Burra Mine.

[E.C. Allen writes seeking to clarify the implications of the possible re-opening of the Burra Mine.]

Too many assumptions have been made by people not in possession of the facts.  On 10 January 1966 the then Minister of Mines Hon. S.C. Bevan MLC advised Mines Exploration Ltd of his acceptance of their proposal to explore the area.  Both the present and the previous Government have placed much emphasis on mineral exploration in SA to directly help state income.  Indicated reserves at Burra are 3.3 million tons of possible ore at an average 1.6% copper.  The problem of how much of this can be extracted is being investigated.  Consequently it is not yet possible to say how much the mine would be worth – a figure also affected by changing copper prices.  A rough estimate, however, suggests that 3.3 million tons yielding 1% copper at the present price of $1,000 per ton would realise $33 million.  Some 60-70 men would be directly employed with a payroll of about $5,000 per week or $260,000 per year.  As many local men as were available would be employed and housing would be built as needed – men would not live in caravans or units.  No homes would be affected by the possible open pits, the largest of which would finally be 1,100 feet x 750 ft and the smaller 800 ft x 300 ft, separated by some 300 ft and the deepest would be some 300 ft in depth.  Experience suggests the water table would not be affected except in the immediate mine area.  Ore would be treated to the concentration stage at Burra, as otherwise transportation cost would be prohibitive.  I asked a question in the House on 28 November to see if provision could be made when laying the natural gas pipeline through Gum Creek and Leighton areas, for a later connection to Burra.  Arrangements were completed some time ago with the Corporation to realign the fence in the Graves’ Shaft area to allow access to the shaft (the cost to be borne by Mines Exploration Ltd.) and this has been attended to.  It is expected the life of operations would be 10-15 years.  I have no doubt that both mining activities and tourist activities could work together.  The Department of Mines Exploration have expressed a keen desire to do everything possible to preserve the early relics of mining in this area and I have been given to understand they would be prepared to remove and re-erect any of the buildings considered to be of value.  I have supplied a map showing the extent of the proposed operations.

Burra Mine

Mr Allen MP recently asked in Parliament whether there will be provision made for natural gas to be supplied from the pipeline to Burra.  Premier Hon. R.S. Hall undertook to bring the matter to the notice of the Minister of Mines and to get a reply.  The reply was that while technical problems re the economic recovery of the copper remain to be solved the question is somewhat academic, but there is no doubt that if the economics justify it, gas could be made available.

Burra High School Speech Night was held last Monday night.  Headmaster Farrow expressed his concern at falling enrolments.  The Mayor and Mayoress, Mr Allen MP & Mrs Allen, Chairman of the District Council Cr G. Finch & Mrs Finch, Miss Sprat Headmistress of Burra Primary School and the religious instruction teachers attended.  The guest speaker was Mr White.

The post war boom and raising the school leaving age led to increased school enrolments, but now the increasing size of farm holdings and migration out of the mid-north to other areas is presenting the school with a period of stability, or even of decline.  The year started with 170 students and finished with 150 – the smallest for some years.  The loss of 20 students during the year is perhaps of more concern than the overall decline.  The 1967 exam results were particularly pleasing with 90% satisfying subject grades in PEB Intermediate and Leaving.  All candidates presenting for the Alternative Certificate (Internal Intermediate Course) were successful.  We congratulate Christopher Freeman who gained 7 subjects with 6 grade 1 passes.  He won an Intermediate Bursary.  Malcolm White and Andrew Ryan were awarded Intermediate Continuation Scholarships.

Recently three students were given Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships based on special examinations taken in July this year: Lynette Griffen, Angela Quinn and Chrystine Steele.  In 1969 the Intermediate Certificate, both internal and external, will be abolished.  The path to University matriculation will also be modified.  The new Junior Secondary Curriculum will provide a challenge to all.  We should guard against judging what a child is asked to do by some vocational yard stick.  Life is big and marvellous and to be enjoyed.  Our concept of it needs to be panoramic and not narrow and hazy.  But the school is not all hard work.  The extra-curricular life is rich and rewarding.  Burra High School has provided the breadth of sport, travel, club, social and involvement in other worthy causes.  I am concerned that on leaving school in country areas like Burra there is something of a dearth of such wider experiences in the community – a lack of cultural groups, of adult education, recognised community groups and projects.  Parents too have a role to play.  There have been instances this year of incidents of deliberate mischief.  If your child has access to a vehicle, make sure it is for legitimate purposes and is handled properly.  If the child has access to a phone at will, should they?  If a child is involved in an incident away from school premises don’t blame the school.  Nine times out of ten it is the parents’ upbringing of the child which is at fault.  And if you are the type to blame the school, don’t then turn around and blame the staff if they do take action.

We are once again very grateful to the Parents & Friends’ Association and the High School Council for all the amenities provided and improvements made.

The triennial election for the School Council in June saw Mr D.H. Field re-appointed as Chairman; Mr T.G. Perry as Secretary and Mr R.B. Jennison as Treasurer.  Thanks to Mr D. White, who has been Acting Secretary while Mr Perry has been overseas.  The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. has been led by President Mrs F. Matthews with Mrs B. Bevan Secretary and Mrs P. Carpenter as Treasurer.  It has sponsored the annual ball, catered for sports day and will on 18 December provide the usual annual banquet.  This year they have provided a portable amplifier, new tennis nets, additions to the library and a television receiver.  The Government has made improvements to school buildings and there is a project to have a recreation room for students.

Thanks are extended to Mrs Cockington for playing the accompaniment for the Girls’ Choir and to Mrs Carpenter for leading them.  Also to the religious instruction staff for doing so well a job that is all too often thankless.

[Mr Farrow went on to thank a variety of people, to wish departing students well and to farewell some staff members.]

Six staff members are known to be leaving:

Miss Newman to Mannum

Mr Murphy to Angle Park Boys’ Technical High School

Mr Schwartz to Norwood

Mr Alfred to Daws Road

And Mrs Day has been promoted to Acting Senior Mistress.

Burra National Trust held its AGM recently and elected: President, L. Moore; Vice-President, S.J. Woollacott; Secretary, Mrs C .O’Connor and Treasurer, R. Broad.

The retiring President S.J .Woollacott reported on a year when the Museum had been a success.  Thanks go to Ian Auhl for bringing Burra to the fore with his pen and the Mayor Mr Baulderstone, who has done so much to bring Burra’s tourist possibilities to the notice of those in authority.  The drive down Commercial Street to Market Square and thence to Burra North reveals a town that has more attractions than any other of a similar size.  Now we need to make the rest of the town as attractive.  Here the Council can assist in keeping the place tidy and in properly caring for the trees.  Success requires money and that requires an income from customers.  During the year the Museum had over 1,000 paying adults and received over $100.  We note with regret the passing of Mr Robert Fuss who was a good and practical citizen and we are grateful for the services he rendered the Trust.

After the business section of the meeting Mr Hans Mincham gave an illustrated lecture on the Flinders Ranges.

Weather.  Yesterday was hot and windy, but overnight 52 points of rain were recorded and reaping has had to be suspended for the time being.

Accident.  At about 11.30 p.m. on Friday a semi-trailer owned by S.E. Schulz of Renmark and driven by Peter E. Size of Renmark overturned on the Burra North-Morgan Road near Basin Farm.  It was taking 240 wethers for Elders-GM from Peterborough to Loxton.  Attending police worked till 3.30 a.m. freeing sheep from the bottom tray.  70 head of stock were killed or had to be destroyed.  The driver was kept in Burra Hospital over night for observation and was severely bruised.  Another truck picked up the sheep on Saturday morning and the District Council plant pulled the vehicle back onto its wheels.  Damage is estimated at $3,000.

Obituary.  William Joseph Lee was born at Marrabel 13 January 1883 and moved with his family to live at World’s End when 13 years old.  He began school at Marrabel and finished it at World’s End.  He then became a blacksmith and farrier’s apprentice at Riverton and later came to Burra to work for the late Sam Burns for 11 years.  When that business closed he worked for Mr Max Morton, after which he went into business on his own and retired after about 20 years.  In 1909 he married Miss Julia Barrow.  He became a member of the Foresters’ Lodge in 1911 and was its secretary for many years, retiring from the position at 80 years of age.  He became a member of the Kooringa Masonic Lodge in 1929 and was Grand Master [sic: for Worshipful Master] in 1945.  He became a member of the Grand Lodge in 1960.  He was a member of the Burra Brass Band, Burra Institute Library and foreman of the Burra Fire Brigade for several years.  He is survived by a wife and children: Cliff (Kalgoorlie), Ilene Mrs Campbell (Burra), Robert (Charters Towers, Qld), Ron (Townsville, Qld), Joyce Mrs D. Pexton (Poolaijelo, Victoria) and Phyllis Mrs McWaters (Melbourne).  [Died 27 November 1968 Burra.]

Characteristics of the paper in 1968

In general a good coverage of local news, though local extends to Spalding and Hallett and south towards Riverton.  Council matters are perhaps less revealing than in some periods, but a mostly reported adequately.

Page 1

Almost entirely local news with 1 or 2 advertisements.

Page 2

Usually dominated by large advertisements for perhaps one third and then by public notices and the like – but proportions fluctuate considerably and there is sometimes a news story as well.

Page 3

Important snippets of what is going on locally and news about past and present resident in very brief form in ‘Out & About’ column.  Births, deaths and marriages tend to get at least a brief mention, making this an important record, though often lacking useful details.  Large advertisements occupy about half the page or more.

Page 4

About half the page is occupied by large advertisements.  The rest is news and items of general interest.

Page 5

Large advertisements occupy perhaps three-quarters of the page with the rest the 50 years Ago Column.

But note that pages 4 & 5 are somewhat interchangeable in content.

Pages 6 & 7

Large advertisements and sports, which is the dominant news on this page, though not limited to it. The ‘Cash Column’ of small advertisements is usually on one of these pages, but can wander elsewhere.

Page 8

This is a mixture of advertisements of varying size for some 4 of the 7 columns.  The rest is the overflow of sport and general news and items of general interest.

Supplements were not frequent, but overflow was often accommodated by printing in the gutters.  This was usually in the 306 gutter, but sometimes in 4-5 gutters and occasionally in the 207 gutter and sometimes in more than one of them.

The supplement on 26 November was larger than a full-sized page and was an advertisement celebrating Sargasso’s 10th birthday – the Burra Agent was Guy Dollman’s Burra Motor Co.  It featured four colour printing and was folded into quarters.

Burra Silos wheat intake to yesterday equals the record 1966-67 season of 295,000 bushels.  It began a fortnight later, with the first delivery on 10 December when Mr Graham Heinrich of World’s End and then Mr Gordon Webster of Springbank delivered a load and deliveries here have been more concentrated this year.  A number of farmers have already delivered their quotas of 75% of their harvest.  Some have decided to bag the other 25%, while most have converted to bulk storage.  Burra has the capacity to stack 17,000 bags and Norm Maxted of Mt Bryan delivered the first bags on Friday.  Not much remains locally to be reaped.

Obituary.  The body of Mr George Alfred Crawford, the Saddleworth District Clerk, was found about 300 yards from his car on a seldom used road in the Belvedere Range about three miles due east of the town on 11 January.

Burra Town Council, 18 December

The Town Clerk reports on a meeting with the Minister of Local Government about the merged Council.  It seems certain that the appointment of a Mayor for the new Council in 1969 will be by nomination of the ratepayers.  The first step towards amalgamation has been a Notice of Amalgamation published in the Government Gazette and local paper.

The Town Hall Pictures showed a loss in November of $15 with an average attendance of 90.  Three nights ran at a loss and two shows in December also ran at a loss of $18 to give a loss over seven weeks of $33.

A window has been broken in the Camera Club room and is to be replaced.

Mr Perry has been appointed Acting Town Clerk.

Amalgamation of Councils

No objections have been received to the proposed union of the Burra Burra District Council and the Town Council and the period for objections has now passed.

The area of the proposed union will be divided into nine wards: Burra Town, Kooringa, Baldina, Booborowie, Leighton, Mt Bryan, Mongolata, Farrell Flat and Hanson.  Each ward except Burra Town is to have one Councillor, with Burra Town to have three.  Provision is to be made for the election of a Mayor as in the Corporation.  Assessments will be on the basis of unimproved land values.  There has been no call for a poll of ratepayers and so the petition has been drawn up and will be signed and sealed at a special combined meeting of the two Councils tonight.  It is hoped that the proclamation of the union will enable the combined Councils to sit as one commencing in April.  This would give time for the preparation of and the calling of nominations for Councillors for all wards to form the new Council to operate from 1 July 1969.  The February and March meetings of both Councils will remain divided.  A Bill to amend the Local Government Act 1934-67 to cover the election of a Mayor under circumstances similar to those which exist here will go before the Legislative Council when it sits next.  It is anticipated that a Mayor for the whole area will be elected by ratepayers and in turn be appointed Chairman of the Council.  Previously it had been understood the Mayor would be elected by ratepayers and a Chairman elected by Council.  With Mr T.G. Perry acting as Town Clerk all business of the Town Council is being conducted from the District Council Office in Commercial Street.

Adelaide Wool Sales 14-16 January.  Prices were similar to those in December.  [Local district prices are printed.]

Wheat.  With trading of bulk wheat delayed, the bagged wheat at Burra has amounted to 11,000 bags.  Some trucks with bulk wheat have lined up for a fortnight with no immediate prospect of rail trucks to clear the silos.

Weather.  A line of thunderstorms on Thursday dumped heavy falls across the district.  A half mile wide strip of North Booborowie was flooded when 2 inches fell in half an hour.  Terowie reported another deluge.  Leighton also received heavy rain.  At Hanson and Farrell Flat falls varied from 60-70 points.  Erratic falls are reported from the east; Old Koomooloo 15 points, Koomooloo 2 points at the homestead, but over 200 on the western end of the property.  Woolgangi received 40 points.  The Booborowie deluge included hail, some of which was the size of pigeons’ eggs and creeks ran eight feet deep.  Fencing was swept away.  Damage to fallow was extensive, but areas of flooded lucerne will benefit.  The trench for the gas pipeline became a flowing stream and quite a deal of clean-up is needed.  Booborowie post office officially registered 120 points.

Burra Sketch Book

It is expected this book will contain about 24 original sketches by Burra architect Maurice Perry, accompanied by explanatory text by local historian Ian Auhl.  Burra Branch of the National Trust is sponsoring the book and will receive Mr Auhl’s share of the profits.  Mr Perry will be paid a reasonable sum for the use of his sketches.

[The Burra Railway Station sketch is reproduced.]

Burra Railway Station: the first train steamed into the station at 12.45 p.m. on 27 August 1870. [actually 29 August]  It carried eight carriages and 400 passengers, without distinction of class or other distinction.  Fifteen minutes later the select train bearing H.E. Sir James Fergusson, Lady Fergusson and other dignitaries arrived, hauled by a decorated engine.  The engine had made the 100 mile journey in five hours.  Three thousand locals were on hand to greet it and the town was enjoying a public holiday.  Welcoming archways had been erected.  The station and goods shed had been festooned with greenery, which must have occasioned havac [sic] on the trees for 15 miles around.  Feasting went on all day.    The official luncheon with speeches in the goods shed lasted so long that the Vice-Regal party had only time for a quick tour round the town before departing at 4.50 p.m.  On the return there was a delay at Farrell Flat when the train ran over [and killed] a signalman sho was to have waved the red flag at the crossing.

At Burra the celebrations continued with a concert in the Lodge Room of the Burra Hotel, followed by a ball till dawn.  The twelve hotels [?] remained open all night.  Bonfires were lit up and down the street.

The transportation of ores had been a problem for SAMA since the mine opened in 1845, when the colony had no railways.  Bullock drays at first took the ore to Pt Adelaide via Kapunda, for shipment to Swansea in Wales.  Later, from 1847, the road to Pt Wakefield shortened the journey by 30 miles, but was so difficult through the hills that the company tried replacing the bullock drays with pack mules – hundreds being brought from Montevideo with Spanish-American muleteers.  Towns grew up along the route, but both the route and the towns were abandoned by the Smelting Company in 1857 when the railway reached Gawler.  When the railway arrived at Kapunda in August 1860 the old copper road to Kapunda was resumed.  The Burra Burra Mine was almost exhausted by the time the first rain reached Burra in 1870.

Accident.  A vehicle driven by Alfred Thomas Mildred of Somerton Park, who was travelling to Broken Hill, overturned on the old Black Springs Road at about 8.50 on Saturday morning.  It rolled over three times.  The driver and his wife Colleen were both wearing seat belts and were saved from serious injury.  The vehicle, only six weeks old, was a write off.

On Sunday at c. 1.30 a.m. Mr Allen Hutchins of Ridgehaven was travelling to Broken Hill to visit his seriously ill mother when, about two miles south of Burra, he was dazzled by oncoming headlights on high beam.  In avoiding the vehicle the car rolled over.  He suffered concussion and should and neck injuries.  The damage to the car was relatively minor.

Accident.  Two trainee nurses travelling to Burra were involved in a collision with another vehicle at Saddleworth on Saturday morning.  They were Norma Alvena Palmer and Rosemary Brown.  The Morris Mini was considerably damaged.

Paxton Square was declared an Historic Reserve under the Aboriginal & Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965, on 9 January 1969.  William Paxton was a Hindley Street Chemist.  In 1845 he and three other Hindley Street businessmen formed a company to light Adelaide streets with gas.  The scheme was quickly shelved when one of them, Thomas Bunce, shared the news he had of the discovery of copper on the Burra Creek.  A shepherd named Streair had come to Adelaide and traded his knowledge of it for £8.  Paxton invested £140 in the get-rich-quick scheme and became one of the first directors of the new SA Mining Association.  The shop-keeping nobodies were wealthy men within two years and the Burra Burra Mine became a bonanza.

Paxton acquired a number of choice sites in the private town of Kooringa and soon owned the hotels: the Burra and the Miners’ Arms (now called the Burra Hotel).  One of his properties on the east side of the creek became known as Paxton’s Square, though when he sold it the only building on it was the Bible Christian Chapel, now Baulderstone’s storeroom.  The Mining Association acquired it from him in 1852 and engaged Cornish masons to erect 33 cottages on three sides.  The eleven cottages on each side enclosed common land for the tenants.  The cottages were erected to house Cornish deep miners brought out especially from Cornwall in the 1850s to work the deeper lodes where water was a problem.  Each had two or three rooms with floors of packed clay and cost 5/- a week.  When SA Mining Association went into liquidation in 1914 the cottages were acquired by John Lewis, then of the Burra stock and station firm of Liston, Shakes & Lewis.

[Note: the cottages were passed in at auction in October 1912 and Lewis purchased them towards the end of 1913.]

Lewis later became Hon. John Lewis MLC, Father of Essington Lewis the great industrialist.

[Actually Lewis was already an MLC, serving in the SA Legislative Council 1898-1923.]

Mrs Jane Melrose of Kadlunga, Mintaro, is a daughter.

In March 1923 Paxton Square was incorporated into a trust by Lewis who arranged for it to be managed by a Board of Management.  Hon. John Lewis died a few months later.  [25 August 1923]

The cottages were to house the poor and needy of Burra.  The trustees for many years were Stanley Kellaway, Isaac Warnes & Mrs Jane Melrose.  In 1968it was being administered by members of the Lewis family: Mr R. Lewis, Mrs Melrose & Mrs J. Gosse.  Until last year Mr Stan Kellaway Jnr acted as Curator for the Lewis Trust.

Following a meeting between representatives of the Burra Town Council and the Burra National Trust early in 1968 a common approach was made to the Lewis Trust to consider the appointment of local trustees.  The meeting was chaired by R.B. Lewis and considered ways of bringing the cottages up to an acceptable standard while still fulfilling the original purpose of the trust.  It was realised that Paxton Square could not be sold nor the trust dissolved without a special act of Parliament.

It was decided to bring some cottages up to standard while respecting their original external features.  New trustees were appointed, with Rev. G.D. Sibly as Chairman and the Board of Management was enlarged to include local trustees: Mr R. Jennison, Mr L. Phillips, Mr G. Finch, Mr S. Woollacott, Rev. G.D. Sibly and Mr E.T. Baulderstone.  A plan of modernisation was drawn up by S.J. Woollacott, who has already made substantial improvements to the living amenities of the cottages.  He is the present curator.

Realising their important significance in Australia’s mining story, Mr Ian Auhl submitted an application in 1968 to the Board administering the Historic Relics Act, asking that Paxton square be proclaimed an Historic Reserve.  He was supported by representatives of the Lewis family.  At a meeting of the Lewis Trust in Burra the Secretary of the Relics Board, Mr R. Edwards, acting on behalf of the Board and the Protector of Relics, Dr Inglis, asked the trustees to consider giving their support to the move and they agreed.  The application was also endorsed by Mr Dean Berry, President of the Sa National Trust.

Professor Geoffrey Blainey also lent his support.  Paxton Square is the first building in SA to be proclaimed an Historic Reserve under the Act.  The present trustees are appointed Wardens under the Act.  More and more people in Burra as well as those who study Australia’s pioneering past are realising that Burra has a whole series of buildings which make the town unique in SA.

Fires.  On Friday a fire burnt 50 acres of stubble on the property of Mr Ken Phillips of World’s End.  A number of sheep in the paddock were moved to safety.  In the clam conditions it is thought to have been slowly burning for about two hours before being noticed as about 3 a.m.

On Saturday it was discovered that a fire on the property of P.J. Thomas east of World’s End had burnt itself out in clam conditions.  Quite a lot of fencing was destroyed before the fire halted at a well-used track.  There is evidence that a person or persons were in the vicinity at the time.

Burra Mine

Through the efforts of Mr Ian Auhl, Mr Alister Colebatch, a surveyor for ETSA and Mr Claude Allen MP it has been confirmed that the Burra Town Council owns the mineral rights to the Mine site.  It has been understood for many years that the mineral rights were owned by Mr P.A.M. McBride, even after the purchase of the property by the Corporation in 1960.  Searches through various Departmental records have now satisfied Mr Auhl and Mr Colebatch that the rights lie with the Town Council.  It was arranged through the Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone that they attend a meeting of Council to pass on the news of this discovery.  This was done on 27 May last year and it was then resolved that establishment of the ownership of the mineral rights be obtained from the Minister of Mines.  No answer had been obtained when Mr Allen spoke on the possible re-opening of the Burra Mine when he opened the Burra Show.  This prompted a letter to the Record from Mr Ian Auhl in which he asked among other questions whether the MP was aware that the mineral rights belonged to the Town Council and if so what compensation they could expect.  Mr Allen replied in a letter published on 3 December which addressed a number of the questions, but not that related to mineral rights; apparently because there remained some doubt about it.  We now have a letter from Mr Allen with a response from the Minister of Mines.

The area of rights so far as the Corporation is concerned covers the whole of the open cut section and area to the west and south.  Mr Allen has asked what progress has been made on the metallurgical problem.

Hon. R.S. Hall replied that for the period to 31 December 1968 three independent avenues of research are being pursued and the company (Mines Exploration Pty Ltd) said it would probably take six months to finalise these investigations and the Department is confident that the company is doing its best to find a satisfactory solution.

Mt Bryan & Hallett Water Scheme

Mr Allen MP undertook to look into the report on the proposed water scheme for Mt Bryan and Hallett made by the E & WS Department.  The Department found that such a scheme would not be practical.  The towns are too small to recover even the interest on the capital invested.  Clare for example used 90 million gallons in 1967-68 and the cost of getting water pumped from Farrell Flat to Clare was 75 cents per 1,000 gallons.  Burra receives water pumped from Hanson and used 41 million gallons at a cost of $1.05 per 1,000 gallons.  The Minister of Works states the cost of supplying River Murray water to Mt Bryan would be $175,000.  If all landowners between Mt Bryan and Burra paid the normal rate of 27c per acre on all land within one mile of the pipeline the revenue would be c. $3,456.  Rates from the town would not bring in more than $1,000.  This would represent 2½% interest on the capital cost and this does not include the actual cost of pumping or general maintenance.  Some landowners are not prepared to contribute so the Minister is correct in saying it is impracticable.  An alternative local source is also full of difficulties.  Good supplies of [bore] water are available, but are too poor for use in hot water systems.  Also, if supplied, all vacant blocks would be rateable for the minimum rates of $8 per year.

The Minister of Works said the matter had been investigated following a petition from landowners between Mt Bryan and Burra for Murray water to be extended to Mt Bryan with a pipe of sufficient size to enable later extension to Hallett.  Two pumping stations and two tanks would be needed.  The proposal needs 10 miles of 8 inch main and a 100,000 gallon surface tank at Mt Bryan.  Expenditure of $170,000 to reach Mt Bryan and a further $145,000 to include Hallett.  Three landowners indicated intention to irrigate lucerne.  All properties have adequate stock water supplies and it is unsound for the E & WS to provide Murray water for lucerne irrigation.  Neither scheme can be justified.  A report on the likelihood of obtaining supplies from bores in Mt Bryan area has been asked for.

The club has grown too large for Mrs Allen’s house and has had to move elsewhere.  Financial members are 25 compared with 17 last year and the average attendance is 15.  The club now has a library and a store and the club was invited by the Burra Town Council to represent them at the Adelaide Flower Day.  The arrangement created by Mrs Lloyd and Mrs Pettet was so impressive it was recreated in May for the club’s Floral Art Display, which enabled us to donate $90 to the Burra Town Hall Floor Appeal.

Burra Institute Library.  Mr W. Carpenter reported a difficult year.  Financial constraints have been a worry and purchasing has had to be somewhat curtailed.  Acquisition of about 100 books was balanced by discarding about 100.  At present the library holds about 6,100 adult books and 950 juvenile books.  The usual trading table netted $112.75.  Rural Youth donated $20, the Town Council $20 and the District Council $10.  Subscribers are 60; down from 70 last year.  Fifteen years ago there were 340.  Secretary Ben Kotz and Treasurer J.R. Carpenter have done an excellent job.  Mrs Baker has continued to catalogue and cover books.  Unfortunately the librarian Mrs Broad is leaving to take up duties elsewhere.  She has been an efficient librarian for some sixteen months.

Mt Bryan Wheat Growers held a meeting in the Mt Bryan Hall on 10 February to press for the erection of silos at Mt Bryan.  Present also were Mr Venning of CBH Ltd and Mr Claude Allen MP.  It was resolved that some form of temporary storage be erected at Mt Bryan and more rail trucks be made available for Burra and Hallett to help the clearance of this year’s crop.  CBH says the bountiful harvest this year has added to the problem – the harvest is about four times the previous year’s and 30 million bushels over the highest ever delivery in SA of just over 50 million bushels.  There was also about 25% carry-over from the old season, as the Wheat Board was unable to sell all of last year’s crop before this year’s harvest and even at this time some 10% of last year’s wheat remains in the silo system.  It is not the policy of the company to erect temporary storage at non-silo stations, but we can say that extensions due to be finalised at Saddleworth next September will now be completed by next month and by 20 March we will have space for an additional 330,000 bushels of wheat at Saddleworth in these new cells.  A new steel structure at Hamley Bridge will have a capacity of 70,000 bushels at about the same time.

Mr Bill Mierke addressed a meeting of farmers at Burra last week at the Burra Town Hall on the subject of nitrogen fertilizer urea.  Mr Mierke is an agronomist with Australia Pacific Fertilizer Ltd.

World’s End Methodist Church was broke into in the early hours of Sunday morning.  It had been set up on Saturday night for its Thanksgiving Service.  A window was broken and some of the produce spattered over the walls.  Vases of flowers were knocked over and some boxes of produce were found outside the church.  Members cleared up as well as they could and the service went ahead, but it lacked the usual feelings associated with thanksgiving.  Windows in a nearby unoccupied house owned by Mr Ken Phillips were also damaged by rifle bullets.

Fire.  Following a burning off operation by the railway ganger that got out of control on 10 January a meeting was held by landowners at Hallett.  The meeting requested that all landowners be notified of burning off operations, that burning off be commenced as early is the season as possible and that farmers be allowed to plough breaks on railway land to add to their protection.  The Railway Commissioner Mr Fitch replied that landowners had been notified in writing of the intent to burn off.  Burning was done as soon as possible, but the ganger had a large area to cover and burning off could not be done when fewer than four men were present.  In the Burra District the burning is done as a joint operation and the railways would be happy to extend such co-operation to the Hallett area.

Burra Primary School Welfare Club held its AGM 4 March.

Classrooms were open to inspection before the meeting.  Though it had spent over $900 for the year, it still held $450.  It was decided to put $60 towards a new Gestetner machine, to buy new sprinklers for the oval, to purchase a Freeway Sports Combination Unit and to donate $15 to each teacher for the purchase of aids etc.  Elected: President, Mrs Lola Jennison; Secretary, Mrs Avis Webster and Assistant Secretary & Treasurer Mrs Margaret Alderson.  Mrs Kirk, the retiring President, reported that the expenditure for the year had been $932 and the balance was $454.  The library received $457 worth of new books.  Service provided at the annual sports day raised $157 despite unkind weather.  Instead of a number of smaller events, money making was concentrated on the Gala Evening, which raised a nett $261.  When the new prefabricated building was completed the teachers gained a staffroom and curtains, paint, a cupboard etc. were provided by the Welfare Club.  The Club will contribute $150 towards a new amplifier, which has been ordered.  A variety of teaching aids and sports equipment has been purchased.

Burra Primary School Headmistress’s Report

1968 was a busy year.  Several sporting fixtures were held.  In Term 1 the swimming carnival was held on 23 February when Hampton House won.  The School Sports Day was held on a 19 April which was variously dusty, wet, and windy.  Aberdeen won the Gebhardt Cup.  On 22 March we entered two teams in the State Schools Swimming Championship in Adelaide.  On 3 May we fielded two tennis teams in the District Sports Day at Hallett.  The Purple Team returned with the Open Aggregate Shield and the Green Team was runner-up in the Team Games.  Interschool basketball and football games were held in Term 2.

In 1968 there was a mid-year exam and a final exam for promotional purposes.  ACER tests in reading, spelling and number processes were given in Term 1.  End of year awards went to:

Deborah Kirk & Penelope Miller gained the Andrew Tennant Award

Deborah Brand won the Most Consistent Effort Award

John Brak gained the Service to School Award.

In April each class visited the National Trust Museum in Burra.  Grade I visited the Post Office, the bakery and the Fire Station and with Grade II had a train & bus trip to Hanson.  Grades V & VI visited the Town Hall Library.  Grade V went to a shearing shed.  Junior Red Cross was active in the year and held its own fete as well as having several visiting speakers.  Grade VII produced its own magazine ‘The Monthly Review’.

Special Days observed were: Anzac Day, Pioneers’ Day, Conservation Day, World Children’s Day (featuring an austerity meal of rice) and United Nations Day (featuring clothes from other lands).

The Gale Evening saw each class present an item.  Parents too had a busy year with the Welfare Club providing sports equipment, aids for teachers, curtains, fans, cupboards and a table cloth for the staffroom and an amplifier (not yet arrived).  The Welfare Club ran stalls on Gala Night, a library service roster and donated ice creams and drinks for the children’s parties and the Swimming Carnival.  Mrs Perry was away overseas for a term and a half.  At the end of 1968 Miss McKenzie left to get married and to live in NSW and Mr John Cain has come from Western Teachers College in her place.  This year numbers have decreased to 222 at present.

[Some dates for events planned for 1969 are then given, along with some discussion of the increasing role of group work.]

Local Government Amendment Act

Some changes made will affect Local Government procedure.  Certain District Councils will be able to ask the Government to proclaim that the chief elected member be a Mayor in lieu of a Chairman.  Wives of owners of rateable property are enfranchised.  Councils will be able to set revenue aside in Reserve Funds for certain projects.  Councils will be able to proceed with schemes of development or re-development providing the scheme has been approved by the State Planning Authority.  Postal voting procedures have been revised – in particular it will be easier to find authorised witnesses.

Burraite writes on Paxton Square.  Following your recent article on Paxton Square a visit to two of the modernised renovated cottages was certainly an eye-opener.  Each has a new bathroom with electric hot water system, shower, new toilet connected to a new septic system and the quite large rooms are in excellent condition.  These flats will enable an aged pensioner couple to enjoy good living conditions as a low rental in a solid, well insulated building, cool in summer and warm in winter.  Much credit goes to Mr Stan Woollacott for getting maximum results at minimum cost.  As Paxton Square is now an Historic Reserve, the buildings cannot be pulled down, so unless an effort is made to restore them to habitable conditions, they will deteriorate into unsightly ruins.  ‘Please Burraites show your pride in your town as it is today, and also in its unique history as an early mining town, as evidenced by its many fine old buildings.

Editor:

Mr Woollacott has carried out a great deal of work not only on four of the houses, which have had the attention mentioned above, but in cleaning up the central area at the rear of the houses.  Quite a number of old toilets have been removed.  Mr Woollacott has certainly shown that as far as he is concerned he is not going to let it deteriorate further.

RSL Rooms.  It was mentioned at the RSL AGM on Friday that their billiard table is the only full-sized table in the town and it is getting very little use from members.  Not since the late George Terry conducted snooker tournaments have any organised billiards been played in the town.  Are there enough snooker players to run such a tournament?

1969 ‘Field Day’ Week for stud Merino Breeders commenced yesterday at Gawler with midday lunch at Mintaro and the day ending at Koonoona.  Today inspections are in the Hallett area, tomorrow the Mt Bryan area and at Booborowie on Friday.

Mid North Football League held its AGM 7 March.

The President B.A. Kench reported on a year of successful football competition, at times of a very high standard of play.  Auburn Club built fine dressing rooms.  Plans are in hand to resurface the Saddleworth Oval.  The Premiership went to Saddleworth-Marrabel United in the ‘A’ Grade, to Auburn in the ‘B’ Grade, and to Riverton in the Colts and also in the unofficial Junior Colts.  Permit and clearance concerns between Mid North and North Eastern were resolved, but discussions about affiliation with SANFL have a gain lapsed.  The introduction of a function for the counting of the Mail Medal Voting was a success.  Elected were: President, B.A. Kench; Vice-President, S. Noske & Patron, W.E. Blatchford.  Manoora and Mintaro Clubs are in the process of merging with Manoora agreeing and Mintaro to meet next Tuesday to confirm the decision.  Clubs nominated teams as below:

It was resolved that Junior Colts become official with an age limit of 12 years on 1 January.

It was proposed that Mintaro-Manoora United have colours red & white.

M & BHA.  Despite 39 babies attending the clinic in January and February and 30 in March, only five members attended the Association meeting in March and none of those had babies attending at present.  Money has to be raised to maintain the building, which has recently been painted at a cost of $100 and each year $100 has to be sent to Headquarters as part of the Sister’s wages.  Within the next two years $250 has to be raised as part of the cost of a small transportable house at Clare for a resident Sister for the district.  The attendance of mothers and their help is thus vital.

Mr H.H. Cullen of Burra North has won the contract for the weekly Eastern Mail.

Burra Burra Show Inc.  AGM

The President Mr Rex Stockman expressed pleasure at the results of last year’s show both with respect to exhibits and financially.  It was decided this year to ask the Premier Hon. Steele Hall to open the 1969 Show.  Cadell Training Centre will be approached to exhibit its produce.

The 1968 Show was opened by Mr E.C. Allen MP, Member for Burra.  The 2527 entries were just below the previous year’s record.  With 500 entries in the Horses-in-Action, the event ran throughout the day.  The Hack Section was among the best in the state.  Sheep entries were down, but quality was very good.  The wool display was good, but considering Burra’s position as the centre of a major wool district, it could be larger.  Industrial sites were filled and included a light aircraft display from Air Mist.  The agricultural pavilion had a good display of fruit, vegetable, needlework, grain and fodder, but lacked support in art and cooking sections.  The Rural Youth display was the same as was entered for the Royal Adelaide Show, and was of a very high standard.  Poultry and birds were well represented and although flowers and floral art entries were down by nearly half, the exhibits were up to the usual high standards.  Sideshows were very numerous and of greater variety than in previous years.  Thanks, of course, go to the convenors, stewards, judges and exhibitors and especially to our new secretary, Miss Judy Beinke.

Burra Rubbish Dump.  An anonymous invitation was extended to the Town Clerk and Councillors to attend a social gathering at the Council Dump.  The Council has long been aware of the untidiness of the dump, but it is due to ratepayers who insist on dropping their rubbish where they like, rather than in the designated place. The Council will cover the existing mess and appeals to people not to dump rubbish outside the official site.

Burra Town Hall interior has had a face-lift.  The interior has been painted, new lighting installed and shortly new carpet will be laid on the stairways to the lounge.  The ceiling over the lounge area has been replaced.  The new lighting should benefit balls in the coming season.

Council Elections

Mr T.G. Perry, District and Acting Town Clerk, advises that nominations for the annual elections for the two Councils should be called during April.  Owing to the amount of time necessary before the Combined Council can be proclaimed, the nominations will not be called until after 26 April 1969.  It is expected that nominations will be called for the now Combined Council, to close on the usual date; the second Friday in May – the 9th.  One member for each ward of the district and three members for Burra Town Ward will be required to give a Council of eleven members.  The position of Mayor is in doubt till the first meeting of the Combined Council.  To complete the official current term the two existing Councils will meet as a combined body for two meetings in May and June.  The new Council asked for a commencement following the first Saturday in July after the elections are completed.

Accident.  On Thursday afternoon a semi-trailer loaded with 117 bales of wool tipped over at Hanson, blocking half the road, which was busy with Easter traffic.  It was owned by Hi-Speed Transport of Broken Hill who sent two more vehicles and a forklift to reload the wool.  These arrived about 9 p.m.  Complications arose in trying to unload the forklift when the truck got bogged across the railway line when an attempt was made to unload the forklift onto the platform.  That delayed the northbound passenger train for 70 or 80 minutes.  Eventually the forklift had to be unloaded at the Burra Council Depot and driven to Hanson.

Another accident was luckily averted when a connecting bolt on a towbar broke and sent a caravan careering across the road at the scene above.  Fortunately no damage was done and repairs could be effected to allow it to continue.  Police eventually were able to leave the scene after 14 hours at Hanson.

Burra Corporation Ceases to Exist

From 25 April 1969 the Burra Corporation has amalgamated with the District Council.  The last meeting of the Burra Town Council was held on Monday 21 April and ended at 12.45 a.m. on Tuesday 22 April.  The Town Council had existed for almost 93 years, with its first meeting being on 10 July 1876.  It had been established by a proclamation of the Governor on 28 June 1876 and published in the SA Government Gazette of Thursday 29 June 1876.  This established a Council with Philip Lane as the first Mayor with six Councillors:

North Ward	George Sara & August Bartholomaeus

Middle Ward	Robert Saunders [Sanders] & Edward Lipsett

South Ward	Joseph Roberts & John Snell

The last Mayor Mr E.T. Baulderstone served on the Council for 23 years, the last 15 as Mayor.  He has seen the service of eight Town Clerks, several of whom had no previous local experience, which did not help to make Mr Baulderstone’s term an easy one.  The old Corporation comprised an area of 3,015 acres with some 53 miles of roads.  The existing Town Councillors will see out the final two months of the term they were elected for, as members of the amalgamated body, except for Councillors Moreland and Kotz, who, as employees of the District Council, are not permitted to serve as Councillors.  At the last meeting of the Local Board of Health for the Corporation Dr L.G. Miller was thanked for his services to the Board.

The District Council of Burra Burra was formed in 1935 as a result of the amalgamation of the District Councils of Hanson, Mt Bryan, Burra and [part of] Booborowie.  The new Council will encompass an area of 800 square miles with over 1,100 miles of road.  The new Council will meet for the first time on 14 May.  Councillors are:

Chairman G.R. Finch

E.T. Baulderstone	S.T. Miller

B.A. Riggs	J. Burge

R. White	M.T. Kellock

W.H. Quinn	H. Quinn

R.B. Jennison	C.L. Phillips

R.E. Angel	R.J. Jeffery

District Clerk is T.G. Perry.

Because the first meeting of the new Council will be on 14 May this year’s call for nominations for Councillors has been delayed.  They will be called at this meeting with nominations to close 30 May.

* 1887 was omitted and F.W. Holder was the Mayor for this year.

† In November 1888 P.L. Killicoat was elected unopposed for 1889, but on seeing the election results he immediately resigned, citing personal reasons.  In fact it seems he was unwilling to work with Cr Sampson.  As a result of nominations called for 24 December 1888 F.W. Holder was elected unopposed and served as Mayor for 1889

‡ This should read P.L. Killicoat

§ In November 1901 Alexander Harris was elected unopposed for 1902, but he died on 25 December 1901 without attending a meeting of Council.  E.W. Crewes was elected unopposed to replace him on 10 January 1902 and served as Mayor for 1902.

║ William Charles Leonard West was Mayor from December 1906-November 1908.  Dr John Ikin Sangster Jnr was Mayor from December 1908-November 1909.

¶A new Act of Parliament, effective 2 November 1934 changed the Municipal Year from approximately a calendar year (actually December to November) to one running from July to June.  The life of the 1934 Council was extended to the 1st Saturday in July 1935.  This means that the later Mayors, beginning their terms in July, should be:

Obituary.  Stella Floyd Hawker died suddenly on 15 April at the home of her brother Cuthbert Ford Featherstonhough at Hamilton, Victoria.  She was buried at Bungaree Church, Clare after a service at St Andrew’s, Mt Bryan.  She was born at Albany, WA on 19 February 1898, the eldest child of Mr & Mrs Percy Featherstonhough and she married George Stanley Hawker of Clare 21 October 1931 and resided in that district till February 1935 when Mr & Mrs Hawker made their home at ‘Belcunda’ Mt Bryan, where they resided till her death.  Mrs Hawker took an active part in community affairs at Mt Bryan and Burra.  She was a Director of East Bungaree Stud and kept the books and managed the stud for nine months while Mr Hawker was in camp.  During WW II she was leader and organiser of the Mt Bryan VSD.  She was made a Life Member of the Burra Women’s Branch of the LCL on 5 July 1963 for services to it, having retired as President of the branch in 1959 after years in that post.  She was a member of the Council from 1947-60.  Mrs Hawker was the foundation President of Mt Bryan CWA branch when it was formed after WW II.  She had also put in years of service for the Red Cross during the war.  She had earlier been active in the Burra CWA branch and many CWA garden parties were held at her home over the years.  Although she had no children of her own, she took an interest in the M & BHA.  She was a keen supporter of the Burra Show and exhibited in the Floral and Vegetable Sections.  She was responsible for many improvements to the two churches where she worshipped, most recently for the steps up the embankment from the street [at St Mary’s].  The Sanctuary Light and Litch [sic] gate [lych-gate] at Mt Bryan were the brain children of Mrs Hawker.  She believed strongly in improving the district one lived in.

Weather.  On 21 July an inch of rain with some hail and fairly heavy snow fell throughout the district.  The rain began about 5 p.m. Sunday and continued to about 3 a.m. when heavy hail fell.  Snow began to fall at about 7.10 a.m. becoming quite heavy by 7.30 a.m. and continuing until 8.15 a.m.  Burra and the surrounding hills were covered in snow. At Hallett it lay two to three inches deep for miles and also at Mt Bryan, where it remained on the Mount till late afternoon.  Snow was also reported at Clare, Mintaro, Whyte Yarcowie, Booborowie and Farrell Flat, where there was a further light fall at 2.30 p.m.

In the hills between Mt Bryan and Booborowie it lay six inches deep for some time. The main street of Burra was covered by three to four inches.  Mr George Fairchild reported heavy snow on the Booborowie mail run via Leighton.  Power failures were reported from Booborowie, Mt Bryan and Hallett.  Between Waterloo and Burra power interruptions have occurred in the past few days, but magpies were to blame, having been building nests with short lengths of fencing wire.  It was generally said to be the heaviest fall of snow for at least 40 years and possibly since 1901.  It will easily be remembered as occurring on the same day man first set foot upon the moon.  Burra’s 105 points of rain includes 21 points of snow.

Thefts.  In the past six months the theft of sheep from Burra properties has been prevalent.  The police are only now discovering that a large number of missing sheep have not been reported.

Burra Mine

The MP, Hon. G.J. Gilfillan made a statement and asked a question in Parliament, of the Minister of Mines.  He said that previously the lage low grade deposit of copper ore at Burra had been considered too expensive to treat to be a viable operation.  Now further experiments had taken place.  He asked: ‘Can the Minister say whether sufficient progress has been made to make the extraction of such ore a commercial proposition?’

The Hon. R.C. DeGaris confirmed the problem and said a process called the Glyserol Process had been shown by CSIRO to work in the laboratory.  The Government is examining the process at the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories to see if it is practical as a commercial operation and results are awaited.

The Burra District Swimming Club & Burra Football Club have been granted use of the Burra Town Hall on 30 August and 4 October and pictures will be cancelled on those nights.

Picture attendances have improved somewhat since the hall modifications have been completed.  There are at present no intentions to further disrupt the pictures.

The Burra Schools have poor water pressure making the additional fire hydrant installed last winter ineffective.  The E & WS Department will provide an alternative feed by laying a main across the creek from the Telephone Exchange.

A Boy Scout Troop may be established in Burra.  About 40 enthusiastic boys and six parents attended a meeting on Friday in the Town Hall.  The Clare Troop would provide guidance and leadership for the first six months.  The co-operation of a solid body of parents id needed and the willingness of persons to fill the vital positions of Club Leader, Scout Master and Group Scout Leader.

A new Burra Police Station will be built on the site of the existing station and police residence in Chapel Street.  Whether it will include court accommodation is not known.

Matthews Emporium has purchased the adjoining Gill’s Store.  It is expected that a new frontage for the whole building and extensive modifications will enable the store to hold greater drapery stocks and a complete range of furniture and furnishings.

Burra Swimming Pool will be aided by the Kapunda Musical Society’s production of The White Horse Inn at the Burra Town Hall on 4 October at 8 p.m.

Methodists from the Burra Circuit met in the Redruth Sunday School Hall on Sunday to consider the practical issues facing the local church.  The presence of two churches in Burra has been an issue since the 1957 Methodist Conference sanctioned the amalgamation of the Kooringa and Redruth Circuits.  It was now evident that enough people were convinced that a complete union in the circuit was needed and the discussion had to consider the closing down of one of the centres of worship.  64 people attended in the morning session and 50 in the afternoon.  The discussion resulted in four recommendations:

The church worship and Sunday school should be in one property and that should be the larger Burra [Kooringa] Church.

The other property would be the focus of all the fellowship groups – for all business meetings, educational meetings, adult and youth groups and the guild meetings.

The surplus church (whichever was ultimately decided upon) should be offered to the Lutheran Church, should they desire to take control of it.

The Burra Guilds should unite.

Rev. Milton Edwards was pleased with the growing sense of unity and of strengthening ties within the circuit.

A Burra Boy Scout Troop came a step closer when 13 parents visited Clare Troop on Friday as observers.  A parent committee was formed afterwards to advance the cause: Chairman, Rev. Milton Edwards; Secretary, Peter Mengersen; Treasurer, Rob Mason; Group Scout Master, Brian Ashdown.  Gordon Webster and Bill Barker have expressed willingness to be Scout Masters.  The Committee would like to hear from those willing to lead a Scout Troop or Cub Pack.  Women Cub Leaders are most acceptable.  Two possibilities for Scout Rooms are the old Methodist property at Hanson or the Burra Salvation Army Citadel.

Burra Gold Club Open Day was held on Sunday and drew 102 players.

Burra Burra DC has adopted a new assessment with a total assessment value of $7,325, 130. In most cases the rating will be lower in the Town Ward than previously.  There has been a proposal to improve the Town Hall by adding toilet facilities and building administration offices on the vacant land adjoining the hall.  It has been found that the new Council, having eleven elected members and at least two officers with the Clerk and Overseer, meetings can build up to 15 members, which is greater than the present offices can accommodate.  Office staff are cramped for room and storage is inadequate.  [The rate for the Town Ward was 10c from a notice on page 6.]

Obituary.  Mrs Jim Lomman was buried at Booborowie on Saturday.  She was living at Balaklava, but was formerly of Booborowie.  [Ethel Cecilia Elizabeth Lomman died 22 August 1969 Balaklava aged 74.  On death registration said to be widow of Francis James Lomman, but no marriage on SA CD.  The only woman with these given names seems to have been born Ethel Cecelia [sic] Elizabeth Slee 12 June 1895 Melrose, making her the right age, but she married Edward William John Summers in 1917.  He died in 1949, so Jim Lomman could be a second marriage.  The husband is equally elusive.  Births suggest a Francis Joseph or a Frederick James.  The latter was of Booborowie 1892-1962, but any marriage is after available CD dates.]

Burra Boy Scouts

The Group Committee now numbers 12 adults.  The committee has decided the old Methodist Church property at Hanson is an ideal location and the ten minute drive from Burra is not considered significant.  Negotiations with the trustees are under way.  The advantages are that the Cubs and Scouts can each have a separate building and can meet simultaneously.  Equipment can be left in situ from one meeting to the next.  The distance will test scout and parent loyalty to the cause and the necessary roster to get scouts to the site will cement parent involvement.  The first meeting of the First Burra Boy Scout Troop and the First Burra Cub Pack is scheduled for Friday 26 September.  Parents are urged to attend.  Registered Scout Leaders to date are Mr G. Webster, Mr W. Barker, Mr W. Salter and Cub Leader is Mrs I. Tamassy.  Costs are 50 cents on nomination and 10c per night. Uniforms will not be required for four or five months, which is time enough to predict the success or failure of the venture.

Burra Burra Hospital Inc. The Chairman R.K. Pearse presented the 92nd Annual Report.

The financial position was very sound.  [Details are given.]

No major improvements were made in 1969.  The total cost of the Alice Collins Wing was $98,892 and payment of $2,392 was yet to be made.

An intensive care unit has been installed and thanks go to generous donations from the late Mrs G.S. Hawker, Mr F. Reed and Mr J. Barker towards that unit.  This is the only intensive care unit in a Government Subsidised Hospital in SA.  A new ironing machine has been placed in the laundry, the parking area has been fenced and heating installed in the kitchen and domestic dining room.  There are plans in the hands of the Hospital Department to modernise the Maternity Wing and kitchen.   The cropping program this year delivered $1,307.  We continue to be indebted to Mrs S. Scroop and her energetic helpers in the Auxiliary.  Staffing remains difficult.

Adelaide Wool Sales 16-18 September saw prices largely unchanged.  [Local district prices are printed.]

The name Burra is still of doubtful origin, but much of the evidence suggests a Hindustani origin.  The name was first used in 1843 by Captain Charles Frome, Surveyor General of SA – two years before copper was discovered.  In his Northern Expedition sketch book he has a water colour entitled ‘Shepherd’s Hut on the Burra Creek’.  The hut is undoubtedly that of William Streair, who first found copper on the present Princess Royal property.  He worked for James Stein, who in 1843 held a lease along the Burra Creek and Indian coolies worked for him and gave the name Burra Burra to the creek – it being Hindustani for big-big or great-great.  Streair’s hut was near the present Princess Royal homestead.  The directors of Sammie first called their mine Wheal Grey after the Governor, but soon changed it to the Burra Burra Mine.  The directors always assumed it to be a Hindustani name without giving a reason.  Later it was suggested it was of native origin, but the early evidence points to the Hindustani origin.  The collection of towns around the mine gradually came to be called ‘The Burra’, though the name was not used officially until after the opening of the railway station in 1870 and did not come into local use until after the foundation of the Corporation in 1876.

Burra Mine

Mr E.C. Allen today announced plans for the mining of copper at Burra, as advised him by the Hon. Minister of Mines Mr R.C. De Garis.

A consortium of companies comprising Broken Hill South Ltd, North Broken Hill Ltd, E.Z. Industries Ltd & McPhar Geophysics Pty Ltd, advised they were relinquishing interest in the area after almost four years examining its prospects.  The Minister then accepted a proposal from another group, which was prepared to start mining copper at Burra within a few months.  Details of this new group are not yet finalised, but the technical staff will be headed by Mr B.H. Lewis, until recently Chief Geologist with Broken Hill South Ltd.  The company will be mainly Australian, but Mc Phar Geophysics Pty Ltd of Canada has expressed an interest.  The operation will centre upon the recovery of copper by ammoniacal leaching of oxidised ore in and near the old open cut where reserves of c. three million tons of 1.6% copper have been established.  Initially they would treat 200 tons per day and would have a labour force of about twenty men.  This would be scaled up to 500 to 700 tons per day over 18 months and stabilize at 180-200,000 tons per annum to give the known reserves a life of at least 20 years.  This would require a labour force of about 50, which the company would hope to recruit locally.  The Minister was delighted with this development.

The re-opening of the mine has long been sought and although this was a comparatively small operation, it would give the town a boost and continued exploration could reveal greater reserves.

Ore would be mined, taken to the crushing plant and then leached with ammonia in 500 ton vats.  The process would take about one week per vat.  Two vats would be used initially to handle 100 tons per day.  The product would be copper oxide.  The production of copper sulphate is also being investigated.  It is hoped to use natural gas as the heat source required – the nearest connection is 15 miles away.

The open pit operation would involve moving about 700 tons of ore and 1,000 tons of waste per day, or a total of between 1,500 and 2,000 tons of material daily.  It was hoped local operators could do this. The aim was for a long-life operation.

The company has been incorporated in the name of SAMIN Ltd.  It is a public company formed for the purpose of mining Burra copper ore and having also interests in other states in perhaps lead and tungsten production.  As income permits it is intended to continue exploration in the mine area as well as north and south of the deposit.  When work began it was expected extraction of ore for four or five days would be followed by seven days of processing using three shifts a day.

Burra Football Club held a wind-up dinner-dance for the season in the Burra Town Hall on Friday night.  Club trophies were presented:

Best & Fairest ‘A’ Grade went to Barry Eberhard

Best and Fairest in ‘B’ Grade went to Alan Day.

The ‘B’ Grade team received the ANZ Shield as premiers.

Burra on Canvas.  Twenty-two artists displayed their works on Burra at the Burra Hotel on Friday evening.  All except the spritely 75-year-old Miss A. McNamara were amateurs.  The group was welcomed on Thursday by Council Chairman Mr Roy Jeffery.  The works were executed in a variety of media.  The group has such an outing annually and has previously visited Pt McDonnell and the Flinders Ranges (twice).

Burra High School

When asked by Mr Allen whether she would consider a new school for Burra in the light of the expected boost to the town from the re-opening of the Mine, the Minister the Hon. Joyce Steele said yes.  The High School shares the old building with the Primary School, plus a number of temporary classrooms.

Mr W.A. White, President of the SA Institute of Teachers, spoke in the Burra High School Hall on 30 September on the crisis in SA education under the heading Deficiencies in Education.  Mr N. Brand, Senior Master at the High School, also spoke on the local problems with make-shift specialist rooms, lack of science facilities, overcrowding in temporary buildings, lack of planning in the yard and poor physical education facilities.  Mr Wood, Head Teacher at Booborowie, also spoke, saying he thought Primary Schools were the ‘Cinderella’ of the Education Department and small schools fared worse than larger ones.  Other problems were the stresses of multi-grade classes, the need to be teacher-drivers and accommodation difficulties.

Russell McDonald writes from NSW in appreciation of receiving the Record while serving in the Army.  He was at Burra for schooling and his parents now live at Redcliffe Station.

Burra Burra DC has appointed a Health & Building Inspector to report on all premises and where necessary to require repairs and renovations.  Many old houses and other buildings are cracked and have damp walls and lack proper bathrooms and toilets.  It is important for tourism that eyesores are eliminated.  These also lower the value of adjoining properties.

Burra Mine

A meeting at Burra Town Hall on Friday was arranged by the Burra Burra DC to consider the implications of the re-opening of the mine and the impact on historical buildings there.  The Directors of the new company were anxious to give information to the district as soon as possible.

Mr Claude Allen said that on 10 January 1966 the then Minister of Mines Mr S.C. Bevan accepted a proposal from Mines Exploration Ltd to commence test drilling. The present Minister gave them till 16 September 1969 to decide on continuing.  They declined and SAMIN will commence preliminary operations shortly.  With respect to Mr Ian Auhl’s concerns expressed in the Advertiser about the protection of historic buildings he said several years would pass before decisions had to be made, but every care would be taken to preserve whatever was possible.  It is the opinion of those concerned that tourism and mining operations can work together.

It is anticipated the company is likely to pay about $50,000 per annum to the Council in royalties.  Mr E.T. Baulderstone asked about what would happen to waste water.

Mr Lewis said it would be recirculated or run into the creek as pure soft water. With 70-80,000 gallons used each day, the creek could be dammed to hold water six to ten feet deep and it could also be used to beautify the banks with lawns and shrubs etc.  Jobs would be offered to locals, but outsiders could be brought in if needed.  It was thought only two or three female workers would be required.  (Probably in laboratory work.)

It was likely the mine would hasten a decision on building a new High School.

Burra Mine.  Mr Allen MP asked a question in Parliament concerning the possibility of a gas line from the main pipeline to Burra.  He also corrected a mistake in the newspaper report, which said production would increase to 500-700 tons per day over 18 months to stabilize at 200,000 tons a year and this would yield 200 tons of copper metal per annum.  Actually it will yield 2,000 tons of copper metal valued at $3 million.  Initially the company will use fuel oil so will the Minister take up the question of supplying natural gas to the mine?  The Hon. F.W.H. Coumbe undertook to bring the matter to the attention of the Natural Gas Pipeline Authority.

T.G. Perry writes.  [He is responding to an assertion apparently made on a Channel 9 Newsbeat program on 14 October that NOTHING was being done about developing Burra’s tourist potential.]

In 1959-60 the Corporation of Burra purchased the Burra Mine Paddock.  With the drive of the Mayor E.T. Baulderstone and the then Town Clerk Mr R. W. Fullgrabe and the co-operation of the District Council the area was provided with access roads and the mine workings were fenced for safety.  On Friday 17 November the area was opened as a tourist attraction by the Director of the SA Government Tourist Bureau Mr P.F. Pollnitz.  At the same time a souvenir brochure was produced giving historical details.  This was followed by investigation of the ore at the site by the Department of Mines and Mines Exploration Ltd.  In the time in question the Corporation developed a Caravan Park and a swimming pool.  Burra Creek has been improved by the Council and a picnic ground developed on the bank opposite the Caravan Park.  A brochure outlining the town’s items of interest is in its second printing.  Rev. G.D. Sibly developed a Historical Room at St Mary’s Church.  The National Trust has assisted with historical matters in the town and maintains a Museum in the town.  It has also helped to restore Redruth Gaol with a subsidy from the Tourist Bureau.  Colour slides and gift cards of historic buildings have been made available.  The National Trust and Mr Ian Auhl produced one of the National Heritage films presented on ABC TV, dealing with Burra and its historic buildings.  Work is presently being done to preserve Burra Miners’ Dugout Homes.  With much work from Mr S.J. Woollacott Paxton’s Cottages have begun to be restored.  The RAA has improved signage.  Improvements have been made to the golf course, bowling green etc.  To say nothing is being done is a wild statement born from a lack of investigation.  Requirements for the preservation of historic sites and buildings in the re-opening of the mine are being supported.

Burra Scouts have set a target of $500 to be raised.  So far 50 boys from 39 families are involved in the Cubs or Scouts.  Mr Ashdown, Group Master, said the first year would be the most expensive because basic equipment has to be acquired.  It is hoped each family might contribute $10 and so avoid the more exhausting forms of fund-raising – though no family is bound to pay that sum.  That would leave about $100 to be raised by other means.

Burra Hospital has been advised by the trustees in the estate of the late John Robert Barker that there is a bequest to the hospital of $70,000 for the purchase of land and the erection of cottage homes for the aged.  They are to be known as the Barker of Baldina Cottage Homes and are to be erected on land adjoining the hospital.  The suggested model to accommodate 16 persons is ten motel type single units comprising a bed-sitting room, small kitchen, bathroom and private verandah.  Two motel type single units slightly larger with the possibility of an additional bed or divan and two double units for couples with a bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom and private verandah.  Communal facilities will include recreation-living room, laundry, storage and boiler rooms etc.  Each unit would have a small flower garden and there would be seven vegetable plots.  There would be areas of lawn with shrubs and concrete paths.  Each unit would have reticulated hot water radiators and air conditioning.  The estimated cost of the project is $108,000.

$90,000 for land and construction costs, eligible for a two for one subsidy.

$14,000 for furnishings and equipment, eligible for a one for one subsidy.

$4,000 for lawn and paths, which would not receive a subsidy.

Of the total the subsidy would amount to approximately $60,000 and the cost to the Hospital would be approximately $50,000.  The late Mr Barker’s will also provides for a special donation of one nineteenth of the balance of his residuary estate after certain bequests, to be made available to the Hospital for building or an addition to such Hospital property.

The Burra Benevolent Society has also been advised it will benefit from the J.R. Barker estate.

Burra Town Hall Pictures

In recent months efforts have been made to improve the hall and a good deal of money has been spent.  At the pictures, unfortunately, good programs are being spoiled by children tracking in and out at any odd time and youths making a nuisance of themselves.  The police have been advised and in future those who disturb the theatre risk being removed.  Parents are asked to exercise control over their children.  The program regularly runs at a loss.

Booborowie Town Streets will all be sealed by the end of the week.  Some sealing has been done in Farrell Flat last season and a similar program is planned for Mt Bryan in the near future.

Accident/Obituary.  Julie Kathleen Cullen (3), the daughter of Mr & Mrs Henry Cullen, died on Thursday after being run over by a truck being prepared for one of its regular trips to eastern stations.  At about 10.25 a.m. it ran forward and passed over her as Mr Cullen was about to enter the cab.  She was taken to Burra Hospital with internal injuries and died within half an hour.

Carols by the Swimming Pool drew a large crowd on Sunday evening in perfect weather.  Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr Roy Jeffery delivered his Christmas message.

The Headmaster presented the school’s 57th Annual Report.

[He welcomed the guest speaker who was Senior Lecturer in Education at Salisbury Teachers College and also Mr E.C. Allen MP.]

The year opened with 180 students, an increase of 12 and there were eleven staff members, of whom seven were newly appointed to Burra.  I came from being Deputy Headmaster at Kadina.  Mr Moyle came from Murray Bridge, Mr West, Mr Salt, Miss Russell, Miss Pfitzner and Miss Strahan were appointed from college.  Mrs Brand was part-time librarian from the start of second term.  At the end of second term we lost the services of Miss Strahan due to illness and she was replaced by Mr Fisk, a recent arrival from Canada.

Paving of the school grounds remains in a shocking state, but we hope for improvement shortly.  Work was begun on a retaining wall around two of the tennis courts, but although begun in September, it is yet to be completed and in the meantime half of the court surface is broken and useless.  The grassed area is in good condition.

The Parents & Friends’ Association has been active and very helpful this year and many thanks go to the President Mrs Matthews.

[School visitors and speakers are then listed, followed by a report on internal sporting activities.]

Last year’s Leaving results were disappointing.  The average result of Grade IV or better was 63.4% compared with a state average of 75%.

The Intermediate Examination was held for the last time and Burra did very well with a Grade IV or better result reached by 85.9% of subjects compared with a state average of 75%.  Especially noteworthy were:

Lynnette Griffen	7 subjects and six at Grade 1 level

Neville Hyde	7 subjects and five at Grade 1 level

Angela Quinn	8 subjects and four at grade 1 level

David Francis	7 subjects and four at Grade 1 level.

In this year’s Leaving Class seven students held scholarships and recently it was announced that Ann Brak has won a Commonwealth Scholarship.

The failures would seem to be less a lack of ability than a lack of drive.

[The Headmaster then went on to discuss the division of students into different tracks corresponding to differing abilities and interests.  He also discussed promotion for the first three years of High School on the basis of continuing assessment.]

Staff changes at the end of the year:

Mr Brand has been promoted to Deputy Headmaster of Willunga High School.

Mrs Day has decided to resign.

Mr Johnson has been transferred to Taperoo High School.

Mrs Fisk (formerly Miss Wilkinson) has been moved to Nailsworth Girls Technical High School.

Mr Fisk also leaves.

[The Headmaster then thanked the Prefects, the Clergy, the Choral Group and the cleaners.]

Burra Pre-School Kindergarten had a successful year with the Director Miss Ashby and Assistant Miss Quinn.  There were 19 applicants to replace Miss Quinn, who will be married in the New Year and from them Mrs Dean Bernhardt has been selected.  An end of year Christmas Nativity was well attended and enjoyed by the children and visitors.

Railway Timetable Changes

With delayed opening of the new standard gauge railway line there is also news that the rail service to Broken Hill via Burra will depart Adelaide over one hour later.  Mr Allen MP said passengers at Peterborough had to rise at 3 a.m. to catch the morning train and could not return till 11.47 p.m.  Departure from Adelaide at 7.10 was long after shops had closed.  He felt that at least on nights other than the Broken Hill express the train could depart at 6.10 p.m.  The answer was that the fast goods train had to depart at 5.30 p.m. and it was essential it keep ahead of the passenger train all the way to Peterborough.  The changes also affected mail closing times.

Thefts.  A 1964 Holden owned by Trevor Menz of Burra North was stolen from in front of the Bon accord Hotel on 29 December.

A caravan type gas cylinder was stolen from a Highways Dept. camp nine miles east of Sturt Vale last week.

Accidents

A car driven by William J. Corner of Burra collided with a strainer post on the Mt Bryan Road on 1 January.  The driver suffered abrasions and concussion.

Christmas Eve in Burra was rather wintry, but trading was brisk.  Father Christmas distributed ice cream and the merry-go-round was popular.  Some other centres were less lucky, with rain forcing the cancellation of some events.

Burra National Trust held its AGM.  President W.L. Moore summarised the year’s work in the 6th annual report.  With the opening of the Mine proposed, the Trust has been working to preserve the Engine Houses.  Mr Lewis, General Manager of the enterprise, assures us he is as interested in the history of the area as we are and every effort will be made to preserve the buildings.

[Mr Moore said he would like to see a meeting between the Branch and Samin.]

Early in the year the National Trust acquired the land containing the two remaining dugouts and it will now be the task of the trust to restore them.  The proposed visit to Princess Royal Homestead has had to be postponed due to Mr Andrew Tennant’s ill health.  The visit in November would have coincided with the release of the book Historic Homesteads of Australia in which Princess Royal is featured.

In conjunction with the District Council the dugouts area has been cleaned up and the Trust now awaits prices for the restoration work.

Adult Education ran a School on Historic Copper Mines of SA early in May with Mr Ian Auhl giving a paper on Burra.  The climax of the school was a bus trip to Kapunda and Burra with lunch at Princess Royal.  The Burra Branch of the National Trust supplied afternoon tea for the visitors.

In August we were requested to roster people at the Museum in the absence of Mr Woollacott.  This will also be needed next year when Mr Woollacott and family are abroad.  This year the Museum had 1,530 visitors compared with 1,140 last year.

In November two members, Mr O’Connor and Mrs Radford attended on Adult Education School on Folk Museums and we look forward to making use of new ideas from them.

We are indebted to Mr & Mrs S.J. Woollacott for opening the Museum on Friday and Sunday afternoons.

In the year a plaque has been made in memory of Thomas Pickett and it is now ready for erection near the site of his shepherd’s hut on the bank of Diprose Creek.

The Museum also now has a tinted photographic copy of the Bentley painting recently presented to Head Office.  With the permission of the District Council many of the relics from the mining era were moved from the mine to the area adjacent to the Museum.

This year we printed another set of five cards making ten in all.  Thanks to Mr Maurice Perry for permission to draw on his splendid drawings.  A sketchbook of Burra is in the process of being printed at present and we thank Mr Auhl for transferring his royalties to the Branch.

We have had a visit from the Renmark Branch and an exhibition of paintings by a group of artists who previously spent a week in the town.

Merino Ram Embargo Relaxed

On 15 January the ban on the export of Merino Rams was relaxed.  Mr W. Brown of ‘The Grove’ Burra is President of the SA Merino Breeders Association.  He said it was a step towards the unity of the wool world.  The rest of the world had resented the embargo.  There can still be no export of semen or ewes and only 300 rams can be exported.  Mr Brown doubted whether that number would be reached.  There will be only one auction sale in each state in the twelve months before the policy is reviewed.  Mr Brown thought that 300 rams would not affect the Australian Stud or Commercial Breeder.  In 1967 he said from 1,850 registered Merino Studs 202,000 rams were sold.  In that year 1½ million Merino Ewes were mated.  Unsold rams that year totalled 294,000.  Given this scale of operation the 300 will have little impact.  He does, however, think the change might encourage breeders to produce more top sheep as has occurred with other breeds.  He also thinks it will foster the International Wool secretariat in obtaining support from all wool producing countries.

Burra School will soon have better water pressure.  A 4 inch main is being run across the bridge in front of the Town Hall.  The work has been delayed by fire bans hampering the use of hot lead at many connections along the way, but the project should be completed before school resumes.

Burra Memorial Oval

Following the installation of a 22,000 gallon concrete water tank, the pumping equipment was connected to the power on Wednesday.  It will take 24 hours to fill the tank and a line of 11 sprinklers can empty it in 5-6 hours; delivering the equivalent of an inch and a half to the irrigated area.  A complete watering once a fortnight will now be possible.

Accidents

On Saturday at 8.30 p.m. about a mile the Burra side of Klaebe’s Creek near Studholme a fully laden semi-trailer bound for Queensland overturned.  It landed upright with the trailer straddling the creek.  The driver Kenneth Payne of NSW was transferred from Burra hospital to the Adelaide Hospital suffering from a broken arm, lacerations and concussion.  The load of aluminium chairs, personal goods, data processing paper, children’s school shoes, drums of grease and cow hides was scattered about.  Four trucks were used to convey the salvaged goods to the Burra Police Station.  About 95% of the load was saved.  The Council grader and front end loader salvaged the damaged vehicle.  Damage to the vehicle was estimated at $3,500.

A car driven by Alan Day of Burra overturned on the Spalding-Burra Road yesterday near North Bungaree.  The driver and passengers Ashley White, Philip Byles and Andrew Phillips escaped with a shaking and bruises.  They were returning from a cricket match.

Accident.  A mini-sedan overturned on the road near Florieton on Saturday at about 10 a.m. and was discovered by Messrs Ron Thamm and John Taylor.  The 21-year-old driver was a school teacher of Berri who was travelling to Burra to visit her parents, who began working at Princess Royal yesterday.  She was shocked and bruised, but otherwise uninjured.

Redruth Methodist Church

About 150 people crowded into the church on Sunday morning for the service which marked the discontinuance of weekly worship there.  State Secretary of the SA Methodist Conference Rev. A.R. Medson preached the sermon.  Brian Thamm, who is Circuit Steward and Secretary to the Redruth Trust, read a statement outlining the reasons for the ending of services at Redruth and outlining the history of the church.  The decision ‘was made in the good faith that a unified congregation and a centralised witness of Methodism to the town and district, was the only attitude which could be rightly adopted by an authentic twentieth century church.’

The Past.  [Based on an article compiled in 1961 by Rev. Harry Alvey.]

The first mention of Redruth appeared in the minutes of the Kooringa Circuit in 1850.

Later in that year Redruth received from the Government 20 acres of glebe land and half an acre in the township.  The foundation stone of the first chapel was laid in February 1851.  Soon afterwards the gold rush began and the chapel was deserted except for a few women and children and in 1854 it was dismantled, to be reconstructed when the men returned in 1857.

In August 1873 the Trustees resolved to build a chapel on the present site.  It ultimately cosy £1,340 and was later extended to become the building it is today.  Kooringa Circuit was divided in 1889 with Redruth becoming a separate circuit with Rev. T.M. Rowe as its minister, living at Aberdeen.  When Methodist Union took place in 1900 the Primitive Methodist Chapels at Redruth, Ironmine and Copperhouse became part of the Redruth Circuit.  As the town’s population declined it could not support two Methodist ministers and the SA Conference approved the amalgamation of the Kooringa and Redruth Circuits in 1956.  For the past 14 years the two churches have been continuously used and maintained for weekly worship.  It is now acknowledged that the church in Burra must now become a united family.  The Trustees do not want to see the buildings stand neglected and unused.  The best solution would be for Christians of another Communion to take over and to this end a delegation will confer with the local Lutheran Pastor.

SA Stockowners’ Association, Burra Branch

Retiring President E.L. McWaters.  After three dry years last year produced good rains for stock feed in the pastoral part of the district, but little water in the dams.  Getting suitable employees has become very difficult and it is very hard to pay them adequately.  Wool prices are very unsatisfactory and the situation with wheat (for those combining wheat and wool production) is also unsatisfactory.  I believe a nation-wide organisation is needed.  Elected: President, D.V .Lord; Vice-Presidents, F.H. Treweeke & R.R. Cooke; Joint Secretaries, A.L. Wright & R.L. Wuttke.

New Home for Burra Burra DC?

The new enlarged Council was one year old on 24 April.  In that year the Council has become aware of the need for more space.  Records for the merged Council are temporarily stored in the existing DC Office.  Space is very limited and the space for office staff is overcrowded.  There is a need to house up to four members of office staff each day and allow for visits from the Health Inspector and Weeds Officer.

There is no space for the Overseer or for the plan storage he needs.  The present space is too small to reasonably accommodate Council meetings.  There is a lack of secure storage (in a fire-proof walk-in size strong room) for records.  These include assessments, accounting records, wage records, the leave register, road rental records, cemetery leases and burial records, dog registration, minutes of meetings for Council, committees and Board of health, machinery working records and quarry returns, among others.

Planning consideration has been given to the useful spaces at the Burra Town Hall – with its lack of toilet facilities and meeting rooms.  The Burra Library is in a remote location and could be moved to the present Council Chambers in Commercial Street where it could become a greater asset.  The Council decided after considerable discussion to approach a firm of architects to present plans of possible solutions for their problems.  The proposal includes:

A new block of administrative offices and Council Chamber on the block between the Town Hall and the [former] Post Office property.  [The eastern elevation is shown as a sketch on page 1, with a ground plan on page 4.]  This proposed new building would include:

A Council Chamber

An enquiry area and general office

A store room and strong room

A ledger room (for an accounting machine)

Offices for senior officers

Toilets

All records would move to the new office

The Reception Room in the Town Hall (formerly the Mayor’s Parlour) would be renovated.

Burra Library would be relocated to the existing Council Chamber in Commercial Street.

The existing Town Hall rooms would be remodelled to include a meeting room and toilets for both sexes.

A smoke lounge would be added on the south side.

The existing steep front steps would be replaced by two levels of wide steps.

Council staff at present comprises:

District Clerk

Two assistants

Health Inspector & Weeds Officer

Works Overseer

Ganger

15 Members of Council

[Items of Council plant for road works etc. are then listed.]

Ratepayers can be assured of continued improvements to services, especially with growing tourist interest.

The architects were Messrs Brown, Davies, Reynolds & Doley Pty Ltd.  The completed work is estimated to cost $75,000, of which the new office and administration block would account for c. $60,000.  Changes to the Town Hall would amount to c. $15,000.

It is hoped ratepayers will approve of this forward move.  Detailed enlarged plans are on view at the Council.  Questions may be addressed to Councillors or the Council Office.  The Town Hall would still have a rather Spartan stage, no theatre lighting, lack of backdrop changes and difficult changing from picture theatre to concert hall etc.

Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

Under the terms of the will of the late Mr J.R. Barker $70,000 was set aside for the purpose of erecting cottage homes for the aged on land adjoining the Burra Hospital.  Before the work could begin the Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes had to become an incorporated body, completely separate from the Hospital.  This has now been done.  Plans have been drawn up and as soon as finance comes to hand an immediate start can be made.

Weather.  Patchy rain fell in the past week.  World’s End and some eastern properties got much less.  Burra 100 points, Hallett 77, Mt Bryan 121, Booborowie 146, Mt Bryan East 70 and World’s End 48.

Aberdeen Basketball & Football Clubs have organised a Walkathon on Sunday.  The distance is six miles to Bruce Stockman’s.  Walkers are seeking sponsors for 50 cents per sponsor (not per mile).

Burra High School.  Water pressure at the school has been the subject of a complaint.  Mr E.C. Allen made enquiries and E & WS Inspectors report that at the school boundary pressure was 74 lbs per square inch and the flow 95 gallons per minute.  At one point within the school the flow was only 54 gallons per minute and the pressure 40 lbs per square inch.  It is the state of the internal plumbing that is causing the problem.  This can be rectified on order from the Public Buildings Department.

Burra Mine

It is expected the Mine will be in production by the end of 1970 and will employ 60-70 men when in full production in 1971.  This was announced in an election speech by Mr E.C. Allen MP in Burra Town Hall on Thursday night.  Samin Ltd has called tenders for the removal of waste material and of the ore itself.  The necessary plant to do that is estimated to cost $2 million.

Stage 1.  The company will treat 250 tons of ore per day.

Stage 2.  By October 1971 this figure will increase to 1,000 tons per day and will involve the removal of up to 7,000 tons of waste per day.

It is thought there are about 4.3 million tons of copper ore.

Samin Ltd is negotiating with the SA Housing Trust for houses to be erected in Burra.

Thieves

Mr Lloyd Parks saw two young males in his yard at about 11.40 p.m.  They fled on hearing his approach and Mr Parks found that a car belonging to his neighbour, Mr Brian Mitchell, had been pushed into the street and attempts had been made to start it.  Sgt Orford was notified and about 12.05 a.m. he heard attempts to start a vehicle in Ware St. where a car had been pushed from the home of Mr & Mrs Bill Byles.  The would-be thieves escaped.  On Saturday evening a ute owned by T. Ryan of Mt Bryan was left on the side of the road four miles south of Hallett when it had a flat tyre.  It was subsequently stolen and apparently driven with the flat tyre until abandoned a mile south of Yunta.

Ratepayer of Burra Ward writes:

I hope the Council will bear in mind when they start receiving significant royalties from the Burra Mine that in the past Burra has paid higher rates than most of Adelaide suburbs.  Despite some reductions last year, further cuts could be considered.  The improvements to the Town Hall are to cost ratepayers $125,420 (thirty payments of $4,180).  This is mainly for office requirements, so why not wait a few years and then build a complex to meet all purposes.  In the meantime rent or buy a house or hall.  Make the scheme wait till there is cash on hand and save more than $50,000 in interest.  A more immediate need is an Effluent Disposal Scheme, Reconstruction of the Main Highway and water tables through Burra, redevelopment of the shopping area and cement footpaths and curbs.

If the Council could advise ratepayers of its long term plans it would get support.  Silence breeds rumours.

B.H. Rogers of Paxton Tce writes questioning the wisdom of proceeding with the Town Hall alterations and Council Chamber at a cosy of $75,000 plus interest.  He considers the signs for the future of the economy are not promising.  If the Mine should boom again the proposed changes might prove to be inadequate.  All in all the ratepayers need to consider the proposal very carefully.

Housing Trust Homes for Burra

The District Council and Housing Trust met last week with the result that a number of houses are due to be built in Burra.  The District Clerk Mr Perry said the move follows requests from Samin Ltd and the Council.  The Company expects to employ up to 60 men and some of them will require homes in Burra.  The Housing trust has bought several parcels of land in the town, of which the most important is that which fronts Smelts Road and Paxton Terrace, formerly owned by Mr M. Pritchard.  This will be sub-divided for 32 homes.  It is expected construction will begin in July and the first allotment will possibly be for 12 houses.  Investigations are under way to see if an effluent scheme will be necessary.  Road works will also be required.  A plan of this subdivision is available at the Council office.  It is expected the open cut will soon be fenced to ensure safe operation.

Effluent Drainage Scheme

The expected plans from the Central Board of health had not arrived and a further request has been made.  When the plans arrive a meeting will be called so that those affected can ask questions.

Bowls.  Burra members are discussing the possibility of a new clubhouse.  Two proposals to either demolish and rebuild or to extend the present building were considered at a recent committee meeting.

At the AGM last Tuesday elected were: Patron, Dudley Jacka; President, Edgar Pietsch; Vice-Presidents, Darrell Field & Brian Riggs; Secretary, Wally Scott and Treasurer, Barry Biggs.

The plans of clubhouse changes presented by Dudley Jacka for consideration are available for inspection at the clubhouse and constructive criticism is being sought.

T.G. Perry District Clerk writes:

I have heard of vocal opposition to the Council proposals to improve accommodation for administration.  There is a real need to keep records safer and in a fireproof facility.  Opposing to the proposal is to oppose Councillors who have been elected to attend to the ratepayers’ affairs – not the clerk or office staff.  Councillors presently meet in very cramped quarters.  [He then lists the proposed changes.]

I suggest that those who consider the move to be progressive make their views known and also suggest that Councillors are ready to hear words of encouragement because they quite often hear words of criticism.  The details of the scheme are available at the Council Office.

Two petitions were received at yesterday’s meeting of Council objecting to the Council’s intention to raise $75,000 for the Town Hall Project and asking for a poll of ratepayers on the subject.  The notice of intention to borrow was published on 9 & 16 June.  The loan would be repaid over 15 years at 7.4% in half-yearly payments of $4,180.67.

The petitions come from ratepayers in the Mt Bryan and Farrell Flat Wards.  The poll has been set for Saturday 1 August.

Break-ins.  On Tuesday night last week three of the five Burra Hotels were broken into and cigarettes and cash were stolen.

Kooringa Hotel: 3,200 cigarettes, cigars, tobacco, matches, a transistor radio and $33.80 for a total value $152.80.

Burra Hotel: $30.

Royal Exchange Hotel: 6,660 cigarettes, tobacco and cigars.

Burra Bowling Club held its AGM.

President M.G. Stockman reported on the 1969-70 season.  The greens were in good shape thanks to greensman Chas. Dare.  The Club had two teams of twelve players in each of two divisions of Pennant Bowls.  The Easter Tournament had been a great success. Catering was done on site this year with an annex erected for the occasion by Dudley Jacka.  The present clubhouse is comfortable, but too small and there are moves to rebuild or enlarge it, subject to finance availability.  Brian Riggs was Club singles Champion for the season.

Jeffery spoke of the service of Mr & Mrs Baulderstone to the Town and District.  He was supported by Cr B.A. Riggs, Cr C.L .Phillips, Cr G.R. Finch & Cr R.B. Jennison.  Mr Baulderstone replied on behalf of his wife and also acknowledged the wonderful support she had given him throughout the period of his service.  He hoped the Mine might last the 15 years anticipated, but if it should not go longer, then he was sure tourism would play a big part in the future of Burra.  He hoped the mining operation would not destroy too many relics of the old Mine.

Centenary of the Railway to Burra

A double-headed steam train pulled by two Rx class locomotives (numbers 207 & 224) will bring 250 passengers to Burra to celebrate the centenary of the opening of the railway.  They are scheduled to arrive at 12.45 p.m., the same time the first train arrived at the opening of the line.  Rx locomotives were used on the line from 1906 to 1926.  They will use the old turntable before starting for Adelaide at 3 p.m.  100 years ago 3,000 people gathered for the arrival of the first train.  The select train bearing the Governor of Sa arrived at 1 p.m.  This year’s trip has been organised by the Australian Railway Historical Society in conjunction with the Burra Tourist Committee.  The passengers will invade the town in chartered buses to visit local points of interest.  Other visitors will come by car.  Dr John Wilson has written a publication commemorating the event with many photographs of locomotives and trains on the Northern Line.  It will be available on the day at c. $1.50.

Obituary.

Cr R.B. Jennison writes about the Council’s intention to borrow $75,000, in an attempt to counter some prevalent misconceptions.  He says:

It is quite untrue that rates would have to rise as a consequence.

It is not true that the 1970-71 rates are higher than those of last year: they are the same.

It is not true that a consequence will be less money spent on district roads – in fact it is expected to increase.

The amount is not too large.  In fact the Council at present is using less than one quarter of its borrowing capacity and this also answers the other false assertion that it is a very big project.  Council has borrowings of about half this every year for plant.

In fact the project is vital for the future and with royalties from Samin Ltd we could expect to pay off the loan in c. 5 years.

C. Leslie Phillips writes to urge participation in the poll of ratepayers on the intention of the Council to borrow $75,000 for building at the Town Hall.  He says he considers the Town Hall as belonging to the whole district in the same way that the Hospital, Schools, Swimming Pool, Showgrounds and churches etc. do.  All the fine buildings of the town were built at a time when many must have doubted whether the time was opportune for the expenditure: ‘surely our generation has not become so selfish that we want to accept all the benefits handed down to us and put nothing back.’

Burra Small Bore Rifle Club

The Department of the Army has inspected the Burra Small Bore Rifle Range and the position of the Housing Trust homes to be erected in Pritchard’s Paddock.  The Housing Trust has been able to give only 60 ft clearance from the butt and for safety reasons 80 yards is needed for the range to remain open.  The Army has declared the range closed for all shooting.  Negotiations are under way for a new site.

At the recent AGM Captain Mike Thomas made the report for the year.

Two new members moved away during the year: Bill White and Phillip Byles of the National Bank (transferred to the Adelaide branch).  This year Burra won the Williams Shield for the first time it has been competed for.  The club decided to accept the quote of J. Carpenter for cementing the top of the mound.  (The next step would be to erect a roof over the mound.) This work has been deferred pending a decision on whether firing can continue at the site as a result of housing being built on the south side.  The financial cost of moving would be substantial.  Special congratulations go to a new shooter Andrew Pearce, who has made rapid and sustained progress.

Accident/Obituary

A car and a water truck collided in dusty conditions on Friday about 12.30 p.m. just east of ‘The Gums’ Station on the Bower Road about half a mile from the Burra-Morgan Road.  The truck was owned by D. &. K. Launer and driven by Dennis Semmler.  The car was driven by Dudley Albert Launer.  There were three other passengers in the car and the four occupants were returning from Robertstown, having attended their uncle’s funeral there.  After the collision the driver of the truck went to ‘The Gums’ homestead and Dr G. Miller, Burra police and ambulance were summoned.  Three occupants of the car were killed instantly and John Lawrence Sachse (22) was found to be dead on arrival at Burra Hospital.  The other victims were:

Dudley Albert Launer (38) employed by the Robertstown Council and his brother

Kingsley Norman Launer (24) an earth moving contractor and their cousin

Clarence Norman Launer (40) a share farmer.

All sporting fixtures involving Robertstown Clubs were cancelled for Saturday and a triple funeral was held on Sunday in Robertstown.  Mr Sachse’s funeral was held on Monday in Adelaide.

‘A’ Grade	Auburn v. Robertstown [To be decided by delegates.]

Aberdeen 13.15 defeated SM United 2.7

Riverton 11.17 defeated Min-Man 0.1*

Riverton 11.14 defeated Min-Man 9.5*

Junior Colts	Aberdeen 4.5 defeated SM United 2.2

Riverton 7.10 defeated Min-Man 1.2

*These results do not make sense.  The absence of Colts results would suggest they are mixed with the above.  In the ‘A’ Grade the description says Riverton won by 31 points and this fits neither of the results, but perhaps the second of them is the ‘A’ Grade and the first the Colts.  In the ‘B’ Grade the match was described as evenly contested with Aberdeen winning, so perhaps the first is the ‘B’ Grade and the second the Colts, but that can only be speculation.

The Burra Railway

A report is printed from the SA Register of 6 January 1869 from a local reporter at Burra.

The railway works here are well advanced and could be completed ahead of contract.  Much curiosity is expressed regarding the site of the proposed terminus.  Four places are discussed:

Paxton Square, Kooringa.

The Courthouse allotments at Redruth.

An allotment near the Smelting Works on the Burra Survey, Redruth.

The Bon Accord Mine.

The arguments for and against each are:

Paxton Square is in the Township of Kooringa and a station here would increase property values, (the town is the property of the SA Mining Association) but against it is the cost of £20,000 to £40,000 to build bridges over the Burra and Welsh Creeks and in the cuttings and embankments, given that such expenditure would not increase the income by a single shilling.

The Courthouse and Smelting options at Redruth have similar cost objections.

The Bon Accord site is situated at the junction of the North and North-East Roads and is ¾ mile from Kooringa, with which it is connected by a good metal road.  There are no allotments on the site which would have to be purchased and it is the nearest possible site to the Burra Mine, with which it could be connected by an inexpensive tramway.  There is an abundance of splendid water and it is central to the freehold townships of Copperhouse, Hampton, Nelson and half a dozen others yet to be built on.  Its nearness to the Government Township of Redruth means business may be diverted from Kooringa, but the experience from other stations in SA suggests they do not become the best business sites.

Burra Mine

Roche Bros. Pty Ltd have won the tender for mining the waste and ore at the Burra Mine.  The treatment plant, which will comprise an ammonia leach operation producing copper oxide, will be designed and installed in two stages.

Stage 1 will be designed to use 300 tons of ore per day.

Stage 2 will allow this to increase up to 1,000 tons per day.

Tenders have been called for installation of Stage 1.

Removal of waste and preparation for ore extraction will begin in September with the Stage 1 plant expected to be commissioned early in 1971.  Stage 2 is in the design stage and should be commissioned by November 1971.

The plan is to site the administration office, workshops and amenities buildings on vacant land south of the Burra Railway Station.

The open cut and treatment areas will be securely fenced and tourist roads will either be maintained or re-routed where necessary.

Mr H.J. Rich has been appointed manager of the operation.

It is estimated 60-70 people will be employed fairly evenly split between the mining and the treatment-administration sites.

Burra Burra DC has asked the Central Board of Health to call tenders for the proposed Burra effluent drainage scheme.  When costs are known a public meeting will be called to discuss the matter with those to be connected.

The Council will provide several thousand yards of ‘crusher run’ material from its quarry at the Mine for road sealing.  Roche Bros. huge D8machine is working up the metal for crushing.  Sealing will be carried out for Samin Ltd around its administration building.

The Savings Bank of SA has given awards for savings to Burra Primary School ($100), Booborowie Primary School ($60) and Burra High School ($50).  The awards come in the form of library books.

Burra Mine

The Mine area has been closed to the public for safety reasons.  Large earth-moving machinery is moving through the area.  Recently a near fatal accident occurred when a big fully-laden water tanker was climbing out and encountered tourists heading down in a car.  The car driver did not reverse out and it was only with difficulty that the truck driver was able to engage reverse gear and control its descent to the bottom.  It could have careered out of control to the depths below.  Once the eastern side is fenced the District Council will complete new scenic roads to enable operations to be observed.  A new access road ahs been opened to the rubbish tip from opposite the hospital and the Burra North access has been closed.

Mining equipment is arriving at the Burra Railway Station.  New site offices will arrive tomorrow.  Building of offices, amenities block, control rooms and magazines will be carried out by Jaxon Constructions Ltd.  McMahon Constructions Pty Ltd will be responsible for earthworks and concrete construction – both are subcontractors for T.C. O’Connor & Sons.  Roche Bros are building the main haulage road for the quarry or mine to the primary crushing area and the main Fines Dam.  They have been moving 4-5,000 yards a day and it will be necessary to move another 140-150,000 yards to provide a cutting down to the mine.

Burra Rail Centenary.  Extract from the SA Register, 30 August 1870.

Monday 29 August was set for the opening of the North Extension Line.  The date was chosen chiefly because the MPs legislative duties prevented them from visiting Burra on the four successive days.

A local committee of 30-40 residents arranged the public demonstration, chaired by Mr W.H. Rosman, manager of the National Bank.  The select train started soon after 8 a.m. with a Vice-Regal and Ministerial Party.  [The official party is then listed.]

There was an official welcome at Saddleworth and then at 12.45 the special came within inspection distance of the Aberdeen terminus where it was met by ‘a host of strong, healthy looking men, hearty matrons, rosy cheeked damsels and a reserve of children such as only a mining community can boast of.’

All available space was adorned with pine and wattle boughs and the buildings set off with a display of evergreens ;which might have been Birnham Wood come back again to Dunsinane, as in the days of Macbeth.’

The goods shed had been clothed in evergreens till it looked like a bower 100 ft x 40 ft and the Carriage shed was similar on a smaller scale.  The select carriages arrived at 1 p.m. and His Excellency and party were conducted to a special reserve adjoining the cattle platform.  A round of loyal cheers followed from the crowd of c. 3,000

‘The local ordnance had fired an irregular salute.’

[Mr W.H. Rosman’s address to the Governor is printed as is His Excellency’s reply.]

Burra Mine

Scenic Roads are expected to be open for tourists by mid-October.

It is impossible to open the area at present due to the amount of large machinery working in the area, to constructional changes made to roads and to landslides.  Blasting in the near future is also a concern.  Fencing of the dangerous area will begin this week, after which work will be undertaken to admit tourists, possibly by mid-October, with views from near the water tank on the hill and from the southern hill.

The Kapunda Musical Society will present Lilac Time at Burra on 17 October at 8 p.m. [in the Town Hall] to aid the Burra Swimming Pool.

Vandals and careless tourists are causing concern to the Lewis Trust.  The site is a gazetted Historic Relic and under an Act of Parliament damage can earn a fine of $200 or six months in gaol.

Burra Mine

The newly formed local company Howe Enterprises has won a large sub-contract to fence the Burra Copper Mine.  This involves about two miles of six-foot-high chain mesh fencing.  Howe Enterprises is a consortium of Messrs O’Connor & Co., Hirschausen Bros. and Wardle & Sons.  Mr Hope, Site Manager of the Burra Mine, says work is well under way.  About 40 men are currently working on the site.

Burra High School

Mr E.C. Allen MP asked the Minister of Education to report on the inspection of the site recently and to say when the new Burra High School would be commenced.  [He provided background information of the present situation with its 100-year-old building, shared site with the Primary School, temporary classrooms and crowding at the present site.

The Minister said the inspection confirmed the need for a new High School.  It was presently programmed to have the new school ready for the start of 1974 and an endeavour would be made to advance this date, but that would depend on Commonwealth funding.  The existing building would then be upgraded to meet the needs of the Primary School.

Burra Mine.

Blasting operations will commence in the next fortnight.  It is vital that no one except authorised persons enter the quarry through any other entrance than Linkson Street.  The area is being fully fenced.  No one is admitted to the site without a pass from the office of O’Connor & Son in Linkson Street.

The Bon Accord pipeline, a six inch main from the old mine shaft to the Processing Plant is three quarters completed.  All sewerage services for the administration and plant area have been laid.  Storm water service for the area is nearing completion.  Work has started of the primary crusher footings and the leach tank footings.  The 1.5 million gallon reclaim dam has been started.  It will reclaim all used water on the site for re-use.  The ‘Fines’ dam of 110,000 cubic yards has been completed.  The fines will be processed later in stage 2 of the project.  ETSA supply to the site should be completed by the end of this week.  Fencing is ahead of schedule and should allow tourist facilities to be provided near the E & WS water tank for the show weekend.  At present about 80 men are employed and this should rise to about 250 by mid-November.

The new scenic road will be open by next weekend 24 October.  It will not be a 60 m.p.h. road, but a plain access road to be updated as time moves on.  Access is at the bend on the road between Burra and Burra North, known as Carpenter’s Corner.  From there it crosses the creek, turning south, skirts the old mullock dump and joins the old scenic lookout road at the top end of the dump.  You can then follow the road to the lookout point over Burra and carry on around past echo point to the old powder magazine.  From there you can look down on the new processing plant under construction and also into the open cut.  The site engineer, Mr R.E. Hope, emphasises that tourists are not allowed within the fenced mine area.

Messrs Ian Tiver & Roger Nutt welcomed persons interested in inspecting the shearing of their fine wool ‘Merryville’ sheep for the first time on Friday 17 October.  The sheep have been in the district for twelve months.  Mr Tiver and Mr Nutt bought 300 ewes of pure ‘Merryville’ blood twelve months ago to introduce fine wool Merino sheep to their Hallett properties.  The wool was a remarkably attractive clean staple with very little variation in the staple of 70’s quality wool.  The ewes averaged 10 lbs of wool from Mr Nutt and Ian Tiver expected about a pound less from his, due to a harder time through winter.  The beautiful handling wool is brighter and softer than their own type of wool and everyone was interested to see that such wool could be grown in country with an average rainfall of c. 16.5 inches.  [Further details are given in an article of c. 1¼ columns.]

Unfortunately the scenic drive was not open at the weekend because the fence was not quite finished.  It is hoped it will be ready this weekend.  Tourists must observe the signage at the Mine and severe penalties face anyone who enters forbidden areas.  Work is proceeding on the large leach tanks.  The first of the tank bases and tops arrived last week by road.  They are over 22 ft in diameter.  The remainder are due within weeks.  The 150,000 gallon storage tank for the Bon Accord water supply should be completed, tested and filled in the next 18 days.  Other site services are well advanced.  Tests on blasting noise and vibrations showed ‘the effect very negligent [sic] and will not effect [sic] people in the district.’  A siren will warn of blasting, which will normally be once a day.

Accident.  Peter Brown of Burra escaped serious injury when his car overturned on the Burra-Hallett Road on Sunday morning.

Milton H. Edwards writes to explain the necessity of suspending the Church Youth Programme, but his letter fails to make the cause clear at this distance in time, though presumably it was well understood when he wrote.

He speaks of the difficulties which have existed from the first instance that the group was formed and which it has not been possible to resolve.

‘This action is symptomatic of a deep-seated social problem which exists at the very heart of the Burra Community.  Different expressions of the same problem are occurring at every level of social activity.  It is not only the youth who are irresponsible.’

[Rev. Edwards refers to the circular he sent to parents in September, apparently spelling out the problem.  He does not now make it more explicit than in the sentence quoted above.]

Chapel Street Bridge.  When a loaded petroleum transport and trailer drove across the bridge on Wednesday some of the jarrah cross members gave way allowing some of the roadway to collapse.  The gross weight of the vehicle was about 36 tons.  The collapse occurred when the trailer was on the bridge and eighteen of the thirty-two drums of distillate slid into the creek.  They were reloaded per chain attached to a Council tractor.

Burra Caravan Park

Burra Burra DC has applied for a subsidy on an extra Caravan Park to be located opposite the existing park on the other side of the creek.  With the increasing number of tourists an extension of existing facilities is necessary.  The proposed new facility would cost about $8,000, of which half should be granted as a subsidy.  This would allow powered sites for twenty vans with toilets, showers etc.  This is an increase of 50% on the present facility.  Camp sites for twenty tents with the possibility of at least ten more power points on the northern end if necessary.  In the twelve months to 30 June the number of ‘caravan days’ has doubled on the previous year to bring in the fees of $1,365.

The Bon Accord Bridge has been demolished in the last few days.  It is understood to have been erected in 1898.*  E.R. Way & Sons of Thebarton won the contract to demolish and remove the structure.  The bridge will not be replaced, but a concrete causeway is likely to keep the road open.

[* The bridge was erected in 1892: see XV, 221, 7 Dec. 1892, page 3.]

Bon Accord Museum

The Director of the SA Museum Dr W.

He thought the buildings could become one of the biggest drawcards in the future of tourism in Burra.  He inspected the site with Mr L. Moore President of the Burra Branch and Mr R.K .Pearse President of the Merino Stud Breeders Association.  He said the exhibition relating to the Merino Studs of the district could well be of more importance than the mining relics; located at the centre of the SA Merino Stud area, it could assume national importance.

Burra Methodist Youth Fellowship

The temporary suspension of the program gave the committee time and opportunity to look at the aims and purposes of the group.  The MYF will sponsor a Dance and Social Evening at the Redruth Hall on 18 December.  Proceeds will aid the Annual Christmas Bowl Appeal. For 1971 members will be issued with a card clearly stating the aims and objectives of MYF.  To be valid it will have to bear the signatures of the member, the member’s parent or guardian and the minister.  [The Pledge of Membership and objects of MYF are printed and are suggestive of some of the problems recently experienced.]  In brief they included:

A promise to attend their church of choice as often as possible

To co-operate with appointed leaders

To respect the property and furnishings of the Methodist Church and to acknowledge that failure in this area could lead to closure of the group

To acknowledge that persistently unco-operative members shall, after due warning, be expelled.

Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd says the Burra silo is at present empty and ready for the new season’s intake.  It should be able to take all quota wheat.  Barley will be received on a through-put basis or at any time in bags.  The company seems likely to be able to take over quota wheat this season, BUT

Only when space is available in silos.

No farmer is to deliver more over quota wheat than 100% of the actual quota.

Total SA receivals of over-quota wheat do not exceed 50% of the state base quota.

These arrangements are not to be taken as a precedent for the 1971-72 season.

The Headmaster presented the 58th Annual Report

[He welcomed Judge Olsson, Federal MP C.R. Kelly and State MP E.C. Allen.]

The school re-opened in 1970 with 175 students, the same number as at the end of 1969.  There were eleven staff members of whom five were newly appointed to Burra.  Mr Ayliffe returned as Senior Master after a period at Norwood High School and a year’s study leave.  Miss Kussadias came as Senior Mistress from Henley High School.  Mr Allen transferred from Pt Augusta.  Miss Urlwin and Mr Williams were newly appointed from Teachers College.  At Easter Mr Williams was transferred to Coomandook where the school needed a bus driver and Miss Lupascu was sent her.  Mrs Day continued part time; teaching one subject and acting as librarian.  The time when we need a full-time librarian is fast approaching.  This year we have been greatly assisted by the appointment of a part-time clerk for ten hours a week, where Mrs Ashdown has been of great help.  (At least half-time would appear essential.)

Last year I was disappointed with the poor condition of the paved area and the loss of two tennis courts.  This year unfortunately there has been no improvement in that.  But I have been notified that tenders to remedy both deficiencies will be called in the first quarter of 1971.  The Memorial Garden continues to thrive and the flat, with some areas re-seeded, continues to make progress.  The fence to keep motor traffic off is appreciated.

The statement in Parliament that it is intended to have a new High School by 1974 means we may not be responsible for the care of these areas for much longer.

[The headmaster then goes on to praise and thank in the usual way the High School Council and the Parents & Friends’ Association.]

The Commonwealth grants are supplying some needed equipment, but other items need to be purchased; for example we have been supplied with a video-tape recorder, but tapes are needed for it and they cost over $27 each.

School assemblies this year included interesting talks by Miss Boona Ruhs, an Indian lady who has recently taught in Vietnam, Sally Valiente (a Rotary Exchange Student at Clare) and Mr Hope (Site Manager at the Burra Mine).

Through the sponsorship of the Methodist Church we have had a Rotary Exchange Student, Tom Eastman [from the USA].

There was a school trip in September to Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra – accompanied by Mr West, Miss Pfitzner and Mr & Mrs Salt.  The Junior School had a camp at Woolshed Flat.

[There is then a section on internal sporting and House activities.]

In examinations the results were not disappointing.  Overall subject ‘passes’ i.e. Grade IV or better was 85.6% compared with a state average of 75%.  Outstanding results were achieved by Lynette Griffen and Angela Quinn.  John Lloyd has been awarded a Commonwealth Scholarship.

This year we have completely dispensed with school examinations and promotion has been on the results of continuing assessment.  Leaving has an increasing focus on research and the library and out extremely small library is another reason why we need a new school.  This new approach to learning is an evolving process for both staff and students.  French was introduced in 1st Year for the first time to be extended to 2nd Year in 1971 and Leaving Typewriting will be introduced in 1971.

Some staff changes are expected.

Mr Moyle will be promoted to Senior Master and moves to Strathmont Boys Technical High School.

Miss Kussadias and Miss Urlwin are expected to move on.

[The next section dealt with the roles of House Captains and Prefects and was followed by general thanks to cleaners, the Burra Record, Mrs Carpenter for training the choir, the Primary School for co-operation, donors of prizes and Judge Olsson.]

Burra Burra DC, 17 December

Burra National Trust will accept an offer of spending $200 on materials with Council to supply labour for works at the Redruth Gaol.

Roads as set out in advertisements [presumably the notice 92, 47, 1 Dec. 1970, page 3.] will be offered at $50 plus legal, survey and transfer fees.

The National Trust wrote concerning the Mine buildings.  Samin Ltd is to be asked if its policy in this regard has changed.

The National Trust to make the miners’ dugouts chimneys safe.

Characteristics of the 1970 paper.

Generally there seems to be a good coverage of local news, although some snippets in ‘Out and About’ hint at stories that did not appear.  For example there is a reference in December to a near drowning at the Burra Swimming Pool, which is not elsewhere reported.  St Joseph’s Convent closed with only very brief incidental references.  The Bon Accord Bridge was demolished with only the briefest of notes.  These do leave you wondering what else might have been missed.  The Burra Mine seems to be quite well documented.

Page 1 was reserved almost entirely for news.  Beyond that pages carry perhaps two columns of news out of the seven.  There is, however, little consistency about where regular features are located.

Articles are often printed in the pages 4-5 gutter and sometimes in the 3-6 gutter.

There are quite a lot of general interest stories and articles, including items direct from Parliament or from the Member of Parliament.  These are almost exclusively from the Conservative side of politics.  Other items seem to have been press releases from the Australian Canned Fruits Industry, the Federal Government, the State Government, the Wheat Board etc.

Photographs continue to be few in number, but occasionally they appear in the same week as the event occurred.

Burra Mine

Work has resumed after the Christmas shut-down.  The aim is to start production on 31 January.  The general administration block and amenities section has been completed.  The plant workshop, stores and the large mine workshop are nearing completion.  The Boiler house and process plant are well advanced.  The primary and secondary crushers have been installed.  The ammonium storage facility will be filled this week.  Production is well underway in the quarry area.  Samin Ltd staff have arrived in the town and taken up residence.

Accident/Obituary.  A 50-year-old Victorian man died at Burra Hospital after his car overturned near Florieton on New Year’s Eve.  He was Donald Alfred Reynolds of Windsor, Melbourne.  A passenger, Eugene Ronald McCabe of North Sunshine escaped unhurt.

Fire.  On Saturday 26 December a station sedan driven by John Joseph Hoare of Plympton was destroyed by fire near Hanson Tanks while travelling from Adelaide to Broken Hill.

Burra Burra DC has received an $18,500 grant for work on the Burr-Booborowie Road.

Obituary.  Rev. Milton Edwards conducted the funeral service for William Ernest Dunhill at Redruth Church on 23 December 1970.  [Officially Ernest William Dunhill.]  He was born at Kersbrook 18 October 1874 and died at Redruth 21 December 1970 aged 96.  He had long been a faithful servant of the church.  His ministry as a local preacher covered a continuous period of 77 years.  He lived as he preached, in utter sincerity.  [Rev. Edwards reported hearing Mr Dunhill preach only once on 8 September 1968 and he preached only twice after that before failing health forced him to give up the work.]

He was essentially a nineteenth century man with an uneasy tolerance of the technological changes around him.  He was forty when WWI broke out and he came to Burra a year later.  In his teens he had gone to Orroroo to work on his uncle’s farm and in his mid 20s went to WA working in a timber mill in the jarrah forests.  He was at a blacksmith’s shop at Iron Knob when the iron ore industry began, before the town was built.  He then worked for some years at the mines in Broken Hill and was a handy blacksmith by the time he reached Burra in 1915.  He married in the first decade of the twentieth century [1908] and his wife died in 1950.  He outlived each member of a long-lived family.  Almost every Sunday for 50 years he rang the bell of the Redruth Church and for many years sang in the choir.  His work as a Sunday school Superintendent and teacher helped to mould the lives of successive generations of children now grown to adulthood.  He has a self effacing modesty and the strength of an independent spirit that refused to accept defeat.  The President of the Methodist Conference A.D. Blunt sent a telegram to ‘acknowledge the long life of service rendered by William Dunhill.’

[Note from earlier 85, 39 (4), 8 Oct. 1963, page 1

Mr E.W. Dunhill (89) has completed 72 years of service as a lay preacher – a record unequalled in the Methodist Church in Australia.  Mr Dunhill was born at Kersbrook in SA and in his early life went to WA.  He married there in 1908 and returned to SA in 1909, taking up residence in Burra in 1915.  He carried on business as a blacksmith for 65 years until he was 83.  He took his first church service at the age of 16 years 11 months.  He was the first person in Australia to hold a certificate recognising 60 years service as a lay preacher.  He was also active in Sunday school work for many years and was Sunday School Superintendent for 37 years.]

Preservation of Historic Relics

When it comes to keeping local heritage we can think about it, talk about it and argue about it, but are we prepared to pay for it?  In the past year there has been much heard about the historic mine buildings and their preservation.  The District Council and Samin Ltd have investigated the question.  Samin Ltd has identified the buildings which will remain and which will be demolished in the progress of their activities in the next two or three years.  Samin reports that operations starting early in 1971 will open cut the section of the ore bodies which were mined by underground methods in the last century.  The ore will be leached by an ammonium process for the recovery of copper oxide.  This is expected to extend the present open cut to approximately 2,000 feet in length by 900 ft in width.  The dimensions are based on the need to create wall slopes flat enough to ensure the safety of the open cut when it is mined to a depth of 300 ft.

The structures to be affected will be those on the western side of the open cut, namely the two old winding houses and old offices.  Three small roofless buildings closest to the southern end of the open cut will also be affected.  The old magazine to the west and the buildings at Morphett’s Shaft will not be affected.

Mining is expected to start at the northern end, which means the buildings affected will be preserved for at least two years, but will be removed within the next three years.  So the buildings in danger of demolition in the next three years include Grave’s Shaft and Pit Head and the round chimney at Peacock’s Shaft.  It has been suggested these two examples of old Cornish building could be relocated for tourist interest.  It is thought the cost of each would be $7,000.  Time would be limited to 1971 for the operation and funds could be sought state-wide.  Site Engineer Mr E.L. Hope has suggested, and arrangements have already been made to restore the old Powder Magazine.  And the Morphett Shaft Poppet Head could be restored with the necessary working pieces to effect the past appearance and purpose of the building.  This would be the cheaper operation and most interesting from a tourist point of view.

District Clerk Mr Perry felt the Council would not be prepared to spend rate money on such a project and neither would it  have other than a low priority for any royalties from the Mine.

This leaves public donation as the source.

Samin are prepared to alter their program of works to allow the removal of the buildings.

Mrs Ruby Rowe has donated the trolly and other items used by her late husband* in droving, to John Hanrahan of Naracoorte aged 81, so that he can return to droving.

Mrs Rowe’s gift included harness, three tents, tarpaulins, leggings, leather gloves, hurricane lamps, ropes etc.  The trolly left Burra by rail on Thursday.

Reprint from the Advertiser 5 January 1891 of an article by ‘Melas’.

A few remains of old huts will enable a visitor to Burra to form some idea of what and where they were when occupied, but they are crumbling away and in a few years hardly a vestige will remain.  Only a few of their occupants now survive and materials for this sketch came from their lips and pens.  The first two huts it seems were formed by the late Messrs John and Robert Collins, not far from the site of the Kooringa Hotel.  Soon huts lined the sides of the creek for nearly two miles and over 2,000 people lived in them.  The clay banks were almost ten feet high and easily excavated.  The roof was pierced and stones or a small flour barrel formed a chimney.  From the footpath one could see the fire places, the tea kettle and frying pan in use.  When an opening was left without a chimney persons sometimes fell in and many amusing stories are told of the tricks played by boys dropping things down.  The number of rooms varies from two or three to five and six and at least one resident wrote to a friend in England saying he had ‘an eight roomed house with a river frontage’.  A row of large gum trees lines the creek.  The sight at night with lights shining through the windows was imposing.  The huts were cool in summer, dry in winter and cosy.  Lime was freely applied and some rooms were papered and carpeted and the crude furniture of early days gradually became very comfortable and even luxurious.

Our informant spoke of the great weakness of the women of the creek to bake rich fruit tarts on Sunday afternoons and to their being annoyed if the visitor did not eat and drink a cup of tea with them, even if he had done so with others six times before.

Flood made havoc of the huts when the calling of geese, squealing of pigs, quacking of ducks and the roaring of water mixed with the screaming of women and children and the struggle of men to rescue their effects.

A witness described the flood of 12 May 1851.

People were getting their clothes ready for the tea meeting when a few large drops of rain fell near Longmead’s Store.  Soon people ran towards the creek from all directions.  The witness saw one man hand his children up to his wife on the bank as the water rushed past.  Sofas, boxes, beds etc. were being rescued or were floating towards the cemetery.  In the main street the water was ‘up to my body’ and a new bullock dray was swimming down with the wheels going round like the paddles of a steamer.  There were some narrow escapes and much loss and ruin.  The flood of 1859 did so much damage that few persons lived in the huts after that.  In 1877 the flood rose above the banks and carried away the old Kooringa Bridge for over a mile.  Cooper and Bailey were unable to display their menagerie.

Mr James Blatchford reached Burra in 18847 after a week’s journey from Adelaide by bullock dray.  He dug a hole near the smelting works and never lived more comfortably in his life.  He sold it for $28 and it was destroyed in the next winter.

The late Mr Daniel Llewellyn came to SA in the Prince Regent in June 1849 and proceeded to Burra where he bought a creek hut for $7.  It comprised a kitchen 10 ft long and 8 ft wide and a bedroom 8 ft square.  Both were 7 ft high.  A third room was formed 15 ft x 10 ft.  The walls were smoothed with an adze and whitewashed.  Five feet was curtained off for a bed and in the rest Welsh services and a Sunday school were carried on for a year, with a good attendance.  This hut was destroyed by the flood of 1851 and everything within it buried. A large costly Welsh Bible was dug out along with other books.  Mr Llewellyn agreed to buy another hut for $10 and paid $10 deposit. [sic?]  Within a month the second flood came.  He hurried from church to save his effects, caught a chill and died.

[Died 26 June 1851 aged 34.]

Ian Auhl letter concerning the resiting of Burra Mine buildings.

Now that Grave’s Pump House and Peacock’s Chimney Stack and Pump House are not in immediate danger of demolition, attention can be given to dismantling, resiting and re-erecting the buildings.  There appears to be a two year reprieve dating from September 1970, which gives a breathing space of eighteen months.

I am sure that with a little good will this is possible.  Problems are architectural and financial.

I submit the following steps as a plan of action:

Request the Minister of Conservation (Mr Broomhill) to call a meeting of interested parties.  (A request made perhaps jointly by the Burra Burra DC and the National Trust.)

Survey, planning and numbering of the masonry.  (A major and expensive task for the two pump houses.)

I have been contacted by a professional and reputable architect who will undertake the initial survey voluntarily.

Samin is interested in the speedy removal of the buildings and have expressed a willingness to assist in demolition and storage of the stone work.

My suggestions for resiting:

Peacock’s Chimney and Pump House to be re-erected on the mine hill where they would be visible from the by-pass

Grave’s Pump House to be re-erected at the old Mine entrance close to the Burra-Burra North Road.

An architect and contractor I consulted both see these position as suitable.

6.	Little finance would be needed to this stage.

7.	These are state heritage items so finance should not be just a local issue.

8.	A building contractor has suggested re-erection costs should be considerably less than $10,000 per building, given free architectural services and help from Samin in demolition.

9.	This money does not have to be found immediately.

10.	Sources of Funding:

The Government has accepted some of the moral responsibility for the future of the buildings and could contribute something each financial year.

The National Trust, both Burra and Adelaide.

Public subscription – making this via the National Trust would make donations tax deductible.

Burra Burra DC – I cannot believe, despite the article in last week’s Record that they would contribute nothing.

Tourist grant.

Re-erection as funds permit.  The contractor has consented to give a detailed estimate.  This broad outline only comes from five years’ involvement with the town I love and is aimed at one thing only; the preservation of the Burra Mine buildings.  I am willing to come to Burra at any time with the architect, building contractor and others who are offering help.

Burra Hospital has since 1929 been a part-time training centre for girls wishing to become nurses and has over the years prepared many for this career.  Under a scheme introduced in 1970 the Burra Burra Hospital was classified as a training school only for Enrolled Nurses – previously called Nurses Aids.  The matter has now been reviewed and the hospital can now accept student nurses – aiming to become Sisters as well as Enrolled Nurse Trainees.  From January 1972 student nurses will do one year at BBH and then transfer to RAH.  In her first year the student nurse will attend the RAH for three period (of 3, 4 and 5 weeks) to undertake instruction in Theory of Nursing.  From January 1972 entry level will be a pass in four subjects at Leaving level.  Enrolled Nurses do a one-year course, which includes two periods (4 weeks and 2 weeks) at Glenedon School of Nursing in Adelaide.  By 1972 it is expected entry requirements will be third year of High School.

E.T. Baulderstone writes:

The buildings in the old copper mine played an important part in the early days of SA and of mining in Australia.  They have been well publicised in recent years by the efforts of Mr Ian Auhl.  The Burra Corporation bought the mining area about ten years ago so that the relics could be restored to attract tourists.  Lack of finance has allowed little restoration, but extensive visits by tourists have occurred.

I like the suggestion by Mr Hope that the Morphett Shaft poppet head be restored.  I consider as many buildings as possible should be preserved and if this is not possible then the main round chimney stack should be placed as close as possible to Morphett’s poppet head.  I feel this should be a Commonwealth and State project, not just a local and SA project.  I agree with the District Clerk that local rates should not be used, but disagree that any royalties from the mine should have a low priority as far as restoration of historic items is concerned.  They should have a very high priority in this respect and he should realise the mine area was bought for historical and tourist purposes.  I trust the District Council will give the matter plenty of thought.  If any buildings are resited:

‘I hope they are placed in a position which will not spoil our pretty street, like the stone recently placed in Market Square.

Floods.  Thunderstorms in the Booborowie area dumped heavy falls of rain locally.  187 points at Booborowie and 380 at the home of Jeffery Wedding.  Other people reported falls in excess of two inches.  Near the Booborowie cemetery the Big Creek ran a banker and 17 inches of water flooded the home of Dawn Taylor.

Mr Ron Dewhirst’s Austin Lancer stalled when wires got wet and was pushed to higher ground, but when he returned some time later it was found ‘hanging in a tree’, having been washed downstream in a flash flood.  Water entered the home of Lindsay McWaters.  Les Thomas reported 78 points at Mt Bryan East, but Burra recorded only 22.

S.J. Woollacott writes endorsing the desirability of launching a fund to save the old mine buildings and also that it be administered by the Burra Branch of the National Trust so that donations would be tax deductible.  He appeals for widespread support, repeating the oft-used phrase ‘Burra once saved South Australia’ – now it is time for South Australians to save part of Burra.  He was willing to start the fund with a donation of $5.00.

Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust: Annual Report.

An important event was the open day at Princess Royal thanks to Mr & Mrs Andrew Tennant.  It is much as it was when built in 1864 and approximately 800 people visited it.  Mr Downer operated a five-in-hand drag to take passengers to and from Burra and for short rides around the grounds.  It was decided to use the money raised on the dugouts project.  A contract has been lent to Mr Jacka to do the restoration work and planting of native trees and shrubs has begun.

On 29 August the Australian Railway Historical Society ran a special train to Burra for the centenary of the line and we were fortunate to have a display of Maurice Perry’s pencil sketches from the Burra Sketchbook in the RSL Hall along with items by the Art Group.  Tours of the town were arranged with Trust members as guides.

Mr Auhl also conducted a Living History School for Mid North Adult Education with an address and tour.  Approximately 50 attended.

We regret to record the death of J.R. Barker and in accordance with his wishes the Misses Brown have offered the branch several horse drawn vehicles, which are presently housed in the Bon Accord Buildings.  When these buildings become available it is hoped to form another museum there for agricultural implements and the stud Merino industry.  Mr Edwards Group (from SA Museum) has agreed to erect an Aboriginal artefact display in another room.  Considerable work is needed on the buildings before this can be done.

Of major concern now is the preservation of old mine buildings with Samin Ltd now at work on the site.

The Museum in Market Square has had about 2,500 paying visitors this year.

Burra Sketchbook sales have been c. 600.  We have also printed Historic Perspective of Burra by Ian Auhl – a paper given by Mr Auhl at an Adult Education seminar in Adelaide.

Burra Mine

Last Friday exploratory talks were held in the office of the Director of Mines Mr L. Parkin re the removal and resiting of Graves’ Pump House and Peacock’s Pump House and Chimney.  The meeting was initiated by the National Trust in response to a request from Mr B.R. Lewis Chairman of Directors of Samin Ltd, that any interest in doing this movement of buildings should be expressed as soon as possible.

Mr Auhl’s ‘Course of Action’ letter was the basis of the discussion.  Present were:

Director of the SA National Trust Mr Ashley Cooper

Mr Roberts representing Samin Ltd

Mr Ian Auhl representing the Burra Branch of the National Trust

Dr Grant Inglis Protector of Historical Relics as observer.

Mr Roberts said Samin was not yet producing an income and was there fore not in a position to spend shareholders’ money, but they were prepared to offer mechanical help – making available machinery on the site and to help in the demolition and transport of masonry to sites for proposed rebuilding.  This was considered a valuable offer.

Mr Auhl outlined the reason for having submitted his plan.  Success depended on the State Government and public support.  Dr Grant Inglis considered there had in the past been a lack of adequate liaison between the National Trust, the District Council and Samin.  All agreed that this was important.

The proposed sites for relocation were then discussed.

An offer from Mr G. O’Connor of a site close to the Mine Entrance was noted and acclaimed.

The Burra Burra DC also was considering making another site available.

All parties agreed the first priority was the chimney stack.  Second came Graves’ Pump House and 3rd Peacock’s Pump House.  The Director of Mines in summing up stressed the need for action in the next few weeks.  Mining developments would make it difficult to remove buildings within the next month or so.

Telephones.  Extra trunk lines will be available from 17 March.

New Freeling-Kapunda Road

The new sealed road between Freeling and Kapunda was opened to traffic on 15 March.  The new road cuts three miles from the route via Greenock and has fewer bends and easier grades.  It also has the advantage of not cutting through built up areas.

Burra Mine Buildings Preservation Committee

A three hour meeting was held in Burra last Friday evening.  Mr H. Rich of Samin outlined what help the company could give.  He outlined what they had done at Cobar in restoration and setting up of a local museum.  He stressed the urgent need for action and outlined the time limits.  Mr Auhl was asked to report on steps taken to implement the course of action.

At a personal interview with National Trust President Mr Berry the President had offered the support of the National Trust executive.  This means an appeal can be launched by the Trust and donations will be tax deductible.

On 17 March the supervising architect Mr G. Krause and official Trust photographer Mrs Barbara Toope will make their survey of the buildings concerned.  This work is on a voluntary basis.  Mr Rich is giving access to the buildings.

Builder Mr Geoff Lloyd was prepared to undertake the demolition and reconstruction on a cost plus basis.  He is a master builder recommended by Mr K. Gill of the Master Builders Association.  He knows the Burra buildings well and will co-operate with all voluntary help that can lower costs.

The Master Builders Association has recommended the engagement by Mr Lloyd of a Danish steeplejack now resident in SA and he and Mr Lloyd will visit Burra in the next fortnight to assess methods of demolition and reconstruction.

The Committee then considered other matters:

Access to site

Priorities 1 & 2 Peacock’s Chimney and Graves’ Pump House.  Priority 3 Peacock’s Pump House was not thought tenable.  Stone from here would be needed by Samin for repairs to the Powder Magazine and by builders to replace stone in other buildings.

The site offered by Mr G. O’Connor near the Mine entrance was accepted as appropriate and would give Burra a complete Cornish Unit of a chimney and Pump House in an appropriate area.  Also the area could then become malineable [sic: but not found in OED.] as the property of the National Trust.

Publicity.  Much free publicity seems on present indications to be available in the media.  It is clear that with the all round help being given, the scheme has moved, within a few weeks, from possible to probable and now to certainty.

Burra Burra DC, 2 March

Following objections from C.P. Thamm and Brian Thamm it was decided not to proceed with the closure of Stronach Street.

Council resolved to borrow $20,000 from the Savings Bank of SA by means of a debenture loan for a period of 5 years at 7.1% p.a. interest.

Council said it was in favour of preserving as many of Burra historic buildings as would interest tourists, but the sum envisaged to resite the chimney and other mine buildings was beyond the Council’s resources.  It would make available a suitable site and render whatever assistance was possible.

There was a letter from Alexander re the closure of Elphick Street.  Plans to be signed.

Centenary of Ironmine Methodist Church

About 400 people attended the celebrations last Sunday.  Rev. C.L.H. Pitman a former minister in the Redruth Circuit preached the occasional address to a congregation which packed the church and overflowed into a covered area of shade outside.  The Burra Circuit Choir sang the anthem and Mrs Mavis Satchell sang a solo.  Luncheon was provided by the Ironmine Ladies.  In the afternoon people with a past association with the church were given the opportunity to speak and Mrs G. Murray and Mr N. Baynes were the first to contribute.  Afternoon tea followed.  The Trust Steward made a statement welcoming those who had returned for the occasion.

[Check who it says this was because in 93, 12, 30 Mar. 1971 a correction is made to say it was Ray Lloyd.]

The Lloyd family have been connected with the Ironmine Church for many years, my father holding the position of Trust Secretary for 25 years and I have held it since 1948.  Today not many families are left in the immediate locality who take an active interest in the church.  The congregation, small as it is, has looked forward to the centenary, the celebration of which is an ambitious undertaking. A letter received this week from retired Congregational Minister Rev. W.R. Trestrail says it was his grandfather, the late Philip Oates, who gave the land on which the church was built and that it was his late mother, Elizabeth Mary Oates, who played the organ when the church was opened.  It seems the Oates family featured well in the earliest days of this church’s life.  It is known that the father of Mr Percy Oates of Burra, the late John G. Oates, carted the first load of stone to the site.

An account of the first service came to light, preserved in a report in the SA Register.  It was actually opened in October – knowledge of this only came to light after the date had been fixed for the centenary.  The entry in the SA Register 10 October 1871 says:

At Iron Mine Gum Creek the opening sermons of the new Primitive Methodist Chapel were preached on Sunday 1 October 1871 by Rev. H.J. Pope, minister of the circuit, to large congregations.

On Monday the tea was well patronised by friends from all parts of the district.  Mr T. Hutchens presided and Mr T. Clapp gave an address on forming character and the perpetual freshness of Bible Truth and the necessity of Bible education.  Mr T. Pedler closed his speech with recitation on Christ’s commission.  Mr J. Barrows referred to the absurdity of remarks by grumblers who were perpetually regretting the lack of pulpit talent, power and faithfulness.  The Redruth Primitive Methodist Choir sang well chosen anthems.  The new chapel was built by Messrs J. & T. Pearce of Kooringa for a total cost of c. £140 and proceeds from the service were £40.

[A list of people apologising for being unable to attend the centenary follows and thanks are expressed for all those who made the occasion such a success.]

Early Bakers in Burra

[There had been some discussion about early bakers in the town, but I did not note it because it was vague and generally uninformative.  You will get some idea of the vagueness when I now note that one of the bakers had been referred to as Mr Holman or Hallman or Aulman.  This issue now says he was Mr Ullman, who at one time owned the property now known as ‘Stud Park’ at Mt Bryan and the land on which the Mongolata Gold Mine was later situated.  He was a bachelor and c. 1901 returned to visit his former home in Stuttgart, Germany, for a holiday and died aged 95 in Adelaide.  He was a great uncle of Mrs May Cox of Burra North.

It is difficult without further knowledge of the family to be sure about these facts, in part because bachelors leave few records and because I do not have easy access to relationships in Germany before migration.  But evidence from the Burra Record in 1902 suggests that Mr Ullman the baker operated in Kooringa on the corner of Bridge Terrace and Kingston Street from c. 1869 to 1902.  The landowner at Mt Bryan would seem to be Charles August William Ullman 1830-1891.  He and his wife died in November 1891 in an influenza epidemic.  May Cox was his granddaughter.  If the baker was a great uncle, he was a brother to C.A.W. Ullman, but this connection is not traceable in SA records.  The reference to the baker’s returning to Germany is verifiable from the Record:

XV, 529, 3 Sep. 1902, page 2

Kooringa Court, 30 August.

John Lines was charged on the information of Charles Ullmann, baker, with being unlawfully on the latter’s premises on the night of 29 August.  John Lines and James Knevitt entered Ullmann’s bakehouse in Kingston St and asked for a loaf of bread.  Ullmann said he didn’t have a loaf, but would give them a piece.  They then entered his bedroom and bread and a candle were thrown at him and one of the two then assaulted him.  Panes of his window were broken and later he noticed some buns and a white pudding were missing.

XV, 532, 24 Sep. 1902, page 3

Mr Ullmann, the baker, has been so upset by the assault on him that if he can dispose of his business he will return to Germany.

XV, 534, 8 Oct. 1902, page 2

C. Morgan, who carried on a bakery business for many years in Burra, has purchased the goodwill of Mr W. Ullmann’s business and intends to carry on the business in his own name.

Note that the paper refers to Mr Ullmann as Charles and W. Ullman.  There are other references to him as W.

There is only one Ullman registered in SA as dying aged 95: Frank Louis Ullman who was born 3 December 1874 at Kooringa and died 18 March 1970 at St Peters, residence College Park.  He was a son of C.A.W. Ullmann.  He could not have been the baker who had been in business in Kooringa by c. 1869 as stated in the Record:

XV, 534, 8 Oct. 1902, page 2. Mr Ullmann has been completely shattered by the recent assault and having lived alone in the baking business for over 33 years, has not had a complete night’s rest since.  He is going to Pt Pirie for a few weeks and then on to Germany via Sydney.

And

XV, 548, 14 Jan. 1903, page 3

Advt. Charles Morgan takes over the Kingston St Bakery from W. Ullmann after the latter’s 33 years in business.

It seems unlikely that Mr Ullmann the baker returned to SA.]

Mrs May Cox brought in an obituary for a pioneer of Burra, Mr Henry Nourse Thompson, who died at 2 a.m. on Monday morning 21 September 1908:

Obituary.  Henry Nourse Thompson, aged 82 years 6 months died at ‘Three Trees’ near Burra on 21 September 1908.  He was born 15 March 1826 at Kings Lynn, Norfolk and came to SA in 1852.  He was thus a colonist of 56 years.  He was an accountant at the Burra Mine and later storekeeper there.  He planted the Moreton Bay figs at the Mine Store.  (Only one now survives.)  He was a great friend of Josiah Thomas’s father and for that reason Mr Thomas took the deceased to live with him at Three Trees.  He was there for 40 years.  One of his legs was amputated when he was 12 years old owing to ‘white swelling’.  He was a well educated and widely read gentleman and was a relative of the Mine’s chief accountant, Mr Challener [sic] [Challoner]

Burra Burra Show Inc. AGM

Mr R. Mason was elected President.

There was a credit balance of $227.73 after paying $1,295 for the erection of the shearing shed for which donations of $1,044 had been received.  Mr Mason reported on the 1970 show, which was opened on 10 October by the Governor, Sir James Harrison.  The weather was fine, but gate takings were down $30 to $650.  The star attraction was the Mid North Shearing Championships, held for the first time in the new shearing shed.  Horses in Action attracted a record 514 entries.  The wool display was up to its usual high standard and a new event was the Honda Agricultural Motor Cycle Trials, which proved a great success.  Poultry and Birds also had record entries.  Burra & District Schools display was also of a high standard.  Industrial displays were numerous.  Thanks also go to Mrs Val Secombe for her work as secretary.

Accident.  On Monday last week a car driven by Miss Raelene Bottrell of Adelaide struck and killed four sheep near the Hanson Tanks.  They were owned by Mr Don Stockman.  Damage to the car exceeded $500.

Post Offices from next year will no longer be open for one hour on Easter Saturday and there will be no postal deliveries on that day.

Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

Representatives of Commonwealth Social Services attended a Board of Management meeting to set out facts relating to the homes as required by the Government.  It is hoped to begin construction soon on 16 units.  The committee has purchased the block of land next to the Burra Hospital from the Hospital Board and the adjoining block from Mr J.G. Carpenter.  This will give room to duplicate the original set of units should demand warrant it.  It is understood the minimum age of admission will be 60 for women and 65 for men and other details regarding costs etc. are yet to be finalised.

Burra Mine ‘Course of Action’

Work will begin within the next two weeks to dismantle the huge Cornish buildings which have stood for 120 years.  Mr G. Lloyd has been contracted to remove the buildings from their present sites.  He is a noted Adelaide builder known for his magnificent stonework around Adelaide and Sydney.  Mr Ian Auhl has been working tirelessly in bringing the project to this stage.

Burra Railway Station acquired a new ‘track-placer’ on Thursday.  This will enable shunting of loads of up to 180 tons.  Engines from goods trains had previously done this work and the change will reduce travel times for goods trains as a result.  Transfer of single trucks has long been done by a Loco Pulser, which has a single rubber tyred wheel driven by a JAP motor and is believed to be the last one in SA.  It has now been returned to Adelaide.

The Track-Placer is essentially a tractor with hydraulic hoist and a turntable attached underneath, a railway track coupling hydraulically operated at the front and back and a small pair of ‘railway’ wheels front and back, also hydraulically operated.  It can be used for normal road travelling and be driven up to the railway line at right angles, the hoist lowered to the ground and the vehicle raised and swung into position along the track.  The railway wheels are then lowered onto the line, the hoist raised and the Track-Placer is ready to do shunting.  The hydraulic coupling is raised to lift the front of the railway truck, placing sufficient weight on the front wheels of the Track-Placer to provide traction.  The rear wheels of the tractor will be raised above the railway line during shunting.

Fifty-two regular trains pass through Burra each week.  The office/control room at the station will undergo complete renewal in the next few weeks due to the white ant damage to flooring and cupboards.

Samin Ltd’s plant has now been commissioned and has a treatment capacity of 250-300 tones per day and is working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The stock pile is being roofed to reduce dust and keep ore dry during wet weather.  The finished product is a black powder of copper oxide assaying at 70% copper and will be shipped to smelters or to chemical plants.  Washed ore is loaded into five large tanks of some 350 tons capacity and subjected to four days of leaching with a 10% ammonia solution.  The solution containing some copper is pumped into the product recovery section where it is washed and steamed to recover any remaining copper and ammonia.  These washings are made up to strength by adding fresh ammonia and become the leach solution for the next tank of ore.  The copper rich solution is steamed or boiled in an evaporator and the ammonia is driven off and reclaimed in the scrubbing section, to be reused once the copper precipitates as copper oxide.  After steaming the evaporator is discharged into a thickening tank and the oxide settles to the bottom and the clear hot water overflows from the top of the tank to be used again.  Copper oxide is removed from the bottom of the tank as a black slurry and pumped to a continuous filter which removes most of the water, leaving a semi-dry cake of copper oxide.  In total 46 are employed at the mine and of the 10 staff members 5 are local.  Of the 21 employed on plant operation 16 are local and 15 are employed in quarrying.  When the fourth permanent Housing Trust home is completed two will be occupied by members of Samin and two by Roche Bros.

There are ten transportable houses; seven occupied by Samin employees and three by employees of Roche Bros.  The company has also bought three established houses in Burra, occupied by Messrs:

H. Rich, Operations Manager

A. McFarlane, Metallurgist and Mill Superintendent

N. Van Buuren, Works Maintenance Engineer.

Roche Bros have bought a Burra North home, which is occupied by Mr Lyle Quinn.

Burra Mine Buildings Preservation Fund

S.J. Woollacott started the fund with $500.  National Trust members have spent the last couple of weeks sending letters appealing for donations which are tax deductible.  Graves’ Pump House contains some 2,000 tons of stone.  Mr Ian Auhl points out a building similar to Graves’ was transferred from Kadina to Wallaroo in 1876 and they were commonly moved in Cornwall when an ore body was worked out – it being cheaper than quarrying and cutting new stone.

Burra Cub & Scout Group Committee is raising funds to erect a shower and toilet block at the hall.  A bottle drive is being held with a sorting day 17 April at the Burra North Depot.

Milton Edwards as President of the Group Committee reports on their second year:

They have solid backing and support.  Regular bottle drives would be sufficient to provide funds now that the initial needs have been met, but it has proved difficult to co-ordinate them and establish a routine.  The facilities at the Cub and Scout Halls have been improved and the change to ETSA power has been a great help.  A shower and toilet block is essential for weekend camping at the Halls.  The birthday social on 16 October was a wonderful success.  Thanks go especially to Secretary, Mr Peter Mengersen, Treasurer, Mr Bob Mason and Group Scout Master Mr Brian Ashdown.

Burra North Recreation Rooms were opened on Saturday night in unfavourable weather.  Burra Burra DC Mr R.J. Jeffery declared the rooms open.  President of the Aberdeen Football Club Mr Bruce Stockman hoped the rooms would be used for organised recreation.  The committee still has to raise about $1,200, having spent $2,500.  The AFC had donated $1,475 ($1,327 from the Women’s Auxiliary), the National Fitness Council $500 and the Basketball Club $300 to get the project started.  Mr Jeffery said there was some doubt about when the Aberdeen Football Club had been formed and 1911 had been suggested.  Mr Jeffery thought a much earlier date was needed, possibly 1896, as his father walked in from Copperhouse to play for it about that time.  Mr Stan Noske as President of the Mid North Football League added his congratulations to those of Mr Jeffery.  He appealed for people to enjoy the new facilities, but not to abuse them.  Mr Reed had been going to present Ivan Hirschausen with Life Membership of the Club, but was prevented by illness.  Mr Stockman made the presentation.  For her work, tolerance and time Mrs S. Scroop was also honoured with Life Membership.

[The paper’s reporting of football is rather erratic, which makes any history of the clubs in the town impossible to construct from this source.  There is a report of the formation of an Aberdeen Football Club in May 1881, but then no reports of matches until 1892.

From 1892 to 1897 there was an Aberdeen Club and a Burra Club.

In 1898 there is no mention of football in the town.

In 1899 there is one club: Burra.

In 1900 there seems to have been an Aberdeen Club and a Kooringa Club – although the former is once reported as Redruth and the latter occasionally called Burra.

In 1901 the Burra Club is mentioned, but not the Aberdeen.

In 1902 & 1903 there were three town clubs: Aberdeen, Kooringa (Burra) & Ramblers.

In 1904 there appears to have been no local competition and one game with Burra v. Clare.

From 1905 to 1912 there were three town clubs: Aberdeen, Kooringa & Ramblers.

In 1913 Ramblers merged with Kooringa to form Kooringa and Aberdeen continued, and a Light Horse Club was formed.

These three continued for 1914, though the Light Horse had to forfeit its matches after the 1st Semi-Final due to the outbreak of WWI.

In 1915 Kooringa & Light Horse merged to form Kooringa and Aberdeen continued.

1916-1918 Kooringa & Aberdeen were in recess due to WWI, though an occasional game was played for patriotic causes.

1919-1924 the two town teams were Kooringa & Aberdeen.

1925 & 1926 saw three town teams: Kooringa, Aberdeen & Ramblers.

1927-1929 there were two town teams: Aberdeen & Ramblers.

From 1930 to 1933 the two town teams were Aberdeen & Kooringa.

After that there was one town team called Kooringa and later Burra until Aberdeen was re-established in 1961.  The variations in the Associations within which these teams played are even more complicated]

Burra Mine: The Powder Magazine

What is the evidence for its erection in 1847?

Ian Auhl forwards copies of the letters written at the time by Thomas Burr, Superintendent of the Burra Burra Mine, to the Directors in Adelaide.

Letter 1: 18 September 1847

The plan and sections of the new powder magazine have been drawn by me and in a day or two the builder will give an estimate.  Dimensions are 12 ft x 20 ft x 6 ft to the springing of the arch, which is semi-circular.  Side walls are to be 2” in thickness and the end walls 2 feet.  [Sic: this must be an error, presumably for 2 ft.]  To be roofed in slate.  [Auhl says this was an overall roof – long since dismantled.]

I will forward plans as soon as I can make duplicates, but given the heat and the unsafe nature of the present structure and situation, I will proceed with the new one without delay.  To secure life and property I advise that shoes of a peculiar construction be made forthwith (three or more pairs) for use of those visiting the magazine or engaged in moving powder.  To be made of soft leather and fitting like a sock.  Having visited the magazine and seen loose powder scattered on sandy and gravely floor, it is apparent a most disastrous consequence might ensue with total destruction of the workings and great loss of life.

Letter 2.  20 September 1847.

I have marked out the site and work will commence at once and should be done in a month.  Site chosen is on top of a hill in front of this house.  (Auhl says that is the Mine Manager’s residence – now destroyed.)  From its commanding view it will be a landmark and will be well ventilated.

Letter 3.  25 November 1847.

I would be obliged if you would expedite the sheeves (i.e. the slates) as the building cannot be completed without them.  I wish to have the powder moved before the height of summer and we usually get a day or two of rain at the end of November or early December, which would be a good time to move it.

The sheeves arrived and the powder was moved early in December 1847.

Evidence for the laying out of Kooringa in 1845.

See SA Register 18 October 1845 and Minutes of the Directors of SAMA Saturday 18 October 1845.  Directors intend immediately to accompany Captain Ey and Messrs Dreyer & son to the Mine to make arrangements for the erection of a smelting house and to select the site for a township.

Saturday 22 November 1845.

Site for the smelting house has been selected and one street of the township has been laid out.  Different names for the township were considered.  The first suggestion of the Directors was Redruth and the second was Truro.  On 4 November 1845 the name Kooringa was chosen.  The first hotel was erected and licensed in 1846, later the old hospital, which was knocked down a few years ago to make way for the new hospital wing.

During the commissioning stages of the plant there have been some problems, but Mr Harry Rich thinks these have now been ironed out.  The original aim was to produce 2.5 tons of copper oxide per day.  One day in the commissioning stages they produced 3.5 tons.

The product that is scraped from the filters is deposited in 44 gallon drums, each weighing half a ton.  It is expected the plant will be able to ship out 70-80 drums each fortnight, representing 35 to 40 tons of copper oxide.  The actual copper content is 75%.  At present the material being treated is from the dump, from the previous mining operations.  The roofing over the stockpile at the crusher is nearing completion.

Peacock’s Chimney has now been completely dismantled and carted to the new site and the foundation is being dug there.

Moving House

A house 27 ft x 19.5 ft high was moved to Burra last weekend.  It had lain empty for some years near the main Adelaide Road near the Holme Hill turn-off.  It was placed on a low loader on Sunday and escorted by Constable Miller of Burra.  On the main road every overhead telephone line had to be lifted over the house.  At Burra the idea was to enter the town via Burra North and Smelts Road to Mr & Mrs N. Fuller’s property south of the cemetery, but the load was unable to negotiate the narrow bridge on Ayers Street, south of Welsh Place.  The next idea was to travel behind the hospital, up Kangaroo Street and then down to the Pig and Whistle Crossing and along Ayers Street.  Except for a few tree branches and wires all went as planned until the load slipped at the turn at the top of the hill and slid gently to the ground.  Not much damage was done, but it took from 1.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. before it was reloaded and it was dark by the time the load reached Thames Street.  The area was closed to traffic for the night and the journey began again at 7.30 a.m. on Monday.  The ford was safely crossed and the home was at its new site by 10.30 a.m.

Burra Burra DC.  Because of insufficient office accommodation the Council is considering enlarging the present building, or making some modified additions to the Town Hall.

Caravan Park.  Plans have been accepted for the second caravan park to be located opposite the present park and swimming pool.  Tenders have been called for an amenities block and installation of power and water points.  D.T. Jacka’s tender has been accepted.  Council has applied for a grant of $4,000 for this purpose.  The park, of proceeded with, will accommodate 20 vans and will be screened from the road by trees, now ready to be planted.  The present park has earned $2,200 this financial year, making it a payable proposition.

Morgan Road.  The realignment of the road in the vicinity of Klaebe’s Creek is being supported by grant money and should be completed in the next financial year – probably in August.

Burra Mine.  Peacock’s Pump House was demolished on 4 June.  It had stood for over a century before being blown up.  The adjacent chimney has already been removed for resiting at the Mine entrance on the main road.  The explosives were arranged to do as little damage to the actual stones as possible.  There is still time to save Graves’ Pump House.  It can be re-erected on the site by the main road where the chimney is to stand.  The lack of support from local people is staggering and the apparent indifference is saddening.

‘It is imperative that we save what we can and see that the skill of those Cornish stone masons doesn’t become just a memory and a legend.’

Peter C. Morris of Niusawa School, Fiji, writes with information about the story of Rev. Jennison in Fiji and with the suggestion that H.J.B. Jennison had been born in the house that the writer presently occupied.  He had some information from a young New Zealand student doing research on missionary correspondence in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Rev. J.C. Jennison was the resident missionary on Taveuni in the 1890s to at least 1905.  Until 1900 the mission was based at Vuna on the southern end of Taveuni because it was furthest from the warlike chief of Somosomo.  In 1899 the church decided to relocate to the northern section and purchased the plantation named Niusawa.  This was a narrow strip only 17 chains wide, but extending up the mountain for about 3 miles, to give an area of over 400 acres.  Rev. Jennison and family moved into the previous home of the plantation owner in 1900.  It was in a very poor condition and close to the sea.  A new house was begun in 1901.  By February 1902 they had moved into the house while part was still under construction.  The house was 66 ft wide x 56 ft deep, with half a dozen rooms and a 10 ft 6 inch wide verandah.  So H.J.B. was not born at Niusawa, but spent some of his earliest years there.  The house has not been much changed despite some modifications in the 1930s.  The surroundings have, however, been transformed.  It is surrounded by the buildings of a large secondary school accommodating nearly 400 children from class 1 to Form 5 (equivalent of Leaving Standard).  Almost 150 secondary students live in the school hostel on the site.  The buildings are arranged around the playing field and the school serves a large area of Fiji.  Students are a mixture of Fijians and Indians as well as from the islands, with a few Chinese and part-Europeans.

Editor: Peter Morris is a former member of staff of Burra High School and his wife was born Antoinette Harris, daughter of Mr & Mrs V.R. Harris of Booborowie.

The Clare-Spalding Railway

Mr E.C. Allen MP has warned that this line may close in the near future.  Following sharp increases in freight costs in 1966, which added about 3c per bushel in the district, much grain transport has moved to road.  Also transporting grain 50 miles to Pt Pirie is cheaper than using the rail for over 100 miles to Pt Adelaide.  Andrews is the only rail grain terminal north of Clare.  Passenger services were discontinued about 14 years ago.

Burra Mine

245 representatives from the Adelaide Regional Conference of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy visited Burra on Sunday.  [Key members are named.]  The Samin Ltd plant was inspected, followed by a buffet lunch at the Town Hall organised by ladies of the Burra Primary School Welfare Club, with drinks from the Commercial Hotel.  After lunch the visitors were shown around the open cut and other historic town sites.  Market research by Samin shows the copper oxide product is likely to find a market as an ingredient in fertilizers.  This will require a drying kiln to reduce the moisture content from the present 10% to 1%.

Burra Hospital.  The annual meeting was held on Thursday night.

Chairman Mr R.K. Pearse said the board was preparing for a major building program including a new maternity wing, private, share, and children’s rooms as well as a kitchen and toilet block on the same level as the present building.  The Barker Cottage Home Project will be carried out at the same time.  He reported a surplus of $10,424, a credit balance in all accounts of $22,807 and investments of $25,000.  The overdraft had been liquidated.  The daily patient number averaged 20.3 – the highest for 20 years and 52 babies had been born.  This resulted in a better financial position.  The Chief Secretary has advised that a subsidy is available for the building project.  The cropping program had yielded $191.

The Auxiliary again did fine work on maintaining the linen and supplying jams and preserves.  The fund-raising committee donated $1,027 this year.  From 27 July the hospital kitchen had supplied food for Meals on Wheels.  Matron Fyfe’s excellent service had continued, helped by Sisters Moller, Byles, Brown and Ward and by part-time Sisters Carmody and Jones, assisted by a full compliment of nurses.

St Mary’s Service

The Anglican Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier will attend the St Mary’s service on Sunday, as will former Rector, Arch-Deacon Ross Lenthall.  Former organist Clem Davey will play the organ.

The Bishop will dedicate two memorials:

The set of bookshelves in the porch in memory of the late Guy Dollman and his wife Doris Mary Dollman.

An aumbry placed over the chapel altar to house the sacrament for the communion of the sick will honour the late Bishop Donald Llewellyn Redding, Rector of Burra 1933-39.

The Ven. Arch-Deacon Lenthall (Rector 1953-58) will be guest preacher who had a long association with Mr & Mrs Dollman and with Bishop Redding.  The aumbry has been designed by Mr N.C. Rohrlach of Whyalla who also designed the Sanctuary lamp some time ago.  A parish lunch will follow in the RSL Hall.

St Mary’s Church.  Service of Dedication

The dedication of the bookshelves and aumbry [see last issue pages 6 & 7 for further details] was done by the Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier who then celebrated Holy Communion with the assistance of the Rector Fr John Stephenson, the visiting Rector of Christ Church Mt Gambier and the Arch-Deacon of The Murray the Ven. L.R. Lenthall.  Fr Lenthall gave the address outlining the service to the church and community of Mr & Mrs Dollman and the career of Bishop Redding.  All members of the Dollman family were able to be present: Frances Mrs breeze of Adelaide, Helen Mrs Clark of Adelaide, June Mrs Burdon of Burnie Tasmania, Peg Mrs Stephenson of Redcliffe Brisbane and Guy of Burra.

Clem Davey played a brilliant fanfare and sympathetic accompaniment.

The bookshelves were made by Mr Dudley Jacka, but unfortunately a family bereavement prevented him from attending.

The aumbry was designed by N. Rohrlach of Whyalla who attended with his wife and the steelwork of the aumbry safe was fabricated by Mr R.L. Thamm.  Beaten brasswork overlays the safe and this was the work of Adelaide silversmith John Hale.  The late delivery of the safe prevented its being lined with silk, but this will be done as soon as possible.  The front panel depicts the Lamb of God and on this occasion it is portrayed as a stud Merino ram.  The luncheon at the RSL Hall was attended by more than half the congregation.  The Bishop and family stayed overnight and intended to have a barbecue at he World’s End Gorge the next day, but rain prevented this.

Weather.  The eastern pastoral country reports generally useful falls – many between 60 and 80 points.

Willalo Rural School will be closed at the end of 1971 as one of 23 small rural schools to close this year.  A school bus run will replace it.

Thomas Pickett Memorial.  On Wednesday the plaque fixed to a counterweight from the old mine workings was dedicated by S.J. Woollacott to the shepherd, Thomas Pickett, who discovered the Burra Mine.  Burra School children were among those who witnessed the event near Diprose Creek opposite the remains of Pickett’s hut.

Woollacott made the dedication and Mr Warren Bonython moved the vote of thanks to the Burra Burra Branch.  [Auhl’s speech is printed.]

Pickett came to the area in 1842 to live in his shepherd’s hut alongside the springs in Diprose creek.  There had been no memorial in Burra to the Cornish Miners, or to the Welsh or German Smelters until a recent memorial in Market Square.  Burra was for twenty years SA’s second largest town with a peal population of 5,000 and was for 12 years SA’s only industrial town, with its smelting works.  The present Government seems to favour Wallaroo, Kadina and Moonta as SA’s historic towns, but Burra contains the greatest collection of original buildings still in existence of any town in Sa and has Australia’s oldest mining buildings.  Captain Hancock came to Burra to get his first Moonta miners and the first Headmaster of Moonta Mines School was an old Burra boy Dr William Toor [sic: for Torr].  The scene her is little changed from 1842 when Pickett lived here.  Only a few stones of his hut now remain.

Colonel Frome, SA’s Surveyor General would have seen it when he passed in 1842.  Once a month Pickett would yoke up his bullocks and go to Gum Creek Station 14 miles away to report to the Station manager William Robinson, get his stores, tobacco and rum and return to his hut.  He was paid 12/- a week, most of which went to pay for his rations.  The nearest village was then Gawler 75 miles away, with just nine houses.  Pickett’s hut was then the furthest dwelling north.  Another shepherd, William Streair lived eight miles south, where Princes Royal Homestead now stands and where some Indian coolies also worked for the leaseholder Mr James Stein.  Both shepherds learnt to recognise copper ore after the Kapunda Mine opened in 1843 and in 1845 both found it, but all they ever made of the discovery was £20 each.

[Auhl had documented Pickett’s story in a booklet published by the Burra National Trust and which was given to most of those present.]

Pickett’s story is one of almost unbelievable meanness on the part of the proprietors of the SA Mining Association.  The Burra Mine began on 29 September 1845 and closed on 29 September 1877.  Pickett showed his discovery to a group who had ridden north to see Streair’s find.  He was paid £10 for revealing the site.  A month later the 20,000 acres had been paid for and surveyed.  At the mine’s opening ten miners were present:

Robert Mitchell	Grant

Gillard	R. Jones Jnr

Jenkins	R. Jones Sen

William Roberts	I. Crillas (a blacksmith to sharpen picks)

Jonathon Roberts	Carter

Thomas Roberts was in charge and was appointed Captain at 35/- a week.

The first load was a two-ton lump of red oxide that assayed at 71¼% copper.

Pickett lives a further six years and died 18 November 1851 of accidental burns in a hut near the present crossing of the Baldina creek.  He was given a pauper’s burial in the old Burra Cemetery.  On an appeal from Mr Ware, the owner of the present Burra Hotel (then called the Miners’ Arms) the SA Mining Association forwarded 5 guineas to cover the funeral expenses.  Today at long last the discoverer of the Burra Mine is being honoured.

[Mr Auhl then referred to several letters he had received from descendents of the first miners.]

Mr Stanley Woollacott then dedicated the plaque to Thomas Pickett and Mr Warren Bonython then moved a vote of thanks to the Burra Burra Branch of the National Trust in his capacity as President of the National Trust of SA.

Burra Mine

Sales of copper oxide are satisfactory on both local and the overseas markets.  One hundred and forty-three thousand pounds have been produced since 30 June.  Stage 1 of construction at the Mine has been completed.  Design and stage two of the operation has proceeded.  Pilot plant tests have been partially completed to enable the selection of a final design for the roasting plant.  Stage 2 will see production of ore rise to 1,000 tons per day.  Recently installed drying equipment is operating satisfactorily.  Samin Ltd and Roche Bros have agreed to supply the Burra Burra DC with metal for road making.  The existing Council quarry has almost been cleaned out.  The new supplies will come from the northern open cut section, which will not be mined in Stage 1 of operations.

The late Lily Owen Smyth has been remembered with a fine plaque at the Hallett Institute.  It was unveiled during the Red Cross Flower Show by Chairman of the District Council Mr Eric Ashby.  She worked on many organisations and committees and especially for Red Cross.

John Baker the Burra Bushranger by Ian Auhl: Part 1.

Baker was arrested on Monday 16 October 1871 outside the Burra Court House.  There was a price on his head.  He was arrested by Lance Cpl Smith and Constable Noble.  The charge was horse stealing and robbery under arms, which carried a sentence of death by hanging.  He had eluded police for two years in the Barrier Ranges, so why had he come to Burra?  There was always a touch of bravado about him.  He had stood trial at the Supreme Court in Adelaide in August 1866 aged 21 on a charge of horse stealing.  The judge took the view that his reasons for taking the horse were at least plausible and the police could be driving him into a life of crime.  He was acquitted and released.  He immediately stole a horse from the Napoleon Hotel and headed to Glenelg.  The police caught up with him five weeks later in NSW and this time the judge sided with the police.  In his teenage years he had worked at the Cross Roads Inn [near Burra] grooming and caring for travellers and coaches.  Then he was employed by the Burra firm of McDonald & Hosking breaking in horses for their northern mail runs.  He was described as a ‘smallish man, very active and a daring rider’.  He liked horses and objected vehemently when a trooper ill-treated his horse.

After leaving Burra he spent a few years around Gawler and Adelaide, apparently making a living collecting stray horses and returning them to their owners.  It was when he began ‘collecting’ them from their owners’ paddocks and from public pounds that he struck trouble.  Such behaviour saw him facing court aged 21.  His sentence some five weeks later following his capture in NSW was one year’s hard labour at the Dry Creek Stockade (Yatala Prison).  It was there that he met another horse thief ‘Billy’ Bertram and probably formed the partnership which ended in Bertram’s hanging at Bathurst Gaol in 1871 and Baker’s own arrest at Burra later in that year.

Bertram was a German with a lisp and one eye and was an ex-Tungkillo butcher who had talent and notoriety as a cattle thief and it was his carelessness in leaving a cow’s tail in his yard that led to a conviction for stealing free meat and a sentence in the stockade at the same time as Baker.

After their release Baker and Bertram continued their life of petty crime in the hills around Gumeracha and out to the River Murray.  When SA got too hot for them they headed north up the Darling to the Barrier Ranges.  In the 1860s this became the haunt of cattle duffers, bushrangers and other undesirables.  The notorious Morgan and Captain Thunderbolt paid a few visits to this frontier area.  Baker and Bertram operated unhindered for a while with water and hiding places readily available.  In October 1869 Baker was charged at Wilcannia with three assaults: one on a boarding-house keeper and two on the NSW constables who arrested him.  He was fined $14.  Mr Bellamy, an admirer of pluck, raised the fine money from Baker’s admirers.  The next morning four horses, the property of Mt Murchison Station, were missing.  The outlaws always had plenty of sympathisers, which explains some of the cockiness and cool daring common to bushrangers in general.  A few days later Baker and Bertram held up the manager of Mt Arrowsmith Station, Mr George Urquhart and took horses and stores.  Station hands and shearers looked on.  The partners began to hold a contempt for law and the police that would lead to their downfall.

By November 1869 they were labelled ‘The Darling Bushrangers’.  On 9 November they bailed up a hawker Charles Young and when he asked who they were Bertram boasted that he was Billy Bertram who had robbed O’Brien and taken four horses from Murchison Station.  After threatening to blow out his brains, they robbed Young of $100 and rifled his van for guns and stores.  This made them guilty of robbery under arms, leading to their being declared outlaws, each with a price of $100 on his head.  After robbing Young they separated.

Bertram was finally captured late in 1870 near Cobham Lake where he was living in an Aboriginal camp.  By this time he was wanted for murder, having killed the same Charles Young he had previously threatened.  He was tried at Wilcannia and hanged at Bathurst Gaol early in 1871.

Baker eluded police for nearly two years and was undone by his arrogance.  L-Cpl Smith heard news that Baker was en route from the Barrier Ranges with a small band of stolen horses.  He had known Baker a few years earlier at Burra.  Baker, travelling without disguise, arrived after dark on Sunday evening.  On Monday he went to the barber’s shop in Kooringa [In 1971 Bert Beinke’s Paper and Book Shop] and asked for a hair cut and to have his hair dyed red.  The barber refused to dye it and Baker abused the barber for taking so long about cutting it.  Baker then walked to Redruth with two other men and sat down outside the court to cut up tobacco for his pipe.  The court was a cheap source of entertainment for idlers, sight-seers and moral busy-bodies in Victorian times and so the place was crowded.  When Smith and Noble approached him and declared he was arrested, Baker attempted to escape, but was chased and brought back.

He was placed in one of the cells behind the police station after a violent struggle.  They found a revolver in his swag, but no arms on his person.  The next day he was taken to Redruth Gaol and within a few days was planning his escape.  [To be continued.]

Publicly Examined Leaving & Matriculation

The Hon. M.B. Cameron asked a question in Parliament about what could be done to change the situation where employers were not recognising internally assessed courses to the detriment of many students.  The Hon. T.M. Casey in reply acknowledged the difficulty and suggested there would soon be a committee established to investigate alternatives to the PEB Leaving and Matriculation examinations.  The alternative would put every student more or less on an equal footing, removing the distinction between internal and externally examined certificates.

Burra & Tourism

Mr J. O’Sullivan of Australia National Travel Association inspected tourist attractions and Samin Ltd operations at Burra last week.  He met Council representatives and various groups forming the Burra & District Tourist Promotion Committee.  He said Burra was ideally situated to exploit its great historical heritage and well situated on a sealed route to Broken Hill and the Flinders Ranges.  It would greatly benefit from the sealing of the Burra-Morgan Road and the Burra-Spalding Road to form the east-west link across the country.  The potential for tourist development was virtually untouched.

The Bushranger Baker (Continued) By Ian Auhl.

A report from the SA Register newspaper of 30 October 1871.

The desperado was held in Redruth Gaol.  A man named Dolson also in prison on a charge of horse stealing managed to feign illness and was placed nearer to Baker, doubtless in order to speak to him.

Gaoler Perry overheard the pair planning to escape by forcing a hole in a lath and plaster ceiling with a wooden ford and thence to remove a sheet of roofing iron to effect an escape.  Perry heard them wrench a form from its mortice and replace it, preparatory to the escape.  Next day he placed the men in irons.  On Monday a search found that Dolson had concealed a hammer in his boot.  Baker asserted his intention to escape on his overland journey to NSW, where he faced charges of stealing four horses from Mt Murchison, robbery under arms at Cobham’s Station and theft of a revolver, gun and 4 or 5 horses.  A man named Edwards and Mr Curtis of the Pig & Whistle Inn at Kooringa was there at the time.  Bertram, who had since been hanged, was with him and was foremost in the action while Baker kept guard.  The horses on which he came down were stolen from O’Leary in the North East, the owner residing at Pallammicca.  On his way down from the Barrier Ranges the bushranger had 2 revolvers conspicuously in his belt and £3 given him by a hawker and it is said others also handed him money.  On his way to Burra he proposed to a person well known in Kooringa to join him and they would soon make £200 or £300 each.

(Paper report ends.)

Baker was taken from Redruth Gaol in November and escorted to Adelaide.  The judge in Adelaide heard the charge and ordered him taken to Wilcannia for trial, in the custody of Constable Murphy.  He was placed in irons and travelled to Kapunda by rail and thence to Wentworth on the Murray for delivery to the NSW police.  Murphy had little sleep on the four day journey and handed the bushranger over to Constable Makin of Booligal for transfer to Wilcannia.  On 18 December he was tried at Wilcannia in a crowded court.

Baker remained alert and defiant and put on the appearance of impudent bravado.  He cross-examined each witness and complained to the judge about brutal treatment from his police escort.  He was found guilty and remanded to Bourke for sentence.  Constable Murphy was again in charge of the transfer by coach for 200 miles.

It is reported that at Dasham and McGovern’s Tankarooka Station 75 miles up the Darling River he attempted to escape, although chained.  He broke the handcuffs, struck Murphy twice on the Temple and kicked him in the stomach.  Murphy got him by the throat and held him down and was assisted by Captain Parker of the steamer Kennedy.  Baker’s hands were then strapped behind his back.  He was placed in the mail conveyance and after some time, at the prisoner’s entreaty, his hands were released.  They reached Bourke on Sunday between 3 and 4 p.m.  Constable Murphy deserves great praise for his pluck and skill in handling such a ruffian.

Baker served three years hard labour at Bourke.  The robbery under arms charge had been dropped, as it was the late William Bertram who had pointed the revolver each time.  As far as can be discovered his bushranging days finished at Bourke.

Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes

Approval has been given for the drawing up of specifications for the erection of nine cottage homes on the site west of the Burra Hospital.  The architects will now draw up plans and specifications for submission to Federal and State authorities for subsidy approval.  The late J.R. Barker bequeathed $70,000 for the project and nominated a board comprising: R.K. Pearse, R.B. Jennison, Mrs L.M. Fyfe, Mrs M. Odgers, E.J. Ashby, J. Dewhirst, D.M. Bednall, J. Gordon, M. Carmody, R. Reed and L.H. Packer as Administrator.

The nine cottages will be self contained and run east-west parallel to the main road.  Each will be air conditioned with a bedroom, kitchen-lounge, laundry, toilet and front verandah, carport and garden space.  They can be used as double or single units.  In the event of more applicants than there are vacancies preference will be given to residents or persons with an association with the area within the District Councils of Burra, Hallett and Robertstown.  Rental is estimated to be $12 for a double unit and $8 for a single, payable fortnightly in advance.  Occupants are to pay for telephones, electricity and power.  The board will pay rates and taxes and maintenance.  Standard built-in furniture will be supplied and a washing machine, electric range, refrigerator, air conditioner, wall heater, curtains, floor coverings, beds, mattresses, pillows and bed spreads.  Any gift or donation on occupancy would be appreciated, but is not a requirement, nor will it affect priority of acceptance.  It is expected that tenders for erection work will be called soon.

The Anglican Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier will officiate at Burra 19 December.  He will conduct four services.

In 60 years the school had an average attendance of 14.  In 1947 after many years of petitioning a new school was provided after strong support from Mr P.H. Quirke, a former MP.  This little school was well equipped and it is with regret that it is being closed and in the New Year a bus will provide a round-about 17 mile long daily trip to Booborowie School.  Tom Ashby and Keith Hanlin reminisced before an adjournment to the hall for luncheon.

Burra High School Speech Night

[The 1971 prize list is printed.]

Dux of the school was Andrew Webster (Leaving Class).  [Personal interest: First in Class 1A was Brenda Harris.]

The Headmaster presented his third and the school’s 59th annual report.

He welcomed Professor Flentje who was the guest speaker.

The Report

At the start of the year there were 174 pupils, one less than at the start of 1970.  During the year about 20 pupils left, mainly due to transfer of parents from the town.  One extra staff member was appointed this year, which enabled some combined subjects to be split.  There are now 12 full-time staff.

[Staff duties and changes through the year were then detailed.]

The election due for the High School Council this year was deferred pending a decision on the form and function of the Council following the Karmel Report Recommendations.

Councillors and the ladies in the Parents & Friends’ Association have given the school great support and are thanked for it.  Parents & Friends’ Assoc. will conduct a sale of second-hand school uniforms during the Learn-to-Swim Campaign in January.  The four pie, pasty and soup days raised considerable money and a record amount was taken at the school ball.  I would enter a plea for more mothers to attend the regular meetings and to spread the work load.

Purchases this year were fewer due to some uncertainties about subsidies, which have only just been resolved.  Nevertheless the year saw over $200 spent on library books, two Maths Laboratory Kits, a kit to aid spelling and nine sets of headphones for a listening post.  The Parents & Friends’ Association’s healthy bank balance will be needed when the school moves to its new position and some items will no longer be shared with the Primary School.

The plans for the new school have been sighted and were forwarded to the Public Works Standing Committee in September.  The new school envisages open unit class areas, an activity room, facilities for typing, home science, needlework, woodwork, metalwork, and art as well as a library and assembly hall and change room facilities for physical education.  Meanwhile an annex to the Science Laboratory and installation of ceiling fans in wooden buildings has improved the existing school.

Excursions this year included Adelaide, Flinders Ranges, World’s End creek, River Murray irrigation and packing systems and Wirrabara Forest, as well as several local visits, including to the Mine.  The usual sporting activities were held through the year, including a Swimming Carnival and a Sports Day.  The Interschool Athletics were successfully held on the second attempt after being washed out on the first.  Burra came second in the Handicap Shield for the third year in succession.  There was also a lightning carnival for winter sports.

I pay tribute to all those teachers and parents who put in so much extra time to make the school’s sporting activities successful and thank the Burra Burra DC for use of the town oval and the Aberdeen Tennis Club and the Convent for the use of their courts and the Burra Primary School for use of their facilities.

The Leaving PEB results last year were good and the 88% Grade IV or better subject results compere with 75% state-wide.  Two third year students have recently been awarded Commonwealth Scholarships: Monica Hillman and Michael Carmody.  Two Leaving students won Commonwealth Technical Scholarships: Ann Hillman & Russell Disher.  Next year French will flow to third year after a successful start in the first two years.  A scheme to enable ‘2’ track students to do a limited Leaving in Burra from 1973 will be continued.  (Limited in the sense that their subject choice will be limited to subjects chosen for them.)  Staff transfers known at present are:

Mr West to Blackwood

Mr Salt to Christies Beach

Miss Pfitzner to Northfield

Mrs Allen is resigning from teaching

Miss Helbig to Murray Bridge

[The Headmaster then thanked the school prefects and house leaders and other students who carried out a range of services.]

Thanks also go to the chief organizer Gary Heinrich and the participants in last Friday’s Swimathon, which has raised about $300.  Thanks also to staff who have put in the extra work for organizing individual study programs as an experiment in the last fortnight.

Religious instruction has continued for two groups this year: Anglicans with Rev. Stephenson and Roman Catholics with two Sisters from Georgetown.  Last year we were shocked by the sudden death of the school cleaner Mr Hawkins on the day after speech night.  He had been a cleaner at the High School from 1958 and for both school for some years before that.  Mrs Bagg said she could not continue alone and so another cleaner was found.  Mr Brak has done a very efficient job.  The Burra Record is thanked for printing news concerning the school and Mrs Carpenter & Mrs Cockington for continuing the singing tradition at the school.

Characteristics of the 1971 paper.

A fair coverage of local issues along with a number of general interest articles.  There are very few photographs of local events and generally they appear well after the occasion.

The Burra Mine and associated activities like saving the old mine buildings get good coverage and sport, as usual, is quite well covered, but it is disappointing to find a number of other things are only referred to in the briefest terms in the ‘Out and About’ column.

Obituaries with any significant detail are rare and editorial comment on the changes occurring in the town is completely lacking.  Much of the news comes from beyond the town and immediate district and there is a lot of space devoted to articles of a generic nature; such as advice to primary producers.  Questions in Parliament are another significant input; usually with a clear right wing bias, which is unsurprising given the electorate.

Rather than print supplements the practice this year was to print in the gutters, which poses a problem for any binding of the paper’s archived copies.

Overall the decline in quality and local relevance noted in the last few years is continued.

There is no hard and fast location for most items, but the following gives an idea of where they commonly appear.

Page 1 is devoted to news.

Page 2 is half news and half advertisements.

Page 3 is similar to page 2.

Page 4 is mostly advertisements and the ‘50 years Ago’ column.

Page 5 is mostly advertising and sport.

Page 6 carries the ‘Out and About’ column, which is at once valuable and informative and annoyingly brief on some matters.  The ‘Cash Column’ of small advertisements is usually here and the rest of the space is given over to public notices and advertisements.

Pages 7 & 8 are split fairly evenly between advertisements and news, along with items of general interest.

In the football season the equivalent of a full page of results is scattered about, but even so they are often incomplete.

Burra Mine

Heavy machinery used by Roche Bros has disclosed the main access tunnel from the ore body to the outside from the pre-1870 operations.  The tunnel would be approximately 600 ft in length from the ‘fall in’ to the top and several hundred feet back to the lower levels of the open cut.  About 400 ft along the tunnel there is a turntable of approximately 4 ft 6 inches diameter in perfect working order.  Beyond there is a section of rail track and a set of points.  The very solid timbering of the tunnel is in good condition with some nails not even rusty.  Mine workers had been into the tunnel prior to the visit.  The writer was accompanied by Mr Lewis Moore who photographed the turntable.  The foul air in the tunnel did not permit a long stay.  A series of pulleys along the roof of the tunnel (as seen on either side of the turntable) are still positioned and these were used to draw the rail trucks and loads of ore from the lower workings.  The positioning of the pulleys etc. would suggest that while a loaded truck was being hauled up, the weight of an empty truck going down was used to help the upward pull.  The access tunnel would have been in use long before the open cut method of mining was adopted and a considerable portion of it would have been destroyed on the lower end.  Apparently an unsealed entrance on the top side existed some time ago and persons had been into the tunnel.  Several names were written on the underside of the underside of the turntable.  One was Rex Walker Bridge St Sunday 17/8/1930.

[There are photographs; one of the turntable suspended from the overhead timbers and showing the solid timbering of the tunnel.  Another is a close-up of the turntable with the spliced rope attached, on which the steel worked.  Animal fats were used for lubrication and are still evident around the central spindle.  There is another on page 7.]

In the modern mine the production of copper oxide has reached its planned level for stage 1.  Local and interstate markets have been obtained in the fertilizer field and overseas negotiations continue.  Planning for stage two continues and this should be operational within 12-18 months, boosting treatment to 1,000 tons per day.

Ian Auhl writes to draw people’s attention to the recently published book, The Steel Master.  It is the biography of Essington Lewis who was born in Burra in 1881 and became General Manager of BHP and Director General of Munitions and Aircraft Production during WWII.  One photo in the book shows the Lewis home in Kangaroo Street after the snowstorm of 1901.  The book mentions at some length the years when John Lewis lived in Burra as a partner in the firm Liston, Shakes & Lewis (later Bagot, Shakes & Lewis).  Essington attended the Burra Primary School.  The author is Geoffrey Blainey.

Steelton Post Office finally closed on 29 January 1972 after over 100 years of service.  It is thought the office opened in the 1860s or earlier when Steelton was established as a result of the discovery of copper at Burra.  Steelton was on the copper route to Kapunda via Black Springs and Marrabel.  Steelton then had a blacksmith’s shop, a hotel and other buildings.  A school was set up and the first school teacher was Mr Henry Parkins who became the first postmaster.  The early mail service came from Saddleworth.  Names of early mail contractors are not known, but in the motor car era some have been: Harry Butler, Mr Becker, Norm Tank, Edgar & Harold Milde, Bert Milgate and the present one is Ivan Milde.  The first post office was on the main road and existed for nearly 100 years.  Henry Parkin passed the office to his sister and soon afterwards she passed it to Harry Parkin, clerk of the Waterloo Council and later overseer of the Saddleworth Council.  He carried it on until about 15 years ago, when it was taken over by Mr & Mrs Vern Schmaal, who held it till its closure.  About 12 years ago the old building was in a bad state of repair and the site was changed to the present one, some 500 yards north on the property of Mr Ben Schmaal.  Locals gathered on Saturday morning to see the arrival of the last mail bag to Steelton.  Residents will now be served by a road-side delivery service or private boxes from Saddleworth.

[Opened 1 September 1861 according to Matin Walker The Post, Telegraph & Telephone Offices of SA & NT (2004).]

Burra High School

Plans for a replacement High School were referred to the Public Works Standing Committee last Thursday.  The plans were to replace the High School buildings completely on a new 20 acre site about half a mile from the present site.  The present school is in inadequate buildings on a small site shared with the Primary School, the Minister for Education, Hugh Hudson, said.  The new school is planned to be built around a square courtyard with versatile open space, specialist teaching areas and science labs and a library resource centre.  There will be provisions for Home science, Needlework, Woodwork, Metalwork and Typing, along with administration, a shelter/activity area and a canteen shell.  The new school is designed for up to 200 students.  The transfer would allow the whole of the existing school for use by the Primary School, enabling substantial improvements.

Accident.  A semi-trailer overturned at Hanson on Thursday at 9 p.m.  It was loaded with empty bottles.  The driver was not seriously injured.

Burra Saleyards

Elders-GM conducted their monthly market in the ‘Bon Accord’ Saleyards today and this was the final sale prior to their demolition.  They will be replaced by yards of steel construction.  Today’s yarding was of 6,300 sheep.  The first market was on Friday 25 November 1887 with a yarding of 25,000 sheep and 300 cattle for Elders Wool & Produce Co.

[The paper of 22 February 1972 says the first Elder’s sale was on 27 July 1888 with 4,350 sheep and 15 cattle.  This anomaly may be because of the change of name from Elder’s Wool & Produce Co. to Elder, Smith & Co. Ltd.]

These yards were reconstructed and opened with a sale on 15 October 1891 with a yarding of 25,174 sheep.  Messrs Sara & Dunstan were the contractors.  With several stock agents in the town, a combined total of 40,000 sheep a month was common.  Elders were then yarding over 200,000 sheep a year with Shakes & Lewis handling a similar number and Morris, Sandland & Barritt 170,000 to 200,000, plus some from other agents.  Over half a million sheep were handled annually until a series of bad seasons from 1892 saw a drop of more than 50%.  As other country markets grew the numbers at Burra fell.  The peak sale for SA was on 27 September 1895 when Elders at Burra yarded 44,000 sheep and sold 36,000 of them with 750 head of cattle.

Burra Anglican Parish Old Style Country Fair was held at the Burra Showgrounds last Saturday.  The crowd of about 700 was well entertained and buying at the stalls was brisk.  The gross takings of about $1,150 should see a nett return of about $900.  The merry-go-round built by Thamm’s Whitehart Garage was a non-stop success, with children queuing all afternoon.  Horse rides were popular and so was the Children’s Fancy Dress Competition, which gave the judges, Rev. & Mrs Hore of Burra Uniting Church, a difficult task.  Visitors from Adelaide were offered a three hour town tour with the Mine included and a surprising number of Burra people patronised this option too.  The motor cycle skills of the Denton Bros of Farrell Flat delighted the boys and girls.

Burra National Trust Branch held its AGM recently.

President W.L. More gave a résumé of its activities.  An Australia-wide appeal was made for funds to rebuild Peacock’s Chimney.  The complex of buildings at Peacock’s Shaft was demolished by Samin Ltd.  After discussion Samin agreed to bypass the complex to give time to remove the stack.  To date $8002.36 has been received.  Bad weather slowed the rebuilding, but it is now to the stage of the top brickwork.  Much volunteer labour has kept the cost so far to $3,688.47.  Thanks are due to all the donors and especially to Ian Auhl for setting up the appeal and to Messrs G. O’Connor, D. Cockington and M. Tiver for so much of their time.  On 29 September the Thomas Pickett plaque was unveiled.  Mr Bonython as State President of the National Trust gave an address.  Mr Ian Auhl recounted the story of Thomas Pickett and Mr Stan Woollacott dedicated the memorial.  The stone used is part of one of the counter-balances from the old Mine.  The Waterworks officially handed over the Bon Accord engineer’s shop and the manager’s cottage to the National Trust on condition that Mrs Fisher be allowed the use of the cottage as long as she requires it.  The roster system at the Museum has worked well.  The increasing number of coaches and school visits to the town is placing an increasing demand on volunteer guides. Mr Woollacott estimates 7,000 visitors to the Museum.  [Various other people are then thanked.]

Elected: President, W.L. Moore; Vice-Presidents, G.R. O’Connor & L. Warnes; Secretary, M.A. Tiver; Treasurer, D. Cockington; Curator, S. Woollacott and Historical Officer, I.L. Auhl.

Burra Copper Festival

The Governor Sir Mark Oliphant will visit Burra during the Copper Festival 7-9 October.   He will unveil a plaque on the resited Peacock’s Chimney Stack on Sunday 8 October.  The Committee is considering many suggestions put forward for the festival.  Mr Michael Trinnick of the [British] National Trust’s Committee for Devon and Cornwall has sent £10 sterling for the building fund appeal and says that in Cornwall they have preserved four Cornish engines in their original houses and hope to get one moving by steam.  There is a fifth one in Holman’s Museum in Cambourne.  The National Trust owns several ruined engine houses as well.  These have been repaired and made safe for the foreseeable future and work on another will begin soon at Wheal Coates in the Parish of St Agnes, north of Truro in Cornwall.

Subscriptions will be sought for another week, after which, if sufficient funds are not available, directors will be forced to refund subscriptions.  An earlier canvass of the district suggested ample funds were available, but little of the promised money has been subscribed.

The Burra Strike of 1848 [By Ian Auhl?]

News of the strike reached Adelaide 15 September 1848 with a request that twenty policemen be rushed up country because the mines had been occupied by 300 incensed miners, who were refusing to move even one ton of ore.  The trouble started when the Sa Mining Association decided to sack Mr Thomas Burr, Superintendent of the Mines.  When Burr refused to resign the Directors went to Burra and he was relieved of his duties.  He left for Adelaide.  The miners then complained of a grievance concerning the analysis of the ore samples.  The system used three samples taken from each miner’s ore when it was cleaned and dressed.  The first was taken by the miner, the second by the Superintendent and the third was sent to the Directors in Adelaide.  The assay made in Burra was agreed to by both parties, but the Adelaide tests were frequently at variance.  The miners thought they were being underpaid and the Directors thought the miners were seeking high rates for low grade ores.  The Directors refused to talk and threatened to close the mine.  There was a large quantity of ore on hand, which had to be assayed before the miners could be paid and the miners took control of the mines to prevent the ore being shifted.  Only eight of 300 miners tried to work and two of them were tied back to back and paraded through the streets on a wheelbarrow – the other standouts were compelled to push the barrow.  The Directors called on the solitary policeman to arrest the ring-leaders, but he had no chance.  The news caused Burra Mine Shared to slump from £220 to £120 for a £5 share.  Police Commissioner Dashwood and Inspector Tolmer headed to the Mines and several miners were fined for threatening language.

A conference was then held and it was decided that when the difference between the assays at the mine and those in Adelaide was greater than 30% the results would be averaged.  On the way home when Mr Chambers was driving the horses, he lost control.  Commissioner Dashwood made a grab for the reins and the horses swerved violently, turning the carriage over.  Later Thomas Burra sued for wrongful dismissal and obtained £1,500.

Obituary.  A Notice to Creditors reveals the death of Henry Rex Dasborough, farmer and grazier of WA, on 28 June 1971. [He was born 12 July 1905 Findon and on 30 May 1936 married Lurline Nelly Tiver born 8 September 1911 at Redruth to George Samuel Tiver and Ellen Tiver nee Kelly.  This connects him to the descendants of James Llewellyn Tiver (1829-1909) in the Burra District.]

Burra High School.  The proposed site for the new High School was inspected by Mr E.C. Allen MP and the Public Works Standing Committee [members of which are listed].  It is expected tenders will be called later this year for work commencing in 1973, for occupancy in 1974.  The brick building is square in design with about 100 feet square of lawn and shrubs at the centre.  There will be tennis courts, a hockey field and oval and two footbridges and one vehicle bridge over the creek.  The party also visited the Mine area.

[The site proposed at the time was not spelled out, but subsequent discussion suggests it was on the western side of the bypass road a little south of the railway station – between the bypass road and Copperhouse.]

Burra RSL.  President B. Kotz, Annual Report for 1971

There has been a lack of support from some of the elected committee members.  In nine monthly meetings one committeeman did not attend at all and another only once.  The Anzac Day and Armistice Day services were held as usual.  The annual dinner was a success and so were the badge days conducted by the Ladies’ Auxiliary, who also ran a successful trading table for Legacy.  Mr Ron Wuttke, who had been a solid supporter, was given a public farewell.  Three members died during the year: H. Brown, R. Kellock and R. Motherall.

Burra Show Society held its AGM on Tuesday night.  The balance sheet showed a credit balance of $238.78.  Elected: Patron, Rex C. Warnes; President, R. Mason; Vice-Presidents, G. Kellock & M.G. Wardle.

Mrs Val Secomb has resigned as secretary and applications are being sought.  The retiring President R. Mason reported on a successful 1971 show, opened by His Excellency Shizuo Saito, Ambassador of Japan.  The morning was cold and overcast, but the afternoon remained fine.  Overall entries were up on 1970 by 239.  Sheep shearing was a highlight, though entries were down.  Miss Show Girl was a popular contest.  This year jumps and hurdles were improved and 250 new poultry cages were available.  Working bees had been well attended.  Horses in Action entries were down slightly.  Wool entries increased considerably.  Sheep numbers were down, but of a high standard.  The Agricultural Pavilion was filled to capacity.  The Schools’ Display was excellent.  Industrial exhibits made a bright display.  The Honda Agricultural Motor Cycle Trials were very popular.  Many other sections had increased numbers of entries.  [Thanks are then extended to many helpers.]

Burra Mine

Poseidon has announced it is going into the copper chemical field using Samin’s product, copper oxide.  The Burra venture was acquired late in 1970 when Poseidon successfully bid for Samin Ltd.  The copper chemical venture with Vermont Chemical & Seed Pty Ltd of Melbourne (largely owned by protein and fertilizer makers H.C. Pannifex & Co. Ltd) aims to make a range of chemicals for use in primary and secondary industry throughout Australia.  The initial product, copper oxychloride, is used for spray cropping [crop spraying?].  The local market is approximately 500 tons p.a.  Poseidon is about to begin stage 2 of the Burra project, which should lift production of copper oxide five fold to about 6,500 tons per year, worth $6-$7 million.  This expansion of the works at Burra is expected to be completed next year.  The market in Australia for cupric oxide has turned out to be larger than expected.  [Photo of Burra leach tanks.]

[The Chairman reported on sports activities and fundraising for the past year.]

The triangular area directly in front of the school has been unsightly for many years.  In 1971 the area was ploughed, levelled and treated with gypsum and sown to lawn.  Thanks go especially to Murray Tiver for dealing with the ploughing and working and to others who were involved.  The water supply to the school was improved with much increased water pressure and an efficiently functioning fire hydrant after many years.  The new classroom was completed in mid-1971 and has been an important addition to the school.  The Department has approved the enlargement of the area at the back of the tennis court.  The walkway to Burra North is now an easement and work on it should begin soon.  We welcome three new teachers for 1972 in Miss Lester, Miss Williams and Mr Good.

Farrell Flat Overpass.  Mr Allen MP asked in Parliament why the proposed overpass at the railway crossing just north of Farrell Flat had been abandoned.  Hon. G.T. Virgo replied that the $150,000 cost was not deemed justified.  Only 150 vehicles a day use the crossing, so undue delays are not expected.  A new crossing will be constructed with flashing lights just north of the present crossing.

John M. Gordon writes about the Burra Motel proposal from ‘Wahroonga’, 7 April.

I would like to draw the attention of Burra residents to the necessity of completing the Burra Motel project.  The project is within striking distance of raising the finance.  The town would greatly benefit from the increased tourism.  SA is just beginning to see progress in this type of accommodation, which is booming in the eastern states.  Tourism has been growing as we know from the caravan park.  This venture using local finance will keep the returns in the district.

M & BHA held a lunch at the Burra town Hall on 6 April, but it was not well attended, probably because it clashed with the Burra High School Sports Day.

Burra District Sports Grounds

This property was recently handed over to the Burra Burra DC by the Burra Sports Syndicate and with some other land purchased by the Council provided grounds for the Aberdeen Football Club, Aberdeen Netball Club and the Burra Golf Club.  The Burra Racing Club has closed at least for the time being and the racing stalls and running rails have been removed.  This has made extra space available.  The area under the trees along the creek would make an ideal picnic spot if developed with tables, seats and barbecues.  Social bodies could hire the oval.  The grass courts could be restored to playing condition and could be available for Sunday play.  If these ideas appeal to anyone, now is the time to act.

Obituary.  Mr Matthew Francis Carmody died on Sunday morning at his Leighton home when he was crushed between the tip-tray and the chassis of a truck.  The raised tray had been propped with heavy timber and he was greasing the rear under section of the vehicle when the timber slipped sideways and there had been a sufficient loss of hydraulic pressure for the tray to descend.  Two nephews and his son Patrick discovered the accident at approximately 12.45 p.m.  He is survived by his widow and children: Patrick, Mary, Michael and Helen.

Burra Mine

A recent state-wide weekly publication stated ‘Burra seems destined to become nothing more than a big hole in the ground, and a ghastly mess after mining has ended.’

Residents have expressed displeasure at the heading and opening of the article, which was otherwise a well meant attempt at stressing the importance of preserving Burra and its historical buildings.  The mine is far from a mess because of the rigid mining regulations and the efficient manner in which Samin Ltd are carrying out operations.

[Six requirements to limit the impact are then listed.]

The District Council were aware of the conditions before mining commenced and the company provides a healthy pay packet each week, which should be spent in the town.  Current operations are practically confined to the old mine area, which for the past 100 years has been a ‘big hole in the ground containing water’.  The operations will remain inside the boundary fence and will not interfere with the town.

Mr Steele Hall, Liberal Movement Leader, addressed a gathering in Burra on Wednesday evening.  He spoke of the urgent need for change within the LCL.  The League had failed to attract the metropolitan voters.  It has allowed an image to be formed that it is a party of privilege and of the Establishment, with no belief in the common man.  The Liberal Movement aims to break this image.  He had resigned as leader of the LCL because the party was not willing to embrace the change needed to win city seats.

The New Elders-GM Stockyards were opened on Tuesday by Chairman of the Burra Burra DC Mr Roy Jeffery.  Until 1967 Mr Jeffery had been manager of Southern Farmers at Burra for many years.  He said from 1887 for many years the prices of Burra Livestock Markets ruled SA.  The Bon Accord yards at Burra North were the scene of Elders first country market.  He traced the story of sales by Elders at Kooringa and by Shakes & Lewis; Morris; Morris, Sandland & Barritt; and Goodchild, Duff & Co. in yards at the Burra Hotel and behind Paxton Square.  Agents had sold 40,000 sheep a month or 200,000 a year.  In 1888 there was a yarding of 39,060 sheep on the site of the present yards.  The record yarding was for 44,000 sheep and 750 cattle in 1895.  For the new yards Southern Farmers had combined with Elders with an offering of 2,000 sheep and 200 cattle.  Elders-GM offered 5,140 sheep and sold 4,810.

Burra Burra DC will celebrate its centenary to coincide with the Copper Festival.  The District Council was proclaimed 28 November 1872.  The Town Council did not appear until June 1876.  The first meeting of the DC was in S. Drew & Co.’s office on 9 December 1872.  Cr Isaac Killicoat was appointed Chairman.  Other Councillors were H. Dawson, S. Drew, J. Dunstan & D. McCulloch.  J. Dunstan Jun. was appointed Clerk pro tem.  Meetings were held on alternate Thursday s at 10 a.m. with the second meeting in the old Burra Hotel.  On 26 December 1872 J.D. Cave was appointed District Clerk and Collector at $150 p.a.  Messrs Cave & Goodfellow were appointed assessors at $40 each.  On 10 March 1973 Mr Tiver’s offer of two rooms at $48 p.a. was accepted for one month as the DC office.  On 6 February 1873 it was decided to call tenders for an office in suitable premises in Aberdeen, Redruth or Kooringa.  On 30 September 1873 the Secretary of the Institute advised that the Council could use the Institute for meetings at $40 p.a. provided the agreement was for one year.  It was resolved that the offer be accepted provided a new room was built for the clerk’s office by the end of three months.  The clerk was instructed to move furniture, safe etc to the office 23 December 1873 and Council evident met there from that date to the present time.  [This last statement is not correct.]

[The following clearly reprinted an item written in 1935.]

In 1935 the Councillors were as follows:

N.H. Hearse [sic: error for Pearse], elected July 1914, appointed Chairman 1 July 1921 & served as such to the final meeting* – a period of 21 years.

J. Kellock elected 10 June 1916 – 19 years

R. Warnes elected 12 June 1920 – 15 years

E. Finch elected 29 October 1921 – 14 years

H.W. Tiver elected 4 July 1924 – 11 years

W.H. McWaters elected 4 July 1925 – 10 years

G.G. Hawkes elected 15 July 1927 – 8 years

[* This apparent anomaly in referring to a last meeting in 1935 for an institution having its centenary in 1972 occurs because from 1872 to 1935 there was a District Council of Burra.  In 1935 the District Council of Burra Burra was formed by the merger of the DCs of Burra, Hanson, Booborowie & Mt Bryan.]

A.A. Davey was appointed Clerk 9 July 1910 and held the position for 25 years.  J.J. Parker was appointed Overseer 10 June 1921 and held it to the present – 14 years.

The final meeting of the Booborowie DC was held 29 April 1935.  Offers to buy the Council furniture were refused as too low.  The chair of the Council was presented to the Booborowie Hall Committee.  The Council recorded a minute that it strongly disapproved of the amalgamation of the district and was not satisfied with the findings of the commission, as the Council was large enough to function on its own.  It was resolved that the Clerk be supplied with a reference.  The Council would have been 60 years old on 5 May.

The final meeting of the Burra DC was on 26 April 1935.  With the merging of Councils the new body comprised: I.J. Warnes as Chairman with Councillors H.C. Atkins, J. Kellock, A.D. McDonald, E. Finch, H.E. Edwards, F.G. Scholz and T.J. Wedding, with G. Powell as Clerk and Overseer.

Aberdeen Oval has recently been improved.  More parking space with a good view has been made available, but now some people at the end of the match are driving across the oval instead of using the tracks provided.  On a wet day this could spoil the surface for the rest of the season.  The cost of erecting fencing would be an unnecessary expense.

Burra Burra DC will borrow $10,000 at 6.2% as a debenture loan over 10 years, to finance the new toilets and office additions, which will include a fire-proof strong room, a storage room and an office machinery room.  The public conveniences will open onto Chapel Street.

The Highways Department is acquiring land at Farrell Flat to remove the sharp bend at the end of the Farrell Flat by-pass.

The rebuilding of Peacock’s Chimney.

[Photo of Burra Mine from the hill above the round chimney looking north past the round crusher chimney to the silos and beyond.]

In the early stages it was plain sailing.  The chimney was quickly dismantled and moved to the new site at the Mine entrance.  The courses were laid out and re-erection went smoothly as each course had been marked.

Difficulties began when the brick section was reached.  The old bricks proved unsuitable, having weathered too much in 100 years and other second-hand bricks had to be found.  The wet and windy weather intervened and then new bricklayers had to be found.  The original bricklayers found they could not build a tapered chimney and various others tried.  Finally two finished the job, but they had almost performed the impossible by squaring the circle.  Though it did not look too bad from a distance, it was decided it was unacceptable and unfair both on the subscribers and the memory of the old Cornish masons.  It was taken down.  After a long search Mr Colin Barron of Barron & Sons offered to complete it, but a week later, due to illness in the family, he had to withdraw.

Mr Bob O’Neill of O’ Neill & Clayton Ltd came to the rescue – recommended by Adelaide architect Mr Steve Gilbert.  Mr O’ Neill was President of the Master Builders’ Association for some years and a foundation member of the National Trust.  He had specialised in the reconstruction of historic buildings, including the restoration of Charles Sturt’s cottage at the Grange.

Cornish masons were in the habit of building their chimney stacks from the scaffolding inside the chimney and this was the method that had been followed on the first attempt at rebuilding Peacock’s Chimney.  Lack of experience resulted in failure, particularly at the top where the brickwork is stepped out (corbelling).

Mr O’Neill decided to use scaffolding on the outside.  This is more expensive, but use of volunteers has helped to contain costs.  The cost of hiring and erecting the scaffolding without volunteer labour would have been $950.  This cost has been halved.  Now the work has been re-commenced and the Governor will open the completed chimney at the Copper Festival.

Burra Burra DC has adopted a new assessment.  The valuation of 1971 is $5,923,370; a drop from $7,328,700.  The previous rate of 0.9c in the dollar will have to rise to 1.1c in the dollar to maintain the income of $65, 958.  The new rate will be discussed at Monday’s Council meeting.

Due to a strike of refinery maintenance workers the Local Government Department stopped Council plants from operating.

Local Government in Burra.  Researched by Ian Auhl.

From an article in the Register 11 May 1872.

A pleasing sign of improvement in Kooringa is that the Burra Mining Co. is beginning to repair its numerous cottages, and make little additions to roads and footpaths.  The town has been in their hands for more than twenty years and signs of the amount spent on it by the landlords, who are supposed to have drawn rent from every house until recently, are few and far between.  The tenants have been equally indifferent to appearances and as a result Kooringa has been shabby and many of its houses, if such they can be called, are among the most squalid in the British Empire.

In the main street one sees business places paintless and with stucco off their fronts, a stable roof held on by stones to prevent it blowing away, signboards unreadable owing to the latest coat sweating off and old lettering showing through.  A blacksmith’s wooden shop that has not stood upright in the last ten years and the words ‘Letterbox’ visible on a house that was used as a Post Office 22 years ago.  With all this, a stranger is surprised to learn the tradesmen are well to do.  There are a few exceptions and of late considerable improvement has taken place in a few instances.  One large drapery firm has put in new windows and repainted its front.  Other houses of business have undergone a little repair and last week the Mining Co. began covering their row of cottages in Market Square with iron and renovating the police cottage walls.

With this and Mr Banks’ new assembly room and his public house undergoing outside improvements the square would present a decent improvement if the ginger beer factory had a new face.  But a stroll among houses at the back of the commercial quarter has a depressing effect.  Ruins present themselves everywhere.  There are cottages without doors and windows and the roofs are often dilapidated.  Company houses have daubed and dirty walls and paint is either unknown or ancient.  The Wesleyan Mission House and Chapel are surrounded by a substantial stone wall.  St Mary’s Church has recently been thoroughly repainted inside and out, as has the Bible Christian Chapel and a few residences of the tradesmen, but in other directions all is in desolation.

The company has begun removing a few old walls and filling in the little creeks on the roadways with old mortar and plaster and is making a kind of road from the paddock towards the cemetery.  It is to be hoped more refurbishment will go on and that Kooringa, on entering upon a new career of prosperity, will ‘be relieved from the disgrace of being styled, as it has been, the shabbiest town in the Australias.’

From an article in the Register 2 July 1872.

The District Council movement has died again.

The first agitators, disgusted with the conduct of some others, have stopped their efforts.

This is to be lamented because local government would greatly improve the town.  Goats and pigs roam at ease in the streets, much to the annoyance of people who have formed gardens.  The roads are miserable.

From an article in the Register 26 August 1872.

A meeting has been held at Banks’ Assembly Rooms in Kooringa to consider the desirability of forming a District Council.  Perhaps in no part of South Australia are the roads outside an important town in such a deplorable state as these.  Before the land became settled and fenced, traffic could generally be carried on by travellers striking out on fresh tracks when the old ones became too cut up.  Now fences preclude such a course and a Council for the repair of highways is imperative.

Captain Killicoat JP presided over a meeting of about 30 people.  Mr A. King advocated a District Council extending north to the southern half of the Hundred of Kingston and south to the Hundred of Apoinga; an area of some 80,000 acres.  Mr J.R. Stephens proposed a Council be formed of such an area.

Mr Ridgway thought this included too much useless country and wanted the Council confined to the township.

Mr O. Harvey was in favour of the original proposition.

Mr J.R. Stephens thought the area would have to be divided into wards.

Mr Moody was glad to see such energy and action and sought to nominate Councillors and Auditors.

The district was divided into North, South, Redruth and Kooringa Wards with five Councillors; one in each of the first three wards named and two in the last.  Chosen as Councillors were:

North Ward	Mr J. Dunstan Sen.

South Ward	Mr McCullock [sic] JP

Redruth Ward	Captain Killicoat JP

Kooringa Ward	Mr J. Drew JP

Mr H. Dawson

Auditors	Messrs G.V. Goodhart JP and W.H. Rosman

Note by Ian Auhl:

It has been stated that the population of Burra in 1850 was 20,000.  This is incorrect.  The combined population of Redruth, Aberdeen and Kooringa was a little over 4,500 and 1003 men and boys were employed at the Burra Mine.  By 1861 the population of the three towns was 4,347.  The SA Mining Association then employed 1,208 men and the population of the County of Burra was 5,483 with 15,856 acres under cultivation.  By 1871 the population of the three towns had fallen to 3,401 and the cultivated area had increased to 65, 215 acres.

Johnny Green: research by Ian Auhl

Johnny Green, the silent miner and mascot of the old Burra Burra Miners, has risen again – this time to the top of the resited Peacock’s Chimney.  Once again he is holding aloft his pick and gad at the mine entrance.  Johnny has been around the mine for more than 120 years.  Early paintings and photographs show he has always been the same, holding aloft his emblems on some high point of a mine building.  But he has moved around and his bodywork has changed.  The first Johnny Green was made of wood, as a hastily constructed mascot erected on the top of the wooden shears on Roach’s Pump House on the day it was completed in 1848 and it was still there in 1855 when he was seen by a reporter from the Observer in March.  He was said then to be in his old place, though the engine had been removed.

The second Johnny Green was made of iron and is still in existence, its limbs now riveted together since New Year Vandals tumbled it from its pole at the mine entrance a few years ago.  He is having a well-earned rest in the jinker shed.  When Schneider’s Engine House was completed in 1852 to house the new engine imported from Cornwall, Johnny was placed on the winding wheel platform over the shaft and an 1857 painting by [William] Bentley shows him there.  On approaching the Mine, wrote a visitor, the first object that strikes the eye is Schneider’s Engine House.  The engine works at seven strokes a minute, each time raising 136 gallons of water.  The completion of an engine house and chimney stack generally called for celebrations.  Masons and miners sometimes celebrated completion by drinking a barrel of ale on top.  (The author of this article had to settle for a stubby of beer when he went ‘up top’ on Saturday.)

With the starting of the engine came the christening of the building with brass band, speeches and champagne.  Johnny Green was there in 1852 to watch over the ‘christening’ of Schneider’s Pump House.  The Directors came from Adelaide.  Henry Ayers, Secretary of the SA Mining Association, threw a bottle of champagne at the beam and the Directors followed suit.

In 1858 when Morphett’s Engine House was completed the miners shifted their mascot to the poppet-head platform and it stayed there for the next 67 years, presiding over the death of the Mine in 1877.

During the Back to Burra week in 1925 an old miner, John Beale, returned for another look at Johnny Green.  He had been the ‘roper’ and for many years had stood by the iron figure of the miner on the high platform of Morphett’s Shaft.

In 1929 Frank Treloar in his 77th year published his reminiscences of the Mine in the Burra Record and wrote of Johnny Green, that he had stood silently on top of the pump house until a fire a few years ago caused his downfall.  He was carefully preserved and Mr Treloar was pleased then he learned Councillors intended to have the figure re-erected in a suitable position.  Neither Frank Treloar nor anyone else tells us if there was ever a real ‘Johnny Green’ among the miners.

[The report of the fire from the Burra Record in December 1925 is then reprinted.  The fire referred to occurred on Saturday morning 5 December 1925.]

At about 11 a.m. smoke was seen coming from the top storey of the small engine house close to Morphett’s Shaft and later grass nearby was also noticed alight.  Residents in the area beat out the grass fire, but not realising how serious the fire was, they failed to raise the alarm and tried to put it out themselves.  Between 2 and 3 p.m. it has assumed such proportions that fighting it was out of the question and soon the fire spread to the big engine house over Morphett’s Shaft.  The woodwork of immense proportions burnt like matches.  Towards midnight quite a crowd collected to see the blazing poppets fall, which supported the platform on which the big pulley wheel was fixed, used when the mine was working, for drawing ore up the shaft.  On this also stood the life-sized figure of a miner holding a round stone hammer and chisel.  This figure had always been revered by the miners and even the present generation felt regrets when it, in company with the wheel, crashed to the ground.  The wheel, five feet in diameter and at white heat, broke, but the figure was not badly damaged.  Morphett’s Shaft is heavily timbered and is now burning fiercely.  On Saturday night the sight was very beautiful with flames leaping to a great height.  On Sunday hundreds gathered to see the large columns of smoke ascending from Morphett’s Shaft and the beam timber could be heard falling away and crashing into the water below.

The property belongs to Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride of Adelaide.

Police are investigating, but it is generally alleged the fire was caused by some lads smoking out pigeons, of which a large number live in these buildings.  Many old miners say it could be weeks before the fire burns itself out.

The following week the paper apologised for saying the figure carried a hammer and chisel.  It was in fact a pick and miner’s gad.  The head had a miner’s hat and place for a candle in front.

At the December meeting of the Town Council it was decided to approach Messrs A.J. & P.A. McBride Ltd and request them to present to the town the effigy of the miner brought to the ground in the recent fire.

Johnny eventually found himself on top of a pole at the mine entrance, where he remained until vandals cut him down in 1967.  The second Johnny Green was too broken to be given another lease of life and was pensioned off to the jinker enclosure while his ‘ghost’ still hovers above.  It is appropriate that the new Johnny Green was fashioned and presented to the Burra National Trust by the new mine owners Samin Ltd.

[See the report of the fire XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3.  The report in the paper seems to indicate that the fire occurred on 12 December, but the boys who started it appeared in court on 10 December, which would seem to make the date of the fire Saturday 5 December rather than Saturday 12 December.  In XXXXVII, 49, 16 Dec. 1925, page 3 the court case is also reported.  This reveals that the boys were attempting to smoke out rabbits (not pigeons) from under the floor of the engine house near Morphett’s Engine House.]

Burra Burra Hospital Inc. held its AGM last Thursday night.  The Board remains unchanged.  Chairman R.K. Pearse’s report: the 95th Annual Report.

Financial.  With a surplus of $21,582-90 our credit balance stands at $48,266 plus $25,000 invested.  The only major increase in costs has been $8,909 in wages.  There are now 15 full-time nursing staff and 4 part-time.  The daily average cost per patient rose by $2.26 to $14.08 and the daily average of patients was 19.8.  50 babies were born at the hospital.

Improvements’   It had been hoped that improvements forecast last year would be a reality.  Plans and specifications have been approved and tenders called.  Estimates were submitted to the Hospitals Department and we await their approval.  The estimated cost of the project is $240,000.    We will be able to finance this from hospital finances and will not have a public appeal.  The only major improvements this year have been the enclosing of the ambulance entrance and replacing twenty-one beds and mattresses for $3,100.  Finance permitting we will paint the exterior this year.  The remaining rooms of the Nurses Quarters have been re-painted and new curtains hung.

Cropping Program.  No Cropping was undertaken this year due to the late season.

Ladies’ Auxiliary.  This continues to give valuable assistance with keeping the hospital linen in order and by provision of jams and preserves.

Burra & District Fund Raising Committee.  This year a cheque for $1,020 was donated.  The new building will require $16,000 worth of new equipment so any money raised will be used in that direction.

Staff.  Matron Fyfe and the Secretary-Manager Mr L. Packer have continued their excellent service.  Matron has been ably assisted by Sisters Byles, Ward, Wright, Brown, McDonald, Moller, Lucas & Carmody during the year and by Sisters Parker and Broad on staff at present as well as a very willing bans of nurses.  Sister Good has ably filled the role of Tutor Sister.  The domestic staff and handy-man have carried out their duties diligently.

Meals on Wheels is proving to be one of the most worthwhile operations commenced in the district for some time.

[Various other people and Board members are then thanked.]

I regret the passing of Mr Matt Carmody, a Board Member for eleven years, and welcome Mr Harry Rich to the Board.

Burra Growth.  Apart from the initial program of Samin Ltd there has been other growth in the past two years and at present more is taking place.  The second stage of Samin’s mining operations is under way and this will quadruple production.  Construction of Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes has started at a cost of $102,000.  Additions and redevelopment at the hospital will give a new maternity section, kitchen and more private and shared rooms at a cost of $240,000.  Private and business works underway or just completed are worth c. $30,000.

Hotels in the town, through the addition of new toilets and other improvements have spent in excess of $25,000.  New stock saleyards have been erected and building of private homes has amounted to over $40,000.  In the 1970-71 period there was the housing project worth over $120,000 and the new Police Station was valued at $30,000.  The town is fast becoming known for its unique historic attractions and tourism is growing.

Burra Retail Traders’ Association responds to ‘Irate School Leaver’.

One reason for employing married women is given in Irate’s own letter: she wants experience before going on to Adelaide.  It costs money to train employees, who frequently leave before they are of value to an employer.  Most local businessmen who employ a percentage of married women do so where a senior is needed to train juniors, or to ensure continuity of employment, or where the married woman joined their staff whilst single.  Many local people do not support local business and this does not allow them to grow and employ more staff.  The town and district is only as strong as the support it gets.  Burra is on the threshold of a great future due to tourism and mining.  Unfortunately there are a few in the district who cannot see the advantages of tourism to the whole district, namely that it brings in many people who demand better shops, cafés, hotels, roads, parks and sporting facilities etc. that are also then enjoyed by locals.  It creates more jobs for more people and has a snowballing effect.  The businessmen of Burra sympathise with school leavers who desire employment here, but hope they will not become ‘knockers’ of the town and district.

D.T. Wedding writes in support of the Booborowie Branch of the United Farmers & Graziers’ Association’s call for the Burra Burra DC to reconsider the rate of 1.4c in the dollar, in favour of a return to an income level similar to the 1971-72 financial year.

A Trip to Kooringa in 1850.  Reprinted from the Register in 1850.

An SA colonist who has not visited Burra has neglected to inspect a marvel.  It is a triumph of co-operative enterprise, liberality and economy, as credible to its directors as it is profitable to its owners and beneficial to the colony.  I enquired as to the most expeditious and cheapest mode of visiting Burra Burra.  A seat was suggested in the travelling chariot with the Directors on one of their periodic visits to the Mine.  Not knowing the Directors and not wishing to wait for such a grand occasion, I took a seat in the mail cart, a van-shaped vehicle covered with canvas and capable of containing about ten passengers.  The proprietor, whose easy manner put everyone in good humour, managed to stow twelve in it.  Even an old lady whose bonnet box was cruelly crushed declared that no one could be angry with Mr Chambers.  He went at a brisk pace through Hindmarsh, descending gullies and scaling banks with great confidence.  When conversation began when we got fairly on the lower road, each assured the rest that the dust was intolerable.  One of the passengers said he had just returned from California, of which he gave a graphic account.  He had saved a good sum at the Burra Burra and wishing to try his fortune in exchanging copper for gold, set off for San Francisco.  His degree of success could be judged from his wasted face and squalid appearance.  [His story then continues for several paragraphs.]

We left Adelaide at c. 3.30 p.m. and reached Gawler Town at about 7 p.m.  We put up at the Old Spot where Mr Schmidt maintained the reputation of the place established by its founder, Mr Calton.  The next morning the group divided.  The Kapunda passengers went on in a spring cart.  Burra Burra passengers continued in a spring cart without any covering.  The horses too were greatly inferior and had but one shoe among the four of them and one with a swollen leg and the others with worn hoofs, so that it was with great difficulty they were induced to move at all.  On arrival at She Oak Log there were no fresh horses ready and the mail was handed over to the driver of the spring cart, which could proceed much faster.  Progress to Kapunda was slow and one of the passengers had often to alight to flog the crippled horse, but eventually the driver was compelled to set it free – which had he done it at first would have saved much time.

We breakfasted at Ferrant’s just on entering Kapunda where everything was in good order and readiness, despite our very delayed arrival.  Newcomers of the roughest class joined the vehicle here and soon made a seat in the mail cart a very unenviable position.  One of the men was a fine specimen of the ‘old colonial bore’, who insisted on recounting his hair-raising adventures.  He was, however, eclipsed by the arrival of an Irish wench whose gross language and forward behaviour is beyond description.  The coarse behaviour and conversation continued till we reached the Burra Hotel.

At the Burra Hotel it was Saturday night and the part set aside for the sale of strong drink was full of people in every condition from sober through exhilarated and joyous to quarrelsome and singing and crying drunk.  Germans were singing a chorus in one corner and Welsh smelters were listening to a Celtic solo in another.  Cornish miners, English and Scotch mechanics and Irish labourers all combined to swell the mighty discord.

In contrast the hotel rooms were spacious, cool and well-furnished apartments, where the din of voices was softened by distance.  The waiter glided noiselessly about and I enjoyed a hearty dinner and went out for a moonlight view of Kooringa.  It differed in no respect from any other thriving town.  There were a number of large shops and a great concourse of people marketing in a quiet and orderly fashion.  I did not see one policeman, nor any occasion for one.

(Note [presumably by Ian Auhl]: the towns of Redruth and Aberdeen had only been laid out in August 1849, which explains why the writer does not refer to them.  The population of Kooringa including the dugouts was 4,300 in 1850.)

The next day was Sunday and the Sabbath was strictly observed.  Besides the [Anglican] Church there were chapels for the Wesleyans, Independents and Primitive Methodists and the Roman Catholics and divine service in a private house.

There are several streets and the houses are generally well built.  In some places are rows of substantial stone cottages built by the company.  The chimneys of one of them having as much masonry as would suffice for two of the flimsy building society cottages which disgrace the streets of Adelaide.  There seems to be an abundance of good stone in Kooringa, which the inhabitants are putting to good use.

One of Kooringa’s most singular features is the subterranean habitations of ‘The Creek’.  For a distance of more than two miles the banks of a ravine are perforated with vaulted chambers in which a populous are living in apparent health and comfort.  From above those dwellings (to which some future etymologist, with the accuracy characteristic of his study, will trace the name of Burra (Burrow)), present a squalid, but exceedingly diversified and picturesque appearance.  Some are quite cottage-like in their exterior, having stone fronts, well proportioned doors and windows, with verandahs and fences guarding the approach.  In those cases the earth is cut away to give a perpendicular front and that secures a sort of terrace before the door.  But in many instances there is merely a horizontal cut running far enough into the bank to gain a height for an approach to a door with a similar cut of smaller proportions for a window and the rest of the house is a perforation of the bank continued from these apertures.  In most cases the chimney is level with the surface, or raised a foot or two by a pile of a few stones or partially embedding a headless flour or ale cask.  Accidents sometimes happen when night walkers fall down the chimneys.  Their arms generally arrest their descent, but they remain caught until rescued by an occupant from below, either furious or friendly as the case may be.

On Monday I visited the Mine, which is situated on the side of a hill.  A considerable stream of water flows down the acclivity fed by the steam engine, which works incessantly day and night raising nearly 800 gallons of water every minute.  Diverted into suitable channels, it carries on the work of washing ore and an immense space is occupied by heaps of rich green and blue ore in every stage of preparation, from the immense masses sent up by the miners to be washed and pulverised and carefully packed into canvas bags for removal by bullock drays to the port, or to the smelting works of the Patent Copper Co. on the other side of the creek.  Under extensive sheds men and boys of all sizes carry on the operation of ore crushing etc.

The revolving whims and ceaseless stroke of the immense pump excited at once a dread and uneasy desire to visit the workings underground.  Introduced by Captain Roach to the Captain’s Changing Room, I was equipped with a candle in one hand and a piece of tempered clay in the other.  I followed the guide to whose care Captain Roach assigned me.  We went under a shed near a whim and the top of a ladder protruded from a hole just large enough to allow a man to descend.  My guide lit the candle and surrounded it with tempered clay, which he stuck against my hat and told me to follow him.  We descended about 16 feet to a landing and then took another ladder and so on until we had reached 30 fathoms.  My guide said we were in Peacock’s level and introduced me to several chambers where vast deposits of malachite and other rich ores had been found.  In some places the level had been excavated through solid rock and in other parts the earth was soft and damp and there the passage was strongly timbered and boarded.  No expense seemed to be spared in securing the comfort and safety of the workers.  In places several inches of water, apparently pure and clear, flowed along the level, but above it was a boarded floor, along which the miners walked dry shod.  I frequently came to men at work.  Some said the ore they were getting was poor, but would be called very rich in England.  Others were operating on large fronts of malachite.  They said the mineral was richer and more abundant at the 40 fathom level, but as there was some feet of water in the level and the footway was wet, I had no desire to go deeper.  In the 30 fathom level I met Captain Matthews, who greeted me courteously and led me to several most remarkable places.  On emerging into the light of day I returned to the Captain’s Change Room, where the kindness of Captain Roach allowed me to make a very needful toilet.

After taking leave of Captain Roach I walked towards the works of the Patent Copper Co., but the sight of the flowing furnaces on such a hot day quite evaporated my curiosity and I returned to the Burra Hotel just in time to be present at a public meeting of the inhabitants of Kooringa and the surrounding townships.

The meeting had been called to consider the propriety of demanding municipal institutions for the united townships, but in fact the propositions put did not mention this at all.  I afterwards found that the words intimating this cause were inserted into the requisition calling the meeting to please the few who think with the Resident Magistrate that such is desirable, but the majority fear the expense of a corporation would more than outweigh its advantages and so avoided the subject.

Other matters observed:

There is a flourishing Oddfellows’ Lodge there of the Manchester Unity and it meets in a splendid room recently added to the Burra Hotel.  It possesses a library of 1,000 volumes from which it lends books at a cheap rate to all who wish to avail themselves of such a service.

The people generally think residence in the creek unhealthy, and it is certain that fever prevails there occasionally.  To me, however, the women and children appeared both numerous and healthy and on the Sunday I was in Kooringa it turned out a vast concourse of well-dressed persons who wound their way to different houses of worship.  It is thought there is a population in the creek of about 1,000 and there are at least 200 houses there.  The approaching census will give the correct numbers.  The people complain of the want of a local court of full jurisdiction and are ashamed of the hovel in which their respected Magistrate disposes justice.  There are fears that the engine pump of the mine will exhaust all the wells in the town – several having gone dry since it has been at work.

The return to Adelaide presented the same dust and delays for want of horses.

Note [Again presumably by Ian Auhl]: this three day journey to Burra in 1880 cost $2 plus overnight expenses at Gawler and Kapunda.  The trip by Mail Cart went via Gawler, Sheoak Log, Kapunda, Tothill’s Creek, Apoinga, Emu Springs and Sod Hut.  Hornsby’s hotel still stands at Apoinga.  The Burra Hotel was later the Burra Hospital and the last of the old building was demolished in 1967.

Burra High School.  Mr E.C. Allen MP asked the Minister of education for information concerning the new High School site and development in Burra.  A new site was purchased about three years ago, but the Public Works Committee recently visited Burra and was unhappy about the site.  Hon. Hugh Hudson said in reply that no decision had yet been made.  Following a visit to Burra and consultation there, it had been agreed that acquiring additional land in the immediate proximity to the Primary School would allow both schools to be redeveloped on the existing site and this would offer advantages in the sharing of facilities.  The representative bodies of the schools and the town endorsed this alternative plan.  Public Building Department has been asked to prepare a sit plan showing future land requirements and the relationship of buildings to recreational grounds etc.  This will involve lad acquisition and redesigned plans and inevitably delay the building program.  Those involved accepted this because of the long term advantage.  The program will proceed as rapidly as possible.

Burra Copper Festival

Burra Show

The gate takings reflect the increased number of visitors.  $1,075 compared with $655 last year.  Door takings at the Ball in the Town Hall were $875 and for the teenage dance in the RSL Hall $165.

The Show was opened by the Governor of SA Sir Mark Oliphant in fine weather.  Show President, Mr R. Mason, introduced the Governor, whose speech is printed.

The display of farm machinery and cars was much larger than usual.

Art attracted a great diversity of entries with a strong junior section.

Budgerigars attracted entries of varying standard.

Cookery was of high standard and the children’s section was very pleasing.

Flowers were a poorer standard than usual, but the children’s entries were good.

Goat entries were larger this year, but of varying quality, though the best were excellent.

Needlework was of a higher standard than usual.

Pigs were revived as a section this year and all the exhibits were good types.

The Sheep Section produced good commercial sheep in both the restricted and poll sections.  The Champion Poll Ram was outstanding.  Entry numbers should have been better.

In the strong wool section the ewes were much stronger than the rams.

In the medium wool sheep, ram numbers were low, but competition for ewes was good.

Vegetable entries were down in numbers due to the poor season, but of reasonably good quality.

Fleeces on display were commendable.

Copper Festival

Unveiling the Peacock Chimney Plaque

Burra people were staggered by the numbers present.  Thousands of people gathered for the event.  Gusty winds whipped round the small yellow curtain covering the plaque and around the long dresses, capes and bonnets of the ladies and young girls in nineteenth century costume.  Men and boys in clothes of the miners added authenticity.  A number of veteran cars and horse drawn vehicles added to the scene and the Police Band gave a martial flavour to the procession.  After the unveiling the procession was reformed and followed the band back to Market Square where it played for the afternoon.  At the chimney Sir Mark & Lady Oliphant were met by National Trust President, Mr G. O’Connor, who welcomed than and the large crowd.  Mr O’Connor told the story of the reconstruction.  They had not at first realised the size of the task, but that had been compensated for by the degree of satisfaction at its completion.  During the resiting some of the massive stones had been broken and new ones had to be cut.  The bricks had crumbled to dust and had to be replaced.  The new brickwork had not quite the grace and charm of the old, but a century of Burra winters will mellow it.  He called on Sir Mark to perform the ceremony.

[Sir Mark’s speech is printed.]

A vote of thanks was moved by Major General G.W. Symes, Vice-President of the National Trust of SA.

Decentralisation of the Post Office Telecommunications Management Authority

Burra is one place being considered as a possible headquarters for this move.  Unfortunately its geographical position counts against it.  As 150 persons would be employed, it would mean the influx of 400-500 people.  Mr R.T. Prior, an old Burra boy has been appointed to the position of Area Manager Telecommunications for the Mid North, Upper North, Far North and Eyre Peninsula of SA.  Mr Prior (Ray) called on the Chairman of the District Council, Mr R.J. Jeffery, and the District Clerk, Mr T.G. Perry, on 25 October to discuss the proposal as part of his familiarisation with the vast area concerned.

[The article runs in all for some 3½ columns, but as nothing eventuated and most of it is about changes in general in telecommunications, it is of no great consequence.]

Ray Prior was born on his father’s farm in the Springbank-Hanson area and educated at Copperhouse School and Burra High School, where he was a House Leader and Prefect.  He has 36 years experience with the department.  For some years he was in charge of the Planning & Development of Telecommunications across SA and later was Superintendent of the Service Branch – a branch he entered some 25 years earlier as a trainee telephonist.  His most recent post was Metropolitan Manager of Telecommunications Division.  He served at sea in the RANVR in WWII, but was a telegraphist at Darwin in 1942 when the Post Office was bombed.  A more enjoyable experience was serving as Communications Officer on the State Royal Visit Committee for a number of Royal Visits to SA and the NT.  As a result he and his wife (nee Miss Maisie Peters of Riverton) have been presented to royalty on a number of occasions.  He has also for many years been associated with the Postal Institute, of which he is a Life Member.

Burra Copper Festival.  The committee met on 23 October to discuss the next Festival.  The weekend was a great success and proceeds will total $2,500.  This will be placed in the hands of the Burra District Tourist Promotion Committee, which no doubt will seek subsidies to supplement the usefulness of the money.

Samin Ltd’s Stage 2 Program

The commencement of stage 2 is scheduled for September 1973.  The copper ore body at Burra was worked over by hand picking as a high grade deposit between 1845 and 1877, contributing valuable wealth to the state at a critical time.  It was later worked on a small scale by the Burr [Burra] Copper Co. 1901-07.  No further work of importance was undertaken till December 1961 when the SA Department of Mines began investigation.  By December 1961 they had discovered interesting reserves of oxidised copper ore.  Late in 1969 Samin Ltd acquired the leases and with State Government assistance in providing necessary infrastructure, it commenced to develop the property.

Samin and Australian Mineral Development Laboratories in Adelaide (Amdel) designed a plant utilising an ammonia leaching process capable of treating 250 tons of ore per day.  The plant, which commenced operation as the first stage of the development, is producing c. 90 tons of copper concentrate per month.  The plant has also been used to provide the metallurgical information needed to design the stage 2 plant.  This will considerably increase throughput and recovery.  The mining rate will increase to 400,000 tons of ore per year and production to about 6,500 tons of copper concentrate.  The new plant involves roasting in a roaster 64 feet high, with 12 hearths, fired by natural gas, before treatment.  Santos is supplying the natural gas from the Moomba-Adelaide main via a 14 mile branch line commissioned from the Natural Gas Pipelines Authority.  Tenders for this line are expected to be called in January with construction in February-April 1973.  The heat from the waste gases and from the hot material leaving the roaster will generate steam for other process work.  The waste gases will be filtered to be completely clean before discharge.  After roasting the ore will be ground to a fine powder in a 9 ft diameter x 17 ft long ball mill driven by an 11,000 volt motor.  The diameter of this 1,100 h.p. motor is over 12 ft and it weighs nearly 20 tons.  This is one of the largest motors connected to the ETSA system and special provisions have been made to protect other consumers from interference.  ETSA will also be installing two 1,500 KVA transformers to cope with the increased load from other plant motors.  After grinding the copper will be extracted from the calcined ore by agitation leaching instead of the present percolation leaching method.  The new tanks for this have been installed and are set in the ground to eliminate possible spillage.  Stainless steel pressure filters will ensure all ammonia fumes are contained.  Most other sections of the existing plant will also be extended.  A.L. Clode & Son have already enlarged the maintenance workshop.

Employment will not be greatly increased by this development.

Burra Progress Association was formed on 1 August 1939.  The late F.T. Sara was Chairman and Mr John Bowles was Secretary.  Its last meeting was on 1 December 1955 when it had a credit balance of £75-4-7.  This has grown with interest to be now $232.60.  In March 1956, when the building of the swimming pool was under discussion, the Progress Association went into recess because it was the same few people who would be involved with the new project.  Now only two local signatories remain in C.H. Cummins and H.J. Topsfield and it has been decided to wind up its financial concerns.  Yesterday it was decided to hand the balance to the Tourist Promotion Committee President, Mr W. Scott.

Ian Auhl writes:

It was with mixed feelings that I read in the Sunday Mail of 5 November 1972 the disappointment of an overseas tourist who drove to Burra and expected to see the old open cut and wander freely around the old mine area.  None of the brochures he said indicated that people could not get near the old buildings or the old mines.  This highlights the need for more up-to-date publicity.  A somewhat misleading impression could be given by the current Council brochure, the National Trust-Ampol film and the Burra Sketchbook.  These date from 1967, 1967 and 1968 respectively and at that time the re-opening of the mine seemed a very remote possibility.  This year the Council is to bring out an up-to-date tourist brochure.  Also in 1973 I hope a new Burra book called Burra in Colour will be available.  Rigby Ltd has given a young photographer Peter Finch and me the contract to produce the book.  This will bring the Burra story up-to-date.  The film cannot be up-dated and is now an historic record in colour of the mine area prior to the present mining operations.  What is needed is a new film.  One can understand the visitor’s disappointment and it is a pity Dr McKinnon was not referred to Mr Rich or Mr O’Connor, as I am sure he would have been shown around the mine area.  In any case most of the mine buildings are still accessible.  Graves’ Pump House has been spared and the [Peacock’s] chimney resited – a reasonable compromise.  I, like Mr Baulderstone, felt a keen disappointment at the loss of the old mine area and some of the mine buildings.  I have also been disappointed that other historic buildings in the town have been bulldozed without knowledge or consideration of their tourist value.  Samin has shown goodwill and the National Trust and Council have, I believe, come to respect each other’s points of view. Tourism and mining cannot be separate developments; it is no longer practicable.  Such statements as those made by Dr A.J. McKinnon are fair comment and must be taken into account.

Lawn Tennis.  Six representatives of the SA Lawn Tennis Association visited Burra on Sunday and coached 42 youngsters of the Burra Association.  Coaches were Mr Tom Gray and his two sons, Mr Ray Thiele and two ladies.

Miss Gertrude Jordan writes from Ashfield, Sydney of her memories of the day her brother Arthur climbed the old Smelts Chimney and she enclosed a photo of her class at Burra School in 1897 or early 1898.  In a PS she adds: ‘I can remember when Mr Holder (Sir Frederick Holder) had a lot to do with the Record.’

[See Burra Record 57, 45, 10 Nov. 1936, page 3: Memories of Burra by Elizabeth A. Ward.  Arthur Jordan was at the time a schoolboy of 12 years of age, son of the late J.D. Jordan, watchmaker, of Kooringa.  Arthur Dawson Jordan born 8 March 1873 Kooringa: died 28 October 1965, Gawler.  See also 88, 5 (4), 9 Feb. 1965, page 6. Gertrude May Jordan 1882-1973.  Note if she was born in 1882 she was unlikely to have been at school as late as 1897 or 1898.]

Harold Foote sent a letter with a couple of old photos.  One showed Morphett’s Shaft with the big cable wheel and Johnny Green still in position.  He said the roofs were on the Engine Houses and their stair cases in place.  He said that when in the boys scouts they used to jump out of the top windows through the ‘shoots’ or were caught in ground sheets by other scouts.  The other photo showed the first Kooringa Methodist Church.

Mr Binks-Williams writes a letter citing one he received recently from Harold Foote concerning the late Joe Lloyd and how much Mr Lloyd helped the bowling club.  He was always willing to do voluntary work – nailing hundreds of palings on the new fence and carrying ‘tons’ of cement – and of the garden he made and kept bright with flowers – and, of course, about his tournament wins.  Binks concludes by saying how much the same could be said of Harold Foote with respect to work around the bowling club.

Seven spoon-drains or cement fords have been placed in the Hundred of Ayers.  $2,000 has been spent on the old reformatory at Burra North.  Repairs are being made to the parapet and some interior stone work.  The rest has gone on kerbing and water tables throughout the town, with work in Thames Street, Best Place, Young, Queen, Church and Hill Streets among others.  Applications for funds have come from the Farrell Flat Golf Club, Burra Show Society and the Booborowie Recreation Committee to assist with updating buildings under their care.

Fyfe, who had held the position for 13 years, Sister L.A. Parker has been appointed Matron from 7 December.  She comes from Katamatite and has been at Burra Hospital for 12 months.

Deputation to the Minister of Local Government

Following the public meeting at Booborowie over the increase in rates, a deputation has waited on the Minister, the Hon. G.T. Virgo.  They pointed out that grants to the Burra Burra Council have decreased by $50,000 over three years.  They sought increased funding to enable the budget to balance without the current increase in rates.  The increase in rates was a response to the sharp decline in Government grants for road works.  As a result of the previous Government policy the Council had built up an efficient plant and staff and incurred debts in the purchase of equipment, which had to be serviced.  The deputation had complete confidence in the Council, but could not accept the hardship caused by the rate increase. They provided figures to support their claims:

Money collected in rates 	1971-72	$80,370

1972-73	$99,276

Government Road Grants	1969-70	$141,976

1970-71	$131,512 (difference is a carry forward)

1971-72	$107,415

1972-73	$81,990

Comparison of different Council rates within a ten miles radius for similar land:

Burra Burra DC	890 acres	rates $259.76

Adjoining Council	868 acres	rates $134.40

Another adjoining Council	875 acres	rates $265.14

This shows our rates are equal to one and well above the other, showing we are pulling our weight as ratepayers.  The town is awakening to tourism and visitor numbers are growing, but a great need exists for a sealed road in an east-west direction.  There has been a general increase in the revenue allotted to the Highways Department, but the debit orders to the northern areas have remained constant and to the Burra Burra Council have been reduced.  Rate income must be reduced by $20,000.

This can only be done by:

Reducing the rural activities of Council.

Disposal of plant and equipment.

Retention of plant and equipment, but operating on a reduced scale with retrenchment of five or six men.

Highways Department provides grant allocation to enable the Council to meet loan and operational commitments until the rural community recovers from the restricted fiancé that has been and largely still is in place.

The Government supports the Council to provide for tourist activity in Burra as the rural sector has provided the present facilities and services.

Burra Mine

Work at the mine so far has been of a preparatory nature.  De-watering of the open cut will start some time in June 1973, or perhaps in the following year.  The water level will probably be lowered to 1,540 ft above sea level or 60 ft below the present level and would not then be lowered further for two years.  Once started, pumping will continue for the life of the operation.  The equipment will be capable of handling 1,000 gallons per minute.  Notification of the decision to commence pumping will be given in due course.

Break-in.  Burra Motor Co. premises have been broke into for the third time this year.  Articles valued at c. $130 were stolen on the night of 28 November.

Commonwealth Secondary Scholarships have been awarded to five Burra High School students this year.  They are valued at $400 each, to be used over two years.  Winners are: Paul Hogan, Jennifer Holmes, John Lewis, Grant Maxted and Necia Mickel.

Centenary of the Burra Burra DC

At the Centenary Dinner at the Town Hall last week the Chairman Mr Jeffery welcomed guests and introduced the Minister of Local Government Hon. G.T. Virgo, who presented long service certificates to R.J. Jeffery (17 Years), E.T. Baulderstone (24 years) and R.J. White (10 years).  [Three photos are printed.]

[Mr Virgo began his speech with the usual thank yous for the invitation and to the ladies providing the dinner.  He moved on to make the usual references to Burra’s past role as a mining centre which had saved SA’s economy in the mid 19th century.  He said the re-opened mine is expected to run for 15 to 20 years and to generate some $119-$120 million.  He then went on to consider the role of tourism.]

Burra has a very important role to play in tourism.  In a quick look around to see the old miners’ cottages I was very pleased to see the standard of preservation.  I think these cottages mean something as far as Burra is concerned and as far as tourism is concerned.  You may think it worth while pooling your tourist resources with adjoining areas so that the region can provide more than just a one or two day trip.  Today the tourist is looking for more than coming to Burra to see mine workings and cottages and the National Trust Museum.  They are looking for a package of things to do perhaps over four or five days or a week.  A portion of the growing tourist expenditure in Australia can come to Burra provided Burra people are prepared to display the necessary initiative and encourage people in the area to advertise the fact they have tourist potential.  With respect to ‘that road’ which must receive serious consideration.  While it is acknowledged that it is essential as far as this region is concerned, it is also acknowledged that the Highways Department funds are allocated on the needs of the whole state and so the Department may not give it the same priority as it sifts through the pleas and requests of 157 local governing bodies in SA.

Concerning local government boundaries.  If local government by a majority want to have a commission to look into boundaries, I am prepared to have one.  If not, then one will not be established.

Mr Brian Riggs responded.  As well as thanking Mr Virgo he introduced Mr Ian Auhl’s booklet on the Council’s Centenary and thanked the Floral Art Club for the floral arrangements, the ladies [listed] for the catering and the Clerk, Tom Perry, for making the co-ordinating arrangements for the dinner.

Mr Virgo then presented the long service awards as stated above.

[Photo of the unveiling of the plaque.]

Ian Auhl spoke of the booklet on the Council’s Centenary and pointed out the difficulties Burra had in getting local government – it took twenty years for a District Council and another four for the town to get a Corporation.  You, [Mr Virgo] made the remark that Burra once upon a time saved South Australia.  I say that it is high time that South Australia saved Burra.  My final comment is that if you want to save Burra build that bloody road from Morgan to here!

Angela Quinn, who is training and working with the Missionary Sisters of Service in Tasmania, wrote to the paper with congratulations on the Copper festival and on the paper’s souvenir issue of 10 October and with Christmas wishes for all.  She then contributes almost half a column on the work of the Order of Missionary Sisters of Service.

Headmaster’s Report for 1972

I welcome Inspector Mr Louis Kloeden, to the platform along with Mrs Kloeden, a Senior Mistress and Art Teacher.

The year began with an enrolment of 160 and we expect it to be 200 by 1975.

The students have been co-operative and responsible and the prefects and house captains most conscientious in their duties.  Students have done well in helping with the upkeep of the grounds.  A Valedictory Service was held last Sunday in the Anglican Church.

We congratulate Commonwealth Scholarship winners Paul Hogan, Jennifer Holmes, John Lewis, Grant Maxted, Necia Mickel, John Bishop, Helen Beare and Kathy Edwards.

[He then went on to thank the staff and the High School Council.]

Next year Miss Baron and Mr Costello are both getting married and will be transferring to Dover Gardens and Findon respectively.  Miss Lintern has resigned to take a Social Science course at Flinders University.  Mr Allen has been promoted at ASM at Millicent High School.  Their replacements are not yet known.

The Parents & Friends have helped the school with a number of purchases including a photo-copying machine ($850) and library books ($400).

[He then spoke briefly of sports and extra-curricular activities.]

In 1973 there will be no ‘2’ track students and only ‘0’ and ‘1’ track.  All 1st year students will be offered Art as an alternative to French.  1973 will see the introduction of a Hire Book Scheme.

A new Commonwealth Grant next year will see the school receive some $2,750 worth of equipment including books, films, cassettes etc. over three years.

With respect to the new school.  New plans have been drawn up and approved.  It is likely the boys’ craft block and the science block areas will be the site for the new school and Wardle’s paddock the recreation area.  No commencement date has yet been set.

Mr Kloeden was then introduced.

Characteristics of the 1972 paper.

There was quite a reasonable coverage of local issues and with a fairly wide interpretation of ‘local’; ranging from Saddleworth to Hallett and Robertstown.

There are quite a few mistakes in setting, however, and not all are subsequently corrected, which leaves some puzzling items.  Some of the major news items are general interest, rather than local.

Allocation of material to pages is rather elastic, but the following is typical.

Page 1.

Solidly devoted to news.

Page 2.

Some large local advertisements with sports results,

Sales notices and public notices are sometimes here and sometimes on page 6 or split between the two.

Page 3.

Typically a heavy dose of large advertisements with perhaps one column of news.

Pages 4 & 5.

Generally little news except for sports results and often a large section of 50 and 25 years ago.

Page 6.

Large advertisements for about half the page.  The Cash Column (small classified advertisements) for at least one column.  Some public notices and other small advertisements.

Page 7.

‘Out and About’ – small snippets of local news.

Further local news and sports.  At least half a page of advertising.

Page. 8

Large advertisements for about four columns.  Reports from various District Councils and perhaps some other news.

New Burra Buildings in 1973 will be worth c. $4 million.

Stage 2 of the treatment Plant at the Burra Mine is estimated to cost over $3 million.

The Burra Hospital will get 40 beds and a new maternity floor, all on one level, at a cost of $220,000.

Barker of Baldina Cottage Homes on the western side of the Hospital are expected to cost c. $90,000.  The late Mr J.R. Barker bequeathed $70,000 and there was a Commonwealth subsidy.

Burra Mine.  Envirotech Australia Pty Ltd is building the multiple hearth furnace for Samin Ltd for the reduction roasting plant and the first two sections of four are being positioned.  [Photograph.]  The plant will cost $1.2 million; will be c. 26 ft in diameter and 85 ft high.  It will be a 12 hearth, multiple hearth type furnace and will be equipped for recovering heat from the furnace flue, gases and roasted ore, together with cyclonic and bag type dust collection and should be operational this year.  It will calcine 1,000 tons of crushed ore per day, using natural gas as fuel.  Parts of the roaster came from Adelaide by two low loaders operated by J.W. Bourne Ltd.  The width forced a roundabout route via Snowtown, Gladstone, Crystal Brook, Jamestown and Hallett and took two days with lifting of overhead wires taking much of the time.  The third and fourth sections arrived on Wednesday after a similar journey.

Barker Cottage Homes are progressing satisfactorily.  So far seven applications have been received by the Board of Management and this leaves two vacant units.  Construction is by the local firm of D.T. Jacka & Co. and it is expected that the units will be ready for occupation by the end of March or early April.  One advantage will be the nearness to the Hospital.  [Photograph.]

Burra Hospital extensions will incorporate a new Maternity Wing, kitchen and staff dining room, as well as three additional share wards and a children’s ward for the General Hospital.  All will be on the same level.  [The old hospital had always been plagued by different levels throughout.]  The new wing will include three private wards, a share ward, nursery and a TV room for patients.  The existing verandah on the front of the building will be extended on the eastern end to link with the new building and on the western end a new sunroom for patients will be erected.  Kennett Bros of Adelaide are expected to complete the work in April or May.  The area under the built-up building will house rain water tanks.  [Photograph.]

Floods.  The Eastern Road is still impassable beyond Woolgangi.  Water from the north means watercourses is still flowing and all dams and lagoons are reported full.

The mail contractors deferred the Friday delivery, but have decided to ‘give it a go’ this morning.

The Morgan Road was closed for a few days after the rain.

The Burra Creek reached the Murray, but the flow apparently came from the tributaries flowing from the northeast pastoral country.  A flow of the creek from Burra to Morgan occurred about 25 years ago, when the watercourse at Florieton was about three miles wide.

Burra Mine - Samin Ltd now has the four sections of the new roaster in position, though further equipment is yet to be mounted.  There are twelve square holes running vertically up the tower, which are entries to each of the roaster hearths.  The hearths will be constructed in special refractory bricks and castable materials and work on this began yesterday.  It is expected to take about three months.  On the top there will be a safety stack and four ‘cyclones’.  The latter will separate grit from the exhaust gases.  These will then pass through a large filter to remove any remaining dust, which will then be recycled into the furnace.

[Photographs of the operation are included.]

Patron	Rex C. Warnes

President	Graham Kellock

Senior Vice-President	Ron Shipard

Junior Vice-President	Neil Hurst

Secretary	Darrell H. Field

R.E. Mason presented the President’s Report for 1972:

The show was held on 7 October and was opened by the Governor of SA, Sir Mark Oliphant, accompanied by Lady Oliphant.  This was the first activity of the Copper festival weekend and attendance almost doubled that of last year.  The weather was unsettled, with dust at first, but it improved later.  The new sections for pigs and cattle were a success and ring events were popular, as were the dodgem cars at the sideshows.  Sheep shearing was popular too and the Agriculture Pavilion was filled to capacity.  School exhibits were popular and the industrial displays were well patronised.  The wool display was of a high standard, but sheep numbers were very low.  The Flower Pavilion was a picture.

A New Golf Course is taking shape in the racecourse area.  The land was offered to the Burra Burra DC by the Burra Sports Syndicate and the Council has acquired the adjoining land known as Elders and the Quarry Paddocks to develop a sports and recreation ground.  The Golf Club enlisted the aid of Murray Crafter of Glenelg Golf Club to design a new gold course.  His plans were accepted in November 1972.  Work began in December on the north face of Quarry Hill.  Putting surfaces were laid in the new positions at a working bee on 25 February except for three still under preparation.  Thanks go to Lyell Quinn of Roche Bros. for grading Quarry Hill and carting material etc., to the DC for making earth-moving equipment available, to Bill Byles & Gino Santella for driving the machinery and to Ron Moreland for ensuring its availability when required.

President’s Report

The dominant item for the year was Peacock’s chimney.  Last year the stonework had been completed and the brick top begun.  After months of frustratingly slow progress the brickwork was topped, but so badly executed as to be totally unacceptable.  Eventually the contractor agreed and the brickwork was removed.  Before rebuilding commenced the contractor went bankrupt.  The services were then obtained of O’Neill & Clayton, who did a first class job.  Sir Mark Oliphant unveiled the plaque [at the completed chimney] on 8 October 1972.  In the year visits were made to Tanunda and Renmark branches.  Jamestown has given us a complete railway signal tower and signal.

Burra Mine – Samin Ltd.

E.C. Allen MP asked the Premier, Mr Dunstan, about the possible effects on ground water levels of the second stage operations of Samin Ltd at Burra.  This is estimated to pump 1½ million gallons of water a day from the mine to keep water levels below operating levels.  Landowners would like to see it replaced underground if possible.

Mr Allen asked if the water level at the Bon Accord shaft was falling – it being the present source of water for the mine’s operation.

Mr Bakewell, secretary to the Minister of development and Mines, advises that a survey of bores within 8 km is being undertaken so that drawdown can be determined during a test later in the year.  It is believed unlikely bores further away will be affected.  Of the 91 bores located, 22 are not in use, 8 provide domestic supplies, 59 are for stock and 2 are for irrigation.  The mine is expected to have a relatively short life and the artificial recharge of the aquifers is not considered to be beneficial.  No significant fall in the level of water at the Bon Accord shaft has been noted.  The level in the open cut has fallen about 12 inches in the summer and this is considered normal.

Burra Football Club AGM

President G.M .Kellock reported on the year.  Junior Colts won the premiership without losing a game for the year.  Though less successful, the Senior Colts provided their supporters with good football.  ‘B’ Grade ended up with the wooden spoon.  The ‘A’ Grade team did better, winning through to the Preliminary Final and losing that by just a few points.  Kevin Lane is congratulated on his five years as senior coach, in which time the club has taken out two premierships and was twice runner-up.  He has asked to be relieved of this task for 1973 and as a consequence D. Kellock has been appointed.  Gate takings in 1972 were double those of 1971 and the increased admission from 40 to 50 cents only accounts for a small part of this.  Elected for 1973:

President	J. Secomb

Vice-Presidents	T. Lehmann & R. Nicholls

Secretary	A. Day

Treasurer	H. Heitbrink

Booborowie Water.  The Department of Mines has been monitoring levels and salinity in 53 bores since May 1971 in the Booborowie Valley. 1972 levels are about one metre lower than 1971 levels, as a consequence of reduced winter rains.  No drastic depletion of the aquifer is evident.  It is expected further boring this year will determine more precisely the hydrological limits, rate of recharge and the capacity of the valley.

Burra Rural Youth will host members of seven other clubs in the Zone at a rally next weekend.

[The program of events is printed.]

Koonaburra Cricket Club honoured Ron Pearse with life membership at a dinner at the Royal Exchange Hotel on Saturday last.

Burra Primary School Council AGM

The primary school headmaster Mr S. Allan feels teachers need conferences and observation days because of rapidly changing educational ideas and improved methods.  About 35 parents and teachers attended the meeting.  The new council members are Mr J. Ayliffe, Mrs M. Alderson, Mr S. Allan, Mrs P. Buckton, Mrs E. Carpenter, Mr G. Nourse, Mr C. O’Connor, Mr R. Shipard, Mrs C. Stockman, Mrs J. Tiver, Mrs Betty Thamm and Mr Brian Thamm.

At their first meeting after the AGM the Council elected Mr I. Allen as Chairman, Mr A. Baulderstone as Vice-Chairman and Mr D. Lloyd as Secretary-Treasurer.

The Chairman’s report covers the Sports Day and Combined Sports Day at Hallett.

Rhe combined sports this year will be held on 13 April.

Swimming meets have been held twice at Riverton; on 24 March 1972 and 16 March 1973.  Burra won the first meet by 19 points and the second by 3.  The school competition at the Burra Pool was held on 6 December.  Fund raising for 1972 saw the men’s group raise and sell an onion crop for $159.  Snacks for visitors to the Copper Festival in October were a community service rather than a fund raiser.

Not as much has been spent on the school this year because the High School is to be relocated and the Primary School will be recast about the existing High school and Primary School buildings.  Also further clarification is needed about the division of responsibilities between the Department and the parent body for the supply of equipment and teaching aids.  Some additional sports equipment was erected.

Three new teachers were welcomed: Miss Dargie, Miss Abbot and Mrs Henderson.  Mrs Shattock, Mrs Keller and Mrs Short have helped during periods of staff shortage.

After six years as Secretary-Treasurer Lewis Moore was transferred from Burra and we thank him.  Don Lloyd has taken his place.  Committees have worked well and merit our thanks.  Mr Allan spoke on the planned activities for the coming year.  The full staff is now 8 teachers, 1 typist, 1 librarian and 2 teacher-aides.  The acquisition of two teacher-aides has been a tremendous help, especially in the Infant Section.  This year I intend to set up the old book room as an area for extra help lessons and as a room for group reading to teacher-aides.  Changing ideas and methods mean teachers need to go to conferences and observation days.  Children should have at least one excursion a year.

Tennis Clubs

Separate meetings of the Aberdeen and Kooringa Tennis Clubs to discuss amalgamation have resulted in a recommendation to go ahead and a meeting is consequently scheduled for the Aberdeen Football Club Rooms at 8 p.m. tomorrow.  Last season Aberdeen had six teams: Two ‘A’, 3 ‘B’ and a Junior.  Kooringa had four teams: 1 ‘A’, 2 ‘B’ and a Junior.  Aberdeen has its own five courts, while Kooringa has been renting courts from the school.

It is thought the amalgamated club would be likely to ask Council permission for three more courts adjacent to their present courts at Burra North.

Barkers of Baldina Cottage Homes have been occupied now for a few weeks, but they will officially be opened by Miss Priscilla Brown, step-daughter of the late J.R. Barker, at 2.30 p.m. next Sunday.  There is sufficient land available for a further nine units and it is the intention of the Board to proceed immediately with site preparation and erect the additional units as finance permits.

Burra Mine

The new ore roaster being constructed by Envirotech Australia Pty Ltd for Samin Ltd’s Phase 2 extension at the Burra Mine is nearing completion.

[Photo of Roaster Shell, showing ‘portholes’ indicating the spacing of the 12 hearths inside.

Photo of centre column and form work prepared for constructing one of the hearths.]

Some 400 tons of refractory fire bricks have been bought from Kaiser Refractories Plant at Uandarra, NSW.

The work on the hearths is expected to be completed by the end of May.  The ore enters at the top of the roaster and is circulated by means of rake arms from hearth to hearth to reach the floor at 1,200°F.  It is then carried by means of a heat resistant stainless steel screw conveyor to a 65 ton rotary unit to be cooled to 250°F in preparation for further processing.

Barkers of Baldina Aged Cottage Homes were opened by Miss Priscilla Brown, step-daughter of the late J.R. Barker.  Mr R.B. Jennison, Vice Chairman of the Board of Management, welcomed those present.  The Chairman of the District Council Mr Roy Jeffery addressed the meeting.  The late John Robert Barker had taken over the running of ‘Baldina’ on the completion of his education [and had bequeathed the bulk of the funds that enabled the construction of the cottages].  Mr Max Gilgen, Assistant Director of Social Security in SA, also spoke, welcoming this addition to the services to the Burra Community.  He spoke on the role of the Department and the various types of accommodation it helps to fund.  The Commonwealth granted $47,600, which represented the maximum available for the project.  Mr Ron Pearse, Chairman of the Board of Management, outlined Mr Barker’s wishes in planning the cottages.  There is sufficient money in hand to level a site for a further nine units, which will be built as soon as finance allows.  Miss Brown then gave a short address expressing her satisfaction with the building and furnishing of the homes, before declaring them open.  [Photograph of J.R. Barker.]

Tennis.  The Final report of the Aberdeen Tennis Club.

The club started about 50 years ago and at the end of the 1972-73 season has amalgamated with the Kooringa club to form the Burra Tennis Club.  The season began with a fresh coat of paint on the Clubhouse.  We fielded 2 ‘A’ teams, 3 ‘B’ teams and a junior team.  The White ‘A’ team were premiers.  The ‘B’ Purple team lost their final to Spalding and the Juniors also lost to Kooringa.  The Easter Tournament was again a success, as were fund-raising efforts throughout the year.  There was also a successful junior tournament.  We were sorry to farewell our President, Dennis O’Reilly, his wife Rona and family, at the end of the season, when they relocated to New Zealand.  We thank them for their hard work.  The season ended with a tea at the Aberdeen Football Club Rooms on 14 April.  During the season we paid the balance owing on the No. 5 court and so had five good courts to use.

Hedley Scholz writes a long letter on behalf of the Eudunda Actionist Group of the League of Rights.

[Generally he fears the introduction of a socialist state by the Whitlam Government and a move towards a totalitarian state.  Governments which are elected on the basis of promising the most benefits from the public treasury are inevitably followed by a dictatorship.]

Martin Dunstan writes a letter re his grandfather, John Dunstan and his links with the town.

He enclosed a photo of the Steam Saw Mills in Aberdeen c. 1880 in which John Dunstan was part owner.

John Dunstan was born at Gwenap in Cornwall 4 March 1851 and arrived at Port Adelaide on the Calabar before he was two years old.  With his father and mother and baby brother, he made the trip to Burra in a bullock dray in a fortnight.  After five years Captain Dunstan took over the Whealsara [sic] Copper Mines north of Bundaleer Station.  When a school was established there it was in a dugout in the side of a creek and it was there that John Dunstan learnt spelling and reading in the morning and sewing in the afternoon.  At these mines John Dunstan began picking copper ore when nine or ten years old.  After three years the family moved back to Burra, where John took night school and later attended F.R. White’s Commercial Academy.

[The above is copied from a story he gave the News in 1923.]

He went dispensing for Dr Nutt and then became clerk of the Redruth Court and later book-keeper for Dr T.H. Mayne.  In 1869 he started work with S. Drew & Co. as an accountant and corresponding clerk and stayed for seven years, also acting as clerk for the Burra District Council and auditor later of the Burra Corporation, the Mt Bryan District Council and several mines.

In 1876 he joined forces with G. & W. Sara as timber merchants, builders and contractors.  From practically nothing they built a wonderful business with activities all over the colony.  Among the notable buildings they erected were the Burra Model School, Gladstone Gaol (£21,640), Corny Point Lighthouse, Roseworthy College, the Adelaide Railway Goods Sheds and most of the railway stations on the northern and hills lines.  In a few years the firm was employing 220 men.  After W. Sara retired, the firm continued to prosper as Sara & Dunstan.  John Dunstan also worked on the Black Hills mining venture and was a part owner of the Burra Record.  [Presumably in the period before F.W. Holder gained full control.]

At 30 he was a JP and soon became a Councillor and later Mayor of Burra.  Against strong opposition he instituted tree planting.  With Cr John Lewis he acquired land for a recreation ground with a 999-year lease from the Burra Burra Mines.  He was also a member of the Burra Hospital Board, the Institute Committee and the Burra School Board of Advice.  He joined with Mr Lewis in bringing the Burra children down to Adelaide for the Adelaide Exhibition, against strong opposition.  In this he was assisted by the late W.B. Rounsevell.  The money left over was used to erect the fountain standing near the Anglican Church.

He was also President of the Burra Literary Society.  In 1891 he left Burra for Broken Hill, where he carried out similar works and became Mayor in 1899.

On 1 September 1953 the Record referred to Mr Ben Dunstan of Mt Bryan, who was a brother to John Dunstan.

[Martin Dunstan then goes on to say he is something of a fanatic on scrapbooks – in particular on Willunga and he appeals for any information relevant to that.  He also says he has his grandfather’s writing books, used at the Academy and two framed farewell messages from the town and the Literary Society, that were presented to his grandfather and he offers to lend his family relics for historic occasions in Burra.]

Ian Auhl repeats the report from 15 December 1909 of:

The Grand Balloon Ascent at Burra Oval on 11 December 1909.

Oddly Australia’s first powered flight had been a 5½ second event at Victoria Park, Sydney on 9 December 1909 by Colin de Fris in a Wright bi-plane.  The first balloon flight in SA was from North Terrace in 1871 and in 189o the two sisters Gladys & Val van Tassell had ascended and then returned to earth by triple parachute.  When the article was being researched Ian Auhl asked Mrs Mary Walker, widow of the late Oswald Walker, who was then 90, if she remembered the 1909 event.  She did, clearly, and even recalled that the pilot Rinaldo had landed on a woodheap at Killicoat’s (Abberton Park.)

Viceroy Tea Carnival

A great crowd assembled on Victoria Park on Saturday to witness the balloon ascent arranged by Messrs Wilkinson & Co. of Adelaide as a novel way of advertising their Viceroy Tea.  It created a big sensation.  The inflation of the balloon was watched with great interest.  At the report of a pistol shot, it was released and rose quickly some hundreds of feet, carrying with it Rinaldo, seated comfortably on a trapeze. At the climax he hung by his toes on the fast drifting balloon and then, hanging by his hands, he turned a complete somersault before taking his seat again.  The crowd cheered.  Another pistol shot was the signal for him to drop from the balloon and his body fell towards the earth rapidly, but suddenly a parachute opened and Rinaldo was seen seated on the trapeze, from which he saluted the crowd with a cheery wave of his hand.  Eventually he landed somewhat uncomfortably in P.L. Killicoat’s woodheap at Abberton Park, sustaining a shaking and several cuts, but with his grit and determination undiminished.  W.J. Richardson brought Rinaldo back to Victoria Park in his motor car.

Mid North Tourist Development Association AGM

Chairman D.E. Wilsdon said tourist was Australia’s ninth largest industry and has the fastest growth rate; but if we were complacent the opportunity to benefit would pass us by.  He reported on their Emblem Competition, won by Miss Eunice Mosey and on the ANTA Convention in Sydney.  Moves to amalgamate with the Southern Flinders Indian Pacific Development Association are reported and reasons given why it was decided not to proceed. Attractions which have been developed in the last 12 months are: Rail Tours to Burra, Swaggie Tours, Burra Mines (old & new), Wolta Wolta, Cumberlandvale, Wineries, Geralka Rural Farm, Motel extensions and the National Trust.  He felt Burra was poised to make the most of its attractions with the Copper festival being an encouragement for further developments, but that Clare was ambivalent, with some residents feeling that tourists may upset their already comfortable existence.  Some people in Clare are ready to act on the area’s great potential, but many are prepared to let the opportunity slide.

W.E.D. Young writes re the parachutist who descended into the woodheap at Burra North.  Local boys were so inspired by this that they constructed ‘a parachute’ from canvas, ropes and binder-twine.  The top of O’Leary’s slaughterhouse roof was selected for a take-off point with W.E.D. as the parachutist.  In a cold withering wind he launched himself from about 45 ft and landed in a heap of junk, badly bruised, with a broken jaw and a lacerated tongue.  [William (Bill) Young would have been 11 in December 1909, when the parachutist landed in the woodheap.]

Samin Ltd is presently making copper oxide.  With the commissioning of the Stage II plant at the Mine in the near future this will become the basic ingredient in the making of a premium grade copper sulphate.  This venture links Samin Ltd’s mining resources with the manufacturing and marketing techniques of Adelaide Wallaroo Fertilisers Ltd.  The output, it is understood, will satisfy Australian demand as well as provide a product for overseas. Copper has reached a five-year peak in price, rising from $1,240 per tonne at the start of July to $1,400 10 or 12 days ago.  At the end of 1972 it was $904 per tonne.

The general rate has risen to 1.6 cents in the dollar to bring in $11,720 more.  Rising wages will add $8,000 a year in costs.  New plant is also needed – approval from the Minister will be sought to purchase a new D6 Dozer, 212 Power Grader and Low Loader.  (Hiring out of these will offset the costs and negotiations have already begun for hire of the ‘Dozer’ for work at the Mine.)

Burra Hospital

The new wing is completed internally, with just a few finishing external details to come.  It brings the Hospital into line with some of the best in the state.  The sunroom on the western end will be a useful addition.  In the wards new beds have replaced old and they can be raised and lowered.  Children’s Ward has large observation windows from the corridor.  The whole has been designed to be light and cheerful.  A sunken area alongside the Children’s bath allows a staff member to wash a child without uncomfortable bending.  Several new share rooms have been built.  The staff dining room opens into a small courtyard.  The kitchen is large and modern with stainless steel equipment.  A small room adjacent is provided for Meals on Wheels helpers and communicates with the kitchen through hatches.  Large incinerators have been placed in the old kitchen.

The Labour Ward and its satellite rooms are business-like and can deal with any emergency.  General patients can be placed in unoccupied midwifery wards if it is necessary.  The whole appearance is of hotel-like comfort combined with every consideration of practicality from emergency lighting to the 2,000 gallon rainwater tank beneath the floor and the whole now being on one level makes life much easier for those working there.

Education Symposium.  There was good support from surrounding districts, though local interest was disappointing.  Questions from the floor demonstrated the interest in both remedial reading and individual progression.  The general lack of local support gives little encouragement to organisers.

Burra Hospital.  96th Annual Meeting of the Board of Management

The Chairman said the recent $250,000 improvement made the hospital one of the most up-to-date in country SA.  The financial position improved despite salary increases of some $11,000.  Patient fee increases have resulted in a surplus of $29,547.  The long awaited rebuilding has occurred.  In July the new Maternity Wing, Private and Share Wards, Children’s Ward and new kitchen were taken over and a room has been built for Meals-on-Wheels.  The laundry has been moved to the old kitchen.  Grounds and roadway will be improved and a new retaining wall will be erected around the lawn area.  All kitchen crockery and utensils have been renewed and linen and some furniture.  Costs have been met from our own funds.  The coming year will see painting and renovation to the exterior including the secretary’s residence.  Matron’s residence will get a large sitting-dining room and a carport.  The Nurses’ Home has a new oil heater.  In the past year patients have average 20.1 and 40 babies were born at the hospital.  The hospital has land under crop from Tom Rogers and Don Stockman and would welcome further offers of land from ratepayers.  The Hospital Auxiliary continues to provide welcome assistance under Mrs S. Scroop.  The Burra & District Fund-Raising Committee contributed $1,000 for new furnishings.  Last October Matron Fyfe resigned after 13 years to take effect from 7 December 1972.  She was much involved in the detailed planning of the new hospital.  Matron Phillips was appointed, assisted by Sisters R.Z. Brown, R.M. Lucas, R.B. Seaford, E.A. Oates, J.E. Wall and J. McBride.  Sister I.J. Byles left the district after 10 years of valuable service.  Sister Good has carried out her duties as tutor.  The Secretary-Manager Mr L.H. Packer has kept the administration at a very high level.  The Ambulance Service intends to install a radio base at the hospital.

Mackerode Stud Dispersal Sale will be held at the Burra Stockyards on 17 October 1973.

The stud was established in 1882 by G.A. Gebhardt, beginning with ewes and rams from Sir J. Lancelot Stirling’s ‘Napla’, Lake Alexandrina and from William Jervois’s ‘Wellington’ River Murray.  Later rams were introduced from ‘Koonoona’ and ‘Cappeedee’ and in the early 1900s from NSW, with rams from ‘Boonoke’ and ‘Bundemar’.  The early 1930s saw Collinsville blood introduced and all subsequent breeding has been on Collinsville and Mackerode blood.  In the early years the Mackerode rams were small and wrinkly bodied.  Early 1900s rams cut 30-35 lb of wool with 12 months’ growth.  A difficult task was selecting for wool weight and against body wrinkle.  Wrinkles began to disappear by the 1920s and now rams carry an even three-fold front, with no body wrinkle and little tail wrinkle.  The aim has been for large format, plain bodied sheep carrying a heavy cutting, soft-handling fleece of 58s-60s quality.  Fleece testing has been used in the top 20% of young rams each year to select the best 50% of those tested for potential workers.  Testing has shown that rams with 58-60s on count of crimps per inch usually have a fibre diameter of only 21-23 microns (60-64s) which is an advantage and is a result of breeding for soft-handling wool.

Mackerode ewes have a very high fertility rate.  The stud has been lambing twice a year for some years – half the ewes lamb in autumn and the other half in spring.  Ewes that fail to lamb in spring are culled and the success can be seen in the few that now have to be culled.

The dispersal of such a stud is a rare event and offers breeders a unique opportunity.

Vandalism.  At the Town Hall cabaret on Friday night two doors on the recently erected and not yet quite completed toilets were wrenched from their hinges, ruining the door closers at a cost of $35 each.  One of the glass panels in the door in the foyer was deliberately smashed and cake was trodden into the floor for the full length of the hall and into the foyer.  Such mindless destruction is hard to understand.

Industrial stands were well represented, but less machinery was on display due to the improved rural economy, resulting in less being available.

Bantams were good and there were two very good Muscovy Ducks and a good Rouen Ducks.

Large fowls were down both in numbers and quality.

Pigeons were varied in quality.

Horses in action produced keen competition and the standard was good in hunter events and in hack events.

There was a good show of cut flowers.

Grain entries were disappointing – two main competitors dropped out after 25 years of showing.

Cookery was a credit to the society and entrants.

The dog show was successful.

Good road metal has been fund in the overburden at the Mine and will be stockpiled and made available to the Council.  The normal cost of raising road metal is 20c/yd3.

Council will now borrow $60,000 to purchase new plant: a D6 bulldozer, a low loader tray to transport it and possibly later in the year a new grader.

Rates have been slow in coming in and this has slowed work.  So far $14,000 has come in, mainly from the Town Ward.

The swimming pool was drained some time ago to find the source of a 1,000 gallon a week leak and Councillors are now fairly confident this has been sealed, after a crack across the floor and up one wall was discovered.

Swimming should begin on 1 November as usual.

The family lived in East Street and later in Ayers Street (the house is now Mr Broad’s).  Miss Geake took lessons from Rene Crewes (now Lady McBride) at Kooringa and in 1923 in Adelaide under the late James Ashton.  In 1925 she exhibited an oil painting in Adelaide and won a gold medal.  Paintings sent to London for examination were awarded meritorial certificates.  She taught painting at Kooringa in oil and water colours and also taught the use of pastels and black and white.  Students included Mr L. Bence and the Warner twins from Hallett.  She has always been interested also in needlework, crochet and knitting.  She was a member of the Burra [Cheer-up] Ladies’ Band in WWI, playing the tenor horn. For many years she worked at Wilkinson’s, was connected with the Kooringa Methodist Church and taught at the Sunday school.  We are all pleased to learn that Miss Geake has returned to Burra and wish her well.  The sheaf made by Mrs Lloyd was later delivered to Miss Geake in the Burra Hospital with a card signed by those who came to view her work.

Burra Schools were visited on Friday by representatives of the Education Department and Public Buildings Department to discuss with staff and parent bodies the proposals for the development of the two schools on the present site.  Proposals would involve replacing the accommodation for the High School and upgrading the original building for the Primary School.  Additional facilities would be included, to be used by the school and community groups.  The proposal is expected to go soon to the Public Works Standing Committee, and subject to approval and availability of funds to commence as soon as possible.

The Referendums

Voting in the two referendum questions on Saturday will be compulsory and it will be the first time that the 18-20 year age group will be included.  [Page 6 gives the polling places, which locally were the Burra RSL Hall and the Burra North Court House.]

St Edmund’s Church of England at Booborowie celebrates its golden jubilee on 9 December.  The Bishop of Willochra Rt Rev. S.B. Rosier will preside at Holy Communion and will preach.  The celebrant will be the Rector of Burra Parish, Rev. J.H. Stephenson.  The foundation stone was laid on 5 December 1923 by Mrs A. Affolter, who with a band of helpers provided a large part of the funds needed for the building.  The nave was dedicated on 20 July 1924.  It cost $2,680 and the chancel was added at a cost of $540 in 1928.  The building was consecrated on 8 November 1929.  Before this Anglicans met in Beavan’s homestead at Booborowie for 16 years and from 1921-24 worshiped in the Memorial Hall.  Structural repairs to two places in the nave were made some years ago and a thorough external repainting is now being done.  A large attendance is expected and a basket luncheon will follow the service.  The congregation is now small due to removal after removal of Anglican families from Booborowie.

EFS Officers and others met in the Burra Town Hall on 28 November from Burra, Farrell Flat, Mt Bryan, Hallett, Whyte Yarcowie and Terowie to plan their co-ordinated reaction to fires this season.  They discussed the three divisions of fire fighting:

Field operations

Service to supply the needs of the Fire supervisor

Planning – tactics and operations control

Each Council has at least one EFS station with control rooms and premises suitable for use as a district control centre, bur equally important are trained personnel to staff such centres.

Sgt Haynes cited the problems unique to the Eastern Stations Area.  This area covered 6,871 square miles in which there are 15 occupied homesteads and of which only two have a radio link with the Broken Hill Flying Doctor.  Of the remaining 13, seven are virtually connected to the outside world only by a party-line telephone; three on one line and four on another.  Both lines connect only to the Burra exchange.  The greater part of these lines is old private lines and the majority is carried on mallee posts, often white ant eaten, which would burn like kindling.  Another problem he discussed was the incompatibility of the various radio systems then in use.  Radios capable of DSB, SSB & HF operation were needed.  Sgt Haynes thought Burra was the logical co-ordinating centre.  In the 1951 fire in the Eastern Stations area some units travelled 300 miles chasing smoke and never saw a fire.  There was no co-operation or direction.  Maps have now been prepared at 1 inch to 16 miles, showing all homesteads, occupied and unoccupied and all dams and waterholes and major roads and tracks.  Supervisors should have lists of names, addresses and phone numbers, with particulars of equipment available.

Mr J.N. McBride, Supervisor of the Eastern Districts Fire Fighting Organisation, also addressed the meeting about the present situation and expectations for the fire season.  Negotiation between the two Council areas represented will continue.

St Edmund’s Anglican Church, Booborowie

The golden jubilee celebrations were held on Sunday in prefect weather.  Extra chairs doubled the capacity to 120 or more and a further 60 people had to remain outside and listen on a public address system.  97 people received Holy Communion.  The church has been undergoing restoration for the event.  The painters finished the exterior on Friday morning and the ladies of the church gave it a thorough clean and polish on Friday.  The Tr Rev. S.B. Rosier, Bishop of Willochra, preached.  A luncheon followed in Booborowie Hall.  Former parishioners came back from across the state and members of the local Methodist and catholic congregations also attended.  The Rector, Rev. John Stephenson, welcomed the congregation.

In its early days the congregation met in the home of Mr B.H. Beaven, until the present church was built.  Mrs D.H. Campbell decorated the cake with its 50 candles, which were lit by Mr T. Bailey, a member of the original building committee.  Mrs L. Farrelly, who had been present at the laying of the foundation stone, extinguished the candles.  The collection of $323.37, when put with donations on hand, will make a total of about $700.  Since then the sum has increased to $879.  Repairs and painting may cost about $690, so there will be some over for repainting the interior.

Rainfall goes metric from 1 January 1974.

St Joseph’s Convent, Spalding

A large crowd of 250 old scholars and friends attended a function on Sunday 9 December to mark the closing of the convent.  Rev. Fr Kineary began with Mass at 10.30 a.m.  After the Mass as Angelus was sung by Mr Rod Gill of Victor Harbor, an original scholar in 1921.  Luncheon was then served and some sports run for the children.

Visitors included 27 Nuns and Fathers Laws & Matthews.  Of great interest was a complete roll of scholars 1921-73.

It is a bit sad to think that half the cast, being teachers, have been transferred for 1974.  The event raised $85.70 for Save the Children Fund.

Characteristics of the paper for 1973.

There was a fair coverage of Burra news, but with the service area of the paper extending from Robertstown to Spalding and Saddleworth, quite a bit of space was devoted to news from the other towns in that area.  Errors in setting sports results sometimes make interpreting them difficult or even impossible.

Burra High School Presentation Day (December 1973)

Mr John Halbert, Senior Lecturer in Physical Education at Adelaide Teachers’ College was the guest speaker.

Headmaster D.W. Calder presented the 61st Annual Report.

The year began with 175 students; 100 girls and 75 boys.  In Leaving there were 20 girls and 3 boys.  The prefects have set a fine example and have been conscientious in their duties.  Parent bodies have been co-operative and helpful in enabling the purchase of many sporting and classroom items.  The school canteen proved a great success.  The High School Council has been concerned at the high rate of staff turnover each year; over 50%, and it ahs sought more stability.  It has also been concerned over the standard of school accommodation and the progress of the new school.

St Peter’s Cathedral Choir is coming to Burra again for their annual holiday.  They came three years ago.  They will camp at the Redruth Methodist Memorial Hall, but need three more beds, 12 mattresses and 29 pillows.  If you can help, contact Mr R.R. Reed as soon as possible.  The Choir will lead the singing at St Mary’s for a Confirmation and Holy Communion Service on 27 January, when the Bishop of Willochra, Rt Rev. Bruce Rosier will officiate.

Burra Carols Evening at the Burra Swimming Pool the Sunday before Christmas was the best for years.  Attendance and proceeds were up.  ($67 compared with c. $50 for several years.)  Burra Methodist Choir led the singing.

Burra Rainfall totalled 2,434 point for 1973, which is 670 points above the average.  From 1 January 1974 measurements will be in millimetres (mm).

Weather.  January was the wettest on record with 179.6 mm or 7 inches of rain in a week.  Four days of heavy rain brought floods, but not havoc.  It began late on Saturday night or early Sunday morning and continued to Wednesday evening.  A dry spell on Thursday morning was followed by more rain Thursday afternoon and night and on Friday.  The creeks all flowed strongly.  The whole area of the stockyards and beyond turned into a lake of brown water.  Part of the Copperhouse Road Bridge gave way and became unsafe.  At Gully’s Wharf in Young Street the water came within a foot or so of the top. [Top of what?]  The water roared over the Pig and Whistle crossing, creating a foaming whirlpool.  Fencing was damaged along watercourses throughout the district.  Damage to culverts is extensive, with Springbank Road particularly herd hit.  The Burra Creek crossing at World’s End has also been badly damaged.  The flow down the creek from Springbank to the Bon accord was perhaps the greatest ever.  The total rainfall for January in Burra was 192.4 mm and for the year has reached 224.4 mm or 881 points.

The previous highest rainfall in January was 365 points in 1941.

Burra National Trust AGM

President G.R. O’Connor.  The year has been one of consolidation.  With the aid of three amazing young women from the Salisbury College of Advanced Education the restoration of the dugouts was completed after a long delay.  As a fund raising effort a fence building job was undertaken on behalf of Samin Ltd and resulted in a nett profit of $780.  The Bon Accord residence bathroom was rebuilt and better facilities installed – much of the rebuilding was necessitated by white ant damage – a problem which has re-appeared elsewhere in the house and must be addressed immediately.  The museum continues to be a success and to attract many visitors.

Early in the year an old horse works was purchased and this presents members with the task of making it operative. Three haulage skips in very good repair were also bought and brought to the chimney site.

Due to difficulties associated with mining the area, we have not been able to remove much of the old haulway tunnel, which includes the remarkably preserved wheel.  A serious fault in the rock structure has made the area dangerous.  Roche’s will do their utmost to retrieve as much as possible.  I am concerned that membership remains static.  This is common to most branches, but is nevertheless a concern.

Burra Primary School Council.  Report for 1973 from Ian Allen, Chairman.

Thanks to Mrs Avis Webster and the other women who have made the school canteen such a success.  The Education Symposium on 10 August 1973 was a success, but the Council was disappointed that so few local parents attended; instead attendants came from the surrounding districts and from as far away as Clare and Saddleworth.  Joint finance meetings with the High School have been useful in sharing costs of purchases.  Departmental Heads from Adelaide and representatives of the Primary and High School Councils met on 30 November 1973 concerning the new school and the plans, estimates etc. are now in the hands of the Public Works Standing Committee.  We hope tenders will soon be called.

Miss Tanya Moiseiwitsch visited Burra on Saturday.  She is in the state for the Arts Festival production of Moliere’s The Imaginary Invalid.  Her mother was Miss Daisy Fowler Kennedy who was born in a bedroom of the Commercial Hotel in Burra in 1893.  Joseph Kennedy, Daisy’s father, was a headmaster and the headmaster’s house was not ready, so the family stayed at the hotel until the house in Kangaroo street was available.  Daisy Kennedy became a well known violinist who went to Vienna to study when aged 15.  She later married the famous concert pianist from Odessa, Russia, Benno Moiseiwitsch.

Burra Burra DC

The Local

Government Association is seeking Council feedback on a proposal for quarterly payment of rates.  At present inly about 16% of rates are paid on issue of rates notices.  The rest are not paid till the end of February.  Council has to pay interest on its overdraft and this cost id considerably higher than the accounting cost of quarterly payments.

Spraypave Pty Ltd is sealing the Station Road and the parking area, but has been delayed by bad weather.

Approximately $2,500 has been transferred from the 1st Copper Festival to the Tourist Committee.

Through the generosity of Mrs Andrew Tennant a town clock with two faces has been erected in the lawn area in Commercial St.  [Market Square.]

The stray dog problem in the town has not improved.

Vandals have damaged the toilets at the Council Office, allowing water to run freely overnight on 6 April.

At Burra North cisterns were tampered with and water allowed to run to such an extent that a section of wall has sagged.

Burra’s evidence to the Local Government Boundaries Royal Commission will be taken on Friday.  The submission by the Council was formulated in July 1973 and the Council opposes the formation of Regional Councils on the basis that:

It will mean added costs to ratepayers.

Such a council would carry out the same duties that the present Council does.

There would be unnecessary duplication of work and administrative costs.

The Council can see some merits in bigger Councils in some cases and in boundary adjustments.  This Council was formed five years ago by the amalgamation of the DC and the Corporation of Burra.  Its income is about $100,000 p.a.  It employs a Clerk, Overseer, Part-Time Health and Building Inspectors and combines with two other Councils for a Full-Time Weeds Inspector.  There is a concern over rising costs of maintenance and administration and it feels its boundaries should not be retracted.  In the event of a decision that some adjacent Councils should cease to exist, a map is enclosed showing the area that could be incorporated into the Burra Burra DC.

Burra Floods

Thunderstorms on Tuesday evening brought 24.8 mm in less than one hour.  On Saturday came a heavier downpour.  Outlets were unable to cope and some minor flooding of streets occurred.  At about 1 p.m. the creek past the hospital overflowed at the Commercial Road Bridge.  Commercial Street was rapidly covered in muddy water, which flooded parts of Chapel, Queen and Thames Streets.  Some Commercial Street premises were flooded and others escaped.  The rainfall for the week was 68.8 mm.  The rainfall for April so far is 164.6 mm or 650 points and the highest ever was in 1889 when 830 points were recorded.

It is also near the town centre and will preserve the close relationships of the school with the community and give ready access to the Burra Town Swimming Pool and football oval.  The school will be able to offer facilities for the community in terms of the library and art and craft and music facilities and a multi-purpose sports hall.  It is envisaged that the school will become a focal point for educational, recreational and cultural interests.  There will be a staff block, administration, canteen, sports, music & drama areas and changing rooms as well as a library, recreation areas and car park.  Parents will have a continuity of involvement as their children move through the school from primary to secondary years.  There is the possibility of a unified administration under a single headmaster.

The size of the planned accommodation has been based on primary enrolments in Burra and district schools.  Secondary enrolments should exceed 200 by 1975, which justifies providing for 220-250 students, which would allow for the possibility of a 5th year class in the future.  The existing Burra School is a well-known landmark and is among the finest buildings of its type in SA.  It has, however, outlived its usefulness for modern educational conditions and needs extensive modifications to meet the requirements of modern educational programs.  The large rooms with high ceilings are hard to heat and cool and also present acoustic problems.  Little has been done in recent years to modify the original accommodation.  Administration facilities are inadequate.  The library is far below modern standards and the classrooms do not accommodate modern teaching methods.

The site has made development difficult and the outdoor areas fall far short of requirements.  Sports facilities are limited and in need of upgrading and development.  The site has also become cluttered by the erection of a multitude of wooden classrooms, a canteen and toilet blocks for both schools.  Many of these buildings have outlived their economic usefulness.  The plans prepared provide for upgrading of the main building to house a primary school of 350 in modern open-space accommodation.  This provision anticipates the eventual closure of Leighton (28 children), Farrell Flat (17 children) and Mt Bryan (36 children).  The plan groups buildings around a central courtyard at the rear of the old building and they are functionally linked by the resource centre, while the existing building will be extensively remodelled internally.  Planning and design is based on the open space principle.  All new buildings are single storey and are stepped up the rising ground so as not to distract from the appearance of the existing building, especially as seen from the town.  The relationships of the buildings and their uses allow for the separation or integration of the two schools as required.

Weather.  With 23.2 mm to 9 a.m. yesterday and 81.0 mm for the week, the January-May period becomes the wettest on record; 508.6 mm or 20.02 inches.  The previous highest was in 1889 with 13.41 inches.  The continuously flowing water courses and flooding have made access to many paddocks virtually impossible.  Many gutters have become creeks and shallow creeks have been deepened.

The Burra Creek yesterday was a rushing torrent of muddy water for the sixth time this year.  Mt Bryan was flooded again on Thursday; the earth is so saturated that it cannot absorb even a slight shower.

Further rain has fallen, with 94 points to 1.30 p.m.

Obituary.  Allan Donald Sellars died 12 March. He has been described as ‘a friend to all who had the pleasure of knowing him’.  He was born at Burra North in 1908 and educated at the Burra School.  He married Daphne Hirschausen in 1927 and together they commenced and operated a general carrying, grain agency and wood merchant’s business.  From the mid 1930s Mr Sellars conducted a mail run for six years, travelling each weekend to the outlying stations east of Burra, covering a distance of 300 miles over unmade roads, with some 180 rates to negotiate.  Declared unfit for war service, he opened a service station and garage in conjunction with his other business to release the owner for war service.  On medical advice he gave up his business and purchased ‘Emu Flat’ at Keith in 1945.  This proved unsuitable for family needs at the time and he then spent six years on dairy farms at Murray Bridge and Jervois before returning to Keith in 1953.  In 1958 he founded the General Agency business of A.D. Sellars & Sons – later including all six sons in premises at Keith.  Ill health forced him into semi-retirement in 1966.  He was always interested in the community and was the founder of the ‘Burdett’ Agricultural Bureau at Murray Bridge.  He was a director of the Jervois Co-op Milk Factory and assisted in getting it included in the city milk area, thereby receiving extra bonuses.  He was on the committees of the Keith Agricultural Bureau, Keith War Memorial Community Centre and the Keith & District Show Society.  He was of a cheerful disposition and ever ready to help his fellowman.  He is survived by his daughter, Roma Mrs C.A. Davis and sons, Colin, Brian, Graham, Dean, Ian and Kevin.

Mr Wal. Martin married Mrs Joyce Bourman, well known in Burra.

[Her first husband, Leonard Bourman, has died in 1971.]

Pam & Barry Biggs have left Burra after nine years here to open a shop ‘The Gem Cave’ in Alice Springs.

Father John Morley was born in 1924 and lived with his family on a small orchard and vineyard at Williamstown.  The family moved to Adelaide in the 1930s and John attended Urrbrae Agricultural HS and Pulteney Grammar School.  After school he went jackerooing for Mr Chris Wade on Thistle Island for a year, before working for Sir Philip McBride on Conmurray Station in the South East.  He joined the RAAF as air crew in 1942 and was commissioned in 1943, eventually becoming Radar Leader for 102 Squadron, flying in Liberators.  After discharge he returned to Conmurray for a time and in 1946 bought a virgin property on the Avenue Range, which he named ‘Dingley’.   He developed 1,300 acres before selling it in 1957.  He ran 1,500 to 2,000 sheep and Aberdeen Angus cattle.  He studied for the ministry at St John’s College, Morpeth, from 1958 for three years.  He has been a keen sportsman, playing football and cricket for more than 20 years and now plays golf and a little tennis.  He used to show horses in the South East and also played polocrosse.  He is married with three children and three grandsons.  His son, John, is married and works at G.H. Michell & Sons.  Rosemary is married and Susan is still at school at Woodlands, doing matriculation this year.

Hanson Post Office was closed on Friday after serving the community for 84 years.  Hanson will now be served by private boxes at Burra or Farrell Flat or by the Mail Run.  Hanson was a non-official office.  The first office was at the Hanson (then called Davieston) Railway Station and was opened in December 1890.  Mr I. Rippin was the postmaster with a daily mail service by train.  E.S. Blunt was postmaster 1897-1902.  A telegraph worked by telephone was installed in 1913.  Local residents built the next post office by the schoolteacher’s residence and until 1947 postmasters were the schoolteacher’s wives or immediate relations.  E. Dawson was the schoolteacher in 1915, Hester Oakley was schoolteacher 5 January 1916 and Miss Janie H. Fedd from 1 July 1916 was the sister of the schoolmistress.  Lilian Mabel Bishop was a temporary appointment 25 March 1920 and Margaret Ellen Marshall was the teacher from 15 April 1920.

Allison Barckey, an exchange student from Riverton, New Jersey, who is at Burra High School and staying with John & Bev. Dewhirst at Booborowie, makes some observations:

At home we learn to be more independent and here the teachers outline what is important.  At home we are given more assorted material and each must judge for himself or herself what is important.  At home I go to a private co-ed school drawn from a select group of the community.  At BHS there is a wider range and variety of people.  At home it is usual to change rooms and class levels for every class.  Here there seems to be little academic pressure among fellow students.  Living in the country is different too.  The atmosphere is relaxed, but with a quiet air of growth and change.  It has all been very fascinating and exciting and I cannot discover all I would like in my ten week stay.

Burra Burra DC, last Tuesday

A meeting of ratepayers has been called to consider the Council’s options in the face of large wage increases and rising overhead costs.  The question of lining the Burra Swimming Pool with fibreglass will have to be considered.  It removes the need for repainting every year and resists the growth of algae.

At the last meeting of Council on Tuesday Cr W. Brown was re-elected Chairman with Cr R.J. Jeffery as Deputy Chairman.

Commonwealth and State Governments are presently refusing to indicate whether grants are available for unsealed main roads and this is a serious worry.  There is a call to generally brighten up the town’s appearance prior to the Copper Festival; removal of weeds and action with the paint brush is recommended.

The Royal Commission on Council Boundaries

The first report recommends reducing the number of Councils from 137 to 72 with boundaries based on community of interest.  The recommendation does not envisage there being fewer officers employed.  In the last 40 years almost all the changes have been the amalgamation of a rural Town Council with surrounding District Council.  Very few boundary changes have been made.  The mergers of Town Councils and District Councils have all proved to be satisfactory.  [Details are given respecting the District Councils of Robertstown and Eudunda, which it is proposed to merge and also the District Council of Saddleworth & Auburn, which it is proposed to merge with the DC of Riverton and of the Clare DC, which it is recommended should be enlarged by absorbing parts of the DCs of Georgetown & Spalding together with all of Blyth.]

The Burra Burrs DC and the Clare DC boundary would remain as it is, but it is recommended that the southern three Hundreds of the Hallett DC (Anne, Hallett & Tomkinson) be merged with the Burra Burra DC.  The Burra Burrs DC has not yet had time to consider this recommendation.

Weather.  Further rain amounting to 17.2 mm has brought the annual total to 689.9 mm or 2,715 points.  This is approaching the annual record of 2,780 points in 1889.

Premier Don Dunstan will come to Burra during the Copper festival in October.

Burra & District Ratepayers’ Meeting on Thursday night was well attended.  The main concerns expressed covered road deterioration and the lack of grant monies.  A petition to the Minister of Roads, followed by a deputation is to be arranged.  The Chairman said there have been many changes and proposals for change in local government in the past year and this has created a rather confused outlook.  At the start of the year the Council was in a difficult financial position, though this had improved somewhat now.  The Council has had to increase staff since January 1973 due to the increased complexity of its work.  In the year Rural Unemployment Relief Grant work was completed, resulting in improved recreational facilities at Farrell Flat, Booborowie, mount Bryan and Burra.  Some renovation of Paxton Square and the Redruth Gaol was also done.  A smoke lounge and toilets were constructed at the Burra Town Hall.  Council administration includes Town Hall hire and management, caravan park maintenance, Burra Swimming Pool maintenance and management and two sports grounds at Burra.  The projected plan for a dam on Burra Creek has been delayed by weather conditions, but is expected to proceed in early summer.  Councillors continue to promote the development of the town and district.  Rising costs will be a major factor in the coming year.  The EFS has attended several small fires this year.  A main theme to appear during the meeting was the deterioration of unsealed roads and some sealed sections within the district.  The Booborowie-Spalding Road attracted a lot of comment.  The Minister says he is going to look at the matter of road funding, but comes back with a negative result.  There seems to be no alternative, but to cut Council costs.  Perhaps we must cut staff and rely on outside contractors if and when money becomes available.  The petition and deputation will stress the need for road funds, the threat of retrenchment to Council staff and the need for a higher priority to be given to the Booborowie-Spalding Road.

The possible control of water sports on Porter’s Lagoon was also raised and a meeting will be called to discuss this further.  At present six fences have been covered by water in the lagoon areas.  Weed control was another issue that received some attention.

Burra Burra DC

The rate has been increased by 0.2 cents in the dollar, but the extra $11,700 in revenue will not solve the Council’s financial problems and if Government aid does not increase then retrenchment of the workforce will have to be undertaken.  The attitude of the Federal Government is particularly deplorable.  Through traffic from the eastern states is considerable and the wet year has also increased the damage to surfaces.  Burra has been changed from a zoning of Region 8 to Region 7, to its detriment and is seeking reinstatement.  Council has decided to accept the boundary changes as recommended by the Local Government Royal Commission.  There has been no real progress on the common effluent drainage system pending a decision whether the Government will provide the necessary subsidy.

Porter’s Lagoon

A Progress Committee was formed at a meeting at Farrell Flat Hall on 12 August.  Mr Leo Robinson of Burra chaired the meeting and was later elected President of the new Porter’s Lagoon Progress Committee.  The Vice-President is Gordon Webster.  The aim is to promote water safety for swimmers, skiers and boat owners.  Boat owners will be asked to pay a $2 membership fee to the committee which will control the foreshore.

Locusts and Grasshoppers were around in large numbers last April-May.  Locust hatchings are expected in September and indications are that this could be a bad year.  A state-wide control program is being organised.

Weather.  A further 140 points or 35.4 mm of rain for august has made 1974 the wettest year on record since figures began in 1880.  So far the total is 28.27 inches compared with the previous highest of 27.86 in 1889.

Mr B. Gollin started a humble shop in Burra in 1850 and in 1974 Gollin Holdings Ltd is a business with an annual turnover exceeding $134 million.  The Advertiser of 8 December 1874 reported the death of Mr B. Gollin at an early hour on Monday.  [Bezaleel Gollin died 7 December 1874 Adelaide.]  He had been suffering from a complaint requiring great care for some time, but it had not prevented his continued business dealings.  On Sunday he felt unwell and about 11 a.m. he lay down.  When he was seized with great pain a doctor was sent for and he died at 2 a.m. on Monday morning.  He had been in business in a big way for many years in Burra and Adelaide.  He was a successful broker and played a prominent part in the affairs of the Synagogue.  He left a widow and a large family of sons and daughters.  The Australian International Trading Company that started in Adelaide 125 years ago has commissioned the author Osmar White to write its history.

Gollin Holdings traces its origins to the arrival of Bezaliel Gollin in Adelaide in 1848.  He is first recorded as a store owner in Burra in 1850 and when he died in 1874 was said to be a commercial broker in business in a large way.  His sons George and Walter expanded the operations and in partnership with two cousins had branches in NZ, Sydney and Melbourne by 1900.  They were largely involved in importing foodstuffs, textiles and raw materials and in a902 opened a London purchasing centre.  When George Gollin died in 1946 he bequeathed $20,000 to establish the George Gollin Professorship of Economics at Adelaide University.  The early days remain very sketchy and Mr White will visit Burra this week on Thursday.

Burra Burra Hospital Board

Cr R.B. Jennison has retired after 16 years service to the Board and Mr L.A. Beinke was appointed in his place.  Chairman R.K. Pearce delivered the 97th Annual Report.  This year had been very successful financially.  Reserves had been built up sufficiently to enable the alterations to the hospital to be made without a public appeal.  They cost $253,926 of which $169,225 was Government subsidy.  Expenses have been controlled.  Wages have risen $18,787 and a corresponding increase in fees of $50,716.  It is likely wages in the coming year will be $150,000.  The average bed cost rose $1.11 to $17.40, but we still showed a surplus of $26,617 and there is a credit balance in all accounts of $30,000 on deposit.  The building program for now is complete.  We have a new Maternity Wing including an Emergency Labour Ward, store rooms, Children’s Ward and kitchen and this brings the hospital to a high standard.  The laundry and incinerator rooms have been modernised.  Nearly all the rooms and passageways are now air conditioned and the other parts of the hospital and the Matron’s and Secretary’s residences have been renovated and painted.  Gardens and Lawns have been re-sown.  In the next year we will bituminise the car park and erect a car park for nursing staff.  The Secretary’s residence will be renovated inside.  This will only leave the painting of the old private rooms and wards to be done.  A new X-ray plant has been purchased for $4,600.  Daily occupancy is 24 and 33 babies were born.  The Hospital Auxiliary continues its important support.  The Burra 7 District Fund Raising Committee this year donated $1,000.  Matron Phillips has been quietly efficient.  Sister Good has been an able Tutor Sister.  The Meals On Wheels continues to carry on with great success.

Bezaliel Gollin – information from Ian Auhl.

Gollin seems to have arrived in Burra in 1848 and joined the firm of Marks, very early storekeepers in Burra.  The firm became Marks & Gollin.  Gollin appears as foreman of nearly every court case from 1848 to 1851, including a murder or two.  The Register reports Queen Victoria’s 31st birthday when Gollin hoisted the City of London banner from his flagpole and soon flags were flying everywhere in honour of the sovereign.  On the 1849 map Mr White noticed Marks and Gollin on a couple of blocks.  Mr Marks lived between Kangaroo and Ware Streets where the Walkleys now live.  Bezaliel Gollin lived on a block on Ayers Street where Les Broad & family now reside.

Osmar White, the author who visited Burra recently researching the history of Bezaliel Gollin, considers that Burra has by far the best collection of mid-Victorian buildings in the whole of Australia.  He cannot understand why they are not being exploited.  There should, he says, be hundreds of thousands of tourists annually.  A tumbledown stone cottage could produce more wealth for the community than any modern shop or service station that could be erected on its site.  People may consider that history is bunt – ‘but these days it’s gilt edged bunt and it brings the money into communities with the common sense to cash in on an historical heritage.’

[Check this use of ‘bunt’.  If it is noted correctly, it is probably an incorrect reference to Henry Ford’s famous comment ‘History is more or less bunk.’  This was said in an interview with Charles N. Wheeler and reported in the Chicago Tribune 25 May 1916.]

Unless summer rains come it will be a tinderbox.

Luncheon was served in the shearers’ quarters and the meeting was held in the woolshed.  John McBride was Chairman & Supervisor of the Organisation.  The main visitor was the Director General of the EFS Mr Fred Kerr.  The Chairman’s report stressed the tremendous growth of this exceptional season and its potential to make the east the most fire prone district in the state.  He suggested the need again for the area to be declared a total fire ban area.  He outlined the negotiations which resulted in their having four radio transmitting licences for Single Side Band Receivers on a call sign VL5EM, but at present, while awaiting delivery; they were using the radio on loan from the Traeger Company.  He also reported on his visits to other allied organisations at Mannahill and Gladstone.  The problem of plague locust hatchings was also referred to.  Mr McBride declined to continue in office and Mr Don Lord was elected in his place.  Mr Kerr then gave his address.  Mr Brian Menadue, a police officer, also spoke and said the pilots who flew to Moomba six days a week would be actively looking for fires.

Obituary.  Monsignor Patrick Valentine Hughes died on 18 September.  After his retirement he lived at Port Pirie for a year with the Bishop, before moving to ‘Villa Beovich’ at Myrtle Bank, a new home for retired priests conducted by the Little Sisters of the Poor.  The funeral was at Burra on Friday at 11 a.m. when Bishop Gallagher of Port Pirie was the Principal Celebrant at the Requiem Mass, assisted by Father Kevin Matthews of Burra, Mons. Thomas Horgan, Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Adelaide and twenty-eight priests.  Place of honour was given to Archbishop Beovich of Adelaide, who studied in Rome with Monsignor Hughes.  Friends came from Renmark and Barmera where he had been Parish Priest as well as from elsewhere in SA.  He was a gentle and frugal man with a great zeal for his faith and a love for children.  He was born in 1891 and educated at St Augustine’s Geelong, Victoria, Mt Melleray Seminary, Ireland and at the Propaganda Fide College in Rome.  After ordination in Rome by Cardinal Pompili in 1926 he went to SA and the then Diocese of Port Augusta.  He served as assistant priest in Peterborough, Port Augusta and Port Pirie and was locum tenens at Carrieton before becoming Parish Priest at Renmark and later at Burra, where he was a familiar and respected figure until his retirement several years ago.

Retiring President, Don Kempster, reported on a year where the main concerns had been the result of high rainfall causing the need for more mowing and soft ground preventing the use of the tractor.  Improvements were made to numbers 1, 2 & 11 holes.  Later in the season the combined 9th and 11th elevated tee-off was formed.

St Joseph’s Catholic Church Centenary

Bishop Brian Gallagher of Port Pirie consecrated St Joseph’s Burra exactly 100 years from the day it was officially blessed and opened on 8 November.  The celebrations continued over the weekend.

On Friday the church was consecrated.

On Saturday there was a special Mass of thanksgiving and a Parish Picnic at Aberdeen Oval.

Seventeen priests from the Diocese of Port Pirie and the Archdiocese of Adelaide attended the consecration ceremony.  One was Monsignor W.H. Nesdale who was parish priest of Burra 52 years ago and is still active as Parish Priest of Georgetown.  Monsignor T. Toal of Jamestown is a brother to Dr M.F. Toal, who was a former Burra priest.  Fr Laurie Quinn came from Loxton.  Fr M. Kineavy, the priest previous to Fr Kevin Matthews, was also present [and the other visiting priests are listed.]

Two aspects of the consecration of interest were the taking possession of the church and the sealing of relics into the altar.  In taking possession the Bishop wrote the Greek and Latin alphabets in sand spread in the centre of the church.  The idea is that Christ’s possession of the church can be so symbolised, as he is the beginning and end of all things, the alpha and omega or in the Latin alphabet the A and Z.  The relics of saints are enclosed in every consecrated altar.  The new altar was consecrated and then Mass was celebrated.  The Altar, Lectern, President’s Seat and Tabernacle Stand have all recently been constructed from local stones, copper ore, pieces of malachite and azurite, to give a typical local flavour.  The design is the work of Fr Kevin Matthews and was done by David Loffler with Fr Matthews as labourer.  Ross Drew and Mike Warde laid the new carpet over the extended sanctuary and the candlesticks on the walls were made and donated by Darius Ross of Ross Lighting in Adelaide.  Ross and Dianne Drew presented a cushion for the seat to match the new carpet.  After the consecration there was a reception in the Town Hall.  Mr Jim Quinn, as Master of Ceremonies, gave a brief summary of the early history of the parish.  He pointed out the connections with the Austrian Jesuits who founded Sevenhill and the early foundation of a church-school in Commercial Street in 1857.  The ruins can be seen on the corner of Kangaroo Street.  He mentioned the great work of the Sisters of St Joseph and others over so many years.  Bishop Gallagher responded and pointed out that owing to the illness of one of the priests Fr Matthew would now also have responsibility for the Parish of Spalding-Booborowie as well as Burra.

Fr John Morley of St Mary’s [Anglican] Parish spoke on behalf of local clergy.

On Saturday evening St Joseph’s was filled again for a Mass of Thanksgiving.

On Sunday a Parish Picnic was held at Aberdeen Oval and an altar had been erected there for an open air Mass, celebrated by Fr Matthews.  Special mention was made of Brother Shutz [sic] SDB, an old identity of Burra and Sister Helen, who had taught at St Joseph’s School for many years.  John Fahey of Hallett, with the help of others, conducted a program of sports and competitions for children and parents.

Obituary. One of Spalding’s oldest residents Mrs Elizabeth Ann McAvaney died in Clare Hospital on 23 September aged 82.  She was a daughter of the late Mr & Mrs Robert Lister and was born in Redhill in 1892 and began her schooling at the Collinsville School.  She married Thomas Vincent McAvaney at St Mary’s Cathedral Port Pirie in 1913.  They lived at Broken Hill for two years before moving to Spalding.  She was a zealous worker for her church and a member of the Red Cross, CWA and Senior Citizens Club.  She is survived by two sons; Reg. (Adelaide) and Geoff. (Spalding).  There are 8 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.

[Born Elizabeth Ann Lister 12 October 1891 Collinsfield.  Since Collinsfield was located 8 km south of Redhill, the reference above to Collinsville is likely a mistake for Collinsfield.]

$100,000 in outstanding rates is overdue.  Of the district’s 1,600 ratepayers only 400 have paid their rates and of those the majority are from the town of Burra.  Carrying the burden of unpaid rates for eight months of the year means that much work does not get done.  Main roads get work from Government Grants.  Local roads must wait for rate payment.

Obituary.  Philip Bampton aged 73 was buried at Holy Cross Church, Goodwood, on 4 November.  Mr Bampton and his wife and family – Basil, Isabelle (Mrs Jim Hasse), Anne and Derek – came to Burra from India in the early 1950s.  They worked for St Joseph’s Church and Anne and Derek attended the Convent School.  His brother, Dr Bampton and his wife and family followed them, but Dr Bampton died soon after arriving.  The first of Mrs Bampton’s relatives to come to Burra in the late 1940s were the gentle Mr & Mrs Jim Elder (hairdressers at Burra and Burra North) and their parents, Mr & Mrs McKenna Senior and Eric, who were in business here before moving to their successful antique business on Unley Road.  (Jim Elder Jnr is also an antique dealer in North Adelaide.)  All these people will be remembered for their refinement and love of life. The change of life style from India to Burra could not have been an easy one, but Philip Bampton was sad when he left Burra to live in Elizabeth North.  He cycled around Burra & Burra North daily for many years as the postal delivery man.

Burra Apex Club will induct six new members on Thursday 28 November.  John Madigan, Zone Representative of the Association of Apex Clubs will come to Burra for the occasion and so will Roger Dixon of the Barossa Valley Apex Club.  The six new members will be Carey Noack, Geoff Schwier, Mike & Andrew Scholz, Jeff Thomas and Andrew Anderson.  Burra President Trevor Blatchford said Burra now had 22 members.

The Australia-wide project for 1973-74 had been Foundation 41; a project organised by Dr William McBride for research into birth deformities.  Burra Apex had raised $300 for this.  The 1974-75 project focuses on Multiple Sclerosis.  Locally Apex had assisted the Copper festival with the production of ‘Copper Crunch’ Burra’s answer to ‘Mad’ Magazine.  Members had also manned the Information Booth.  They also staged a Gymkhana on 15 September.  Apex will erect new tourist signs when they arrive.  A gas barbecue for visitors is a project being considered.  Burning excess grass within the town is another project.  A restored hay wagon for the kindergarten is also being installed – donated by Ron Pearse of Koonoona.  Apex runs the films at the Town Hall.  Despite all these activities some people are not satisfied.

[A comment near the start of the article suggests there was some adverse criticism of Apex around the town at this time.]

Burra CWA held its 49th birthday and International Day last Thursday.  The country featured this year was Australia and Mrs L. Bence gave her insights as one who came to Australia from Britain.  Mrs E. Baulderstone made the cake, which was iced by Mrs M. Cox.

Community Teaching Comes to Burra.  Recently introduced electives have introduced the idea of community teaching on a small scale with parents coming into the school to teach and children going into the community (garages) to learn.

Burra Burra DC

Rate payments of an additional $33,000 to the $20,000 already received have been a welcome response to the Council’s concerns expressed recently, but $70,000 is still outstanding.  Samin has paid $729.90 in royalties under the Old Mining Act.  This covers ore used in the pilot operation in 1971 and to the end of June 1972.

There is now a new Act, but monies due under that have not yet appeared.

It is anticipated that Power Industrial Cleaning Services will have cleaned the pool surface for the application of fibreglass by tomorrow, but Christmas and New Year Holidays mean no further work will be done till 6 January when men from Combo Industries will begin applying fibreglass.  They hope to finish on 10 January and water can then be added to the pool.  Other renovation work will also be done between now and then.  Over 30 panes of glass have been broken in the changing room by vandals.  Filtering of the water will take about a week, so the pool should open somewhere about 17 January.  Tenders have been called for the purchase of the Council’s 1967 Bedford tip truck.

Site inspections have been made for a new netball court at the War Memorial Oval.  It is hoped to have it ready for the 1975 season.

Characteristics of the 1974 paper.

There was not a very comprehensive news coverage of Burra.  Sports get a reasonable coverage and reports from many societies’ AGMs are frequent, but anything actually written by the paper itself is sparse and often inadequate.  The reports on the two floods in Burra for the year are typical of this, being quite brief and lacking in detail.  Even the ‘Out & About’ column is less comprehensive than in earlier years.  There are many articles that act as ‘fillers’ and many items of general interest (particularly to primary producers), but also fillers giving hints to the handyman (on painting for instance).

After page 1 the layout of the paper varied from week to week, but the following outline is quite typical.

Page 1	Typically full of news, but frequently little of it relating to Burra.

Page 2	Large advertisements and sports.

Page 3	Large advertisements – typically more than half page – plus public notices and sports.

Page 4	Large advertisements and a mixture of sports, news and articles of general interest.

Page 5	Advertisements with some news and general interest items.

Page 6	Large advertisements, the cash column, public notices and entertainment.

Page 7	The ‘Out & About’ column with large advertisements and a small amount of sports or other items of general interest.

Page 8	The 50 Years Ago column and items of general interest.

Burra Swimming Pool

The pool has now been fibre-glassed, renovated and filled.  It will open on Tuesday or earlier depending on the cleaning of the water.

The Council is concerned with the untidy appearance of the town caused by blocks littered with weeds and rubbish and especially with derelict car bodies.  Council is to make an effort in the next twelve months to eliminate unsightly areas of weeds and rubbish.

Children riding bikes on footpaths are seen as posing a hazard for pedestrians.

Prosecutions for straying sheep are expected soon.

The swimming pool renovation has now been successfully completed and it has since been well patronised.

The ratepayers’ meeting on 10 February drew a representative gathering.  A resolution was passed approving the lease of a site for the planned new club house.  The procedure of the club borrowing money through the Council can now go ahead.

Over twelve months ago the Council received a loan of $7,000 for the purpose of constructing a dam across the Burra Creek.  The questions of possible flooding and of pollution have been taken into account by the E & WS Department and work has now been started on creating a shallow lake stretching from the Caravan Park to just north of the Burra Hotel.  Pumping from the Mine is expected to begin soon at the rate of about 2 million gallons per day.  The dam should be an attractive addition to the beauty of the town.

Following a deputation to the Minister of health it seems that the Burra Common Effluent Drainage Scheme will be constructed in 1976-77.

The Grants Commission has invited applications for funding to upgrade sports facilities.

BHS.  The year began with 172 students, slightly down on 1974 due to fewer 1st year students.  A new staff member Mr Colin Baker was welcomed.  Art teacher Mrs Schultz is unfortunately still on sick leave.  From now on year levels will be referred to as Grades VIII, IX etc.

Obituary.  Hartley Harris, formerly of Burra, died in Melbourne 9 February aged 84.  He was a son of the late Frank Harris and left Burra in 1923, keeping up a subscription to the Burra Record ever since.  His first job about seventy years ago was with the Burra Record at 5/- a week.  After two years he went to Adelaide and entered the grocery trade.  In the Great War he saw service at Gallipoli and in France, after which he married and returned to Burra to be employed as a grocer by Drew & Crewes.  In 1923 he went to Lilydale in Victoria to an apple orchard and dairy farm.  With difficult times and the onset of the Great Depression he returned to grocery, where he remained until he retired.  For the last 25 years he lived in the Melbourne suburb of Reservoir.  He is survived by his son Bruce and his brother Arthur, now of Adelaide.  He spent his last three months at the McLeod Repatriation Hospital.  The occupant of an adjacent bed was another man who spent his early years in Burra; Mr Peter Gebhardt.  [Hartley Pascoe Harris born 10 August 1890 Kooringa.

Peter Gebhardt would seem likely to have been Adolph Peter Gebhardt born 30 September 1905 at Port Wakefield, though if he was at a Repatriation Hospital it suggests he was a WWII veteran.]

$17,000 more is required to erect three more units.  The cost of the three units is now $70,000.  Government subsidy will bring in $37,000, but only if all the necessary money is in hand before work starts.  Cash in hand is $19,000, leaving a shortfall of $17,000 to be raised.  The proposed units will be the same standard as the existing ones.  The No. 6 Social Club (Masonic) has also handed $657 to the appeal as the result of Friday night’s cabaret.  The hotels of the district have all made generous donations, as have Moyles, Coca Cola Bottlers, Snack foods Pty Ltd and Jackie Kleinig’s Dance Band.

Warnes; Senior Vice-President, Neil Hurst; Junior Vice-President, Peter Stockman and Secretary-Treasurer, Darrell H. Field (re-elected).  The society was in credit $122.50 after having new toilet facilities erected.  The toilet project was made possible in large part due to the Rural Youth, who ran a Lottery Cabaret to assist.  D.T. Jacka & Co. erected the new toilets.

The show was held on the Saturday of the October long weekend and coincided with the Burra Copper Festival.  As a result gate takings were a near record.  Mr Bert Kelly MHR opened the show.  The day began with showers, but cleared as the day progressed.  Entries were good in most sections.  More entries in shearing would be appreciated.  Miss show Girl was a huge success.  The Dog Section was not held for lack of a convenor.  A pony club has been formed in Burra in the past year and has been given permission to use the grounds.

Tennis.  With so many tennis players in town there is a shortage of courts.  There are eight senior and two junior teams and at times local teams with scheduled home matches have to play away; for example at Leighton.  Five courts are available at Burra North as well as those at the school.  Planned building operations at the school are likely to deprive players of the use of four of these.  It is planned therefore to lay down six courts on the area of the former lawn courts.  An application has been made to the State Committee of Regional Employment Development for $13,000 to cover the cost and for two netball courts – one at Aberdeen Oval and one at Burra War Memorial Oval.  With the building of the new clubhouse for the Burra Golf Club the present clubhouse will meet the needs of tennis players.

Burra Golf Club has decided to sign the contract with D.T. Jacka & Co. for the new clubhouse.

Football.  The season starts on 26 April.  In the Mid North League it is understood that Auburn has now amalgamated with the Watchman Football Club for 1975 and many players will play in the Adelaide Plains Association.

Stockowners Association of SA.  The Burra & District Committee held its annual meeting in the RSL Hall and elected: President, J.G. Duncan; Senior Vice-President, J.T. Drew; Junior Vice-President, R.J. Ashby.  The address was given by M.I. McTaggart.  The President reported on the year’s activities.

The wool sales in September saw values slide a further 15-17½% with the average bale fetching $176 at the last sale – a slight improvement.  There was a year of record rainfall resulting in huge losses in pastoral areas due to blowfly attacks and more recently from grass seeds and worms.  Some producers say this combination has been more worry than a drought.  The bushfire hazard has been extreme.

Cattle prices have been low, but stable and with an estimated backlog of 2 million cattle to be slaughtered, the outlook is grim.

Pig meat and grain fed lamb prices have been quite good.

Rising costs in the sector in wages, workers’ compensation, fuel, payroll tax, super bounty and depreciation, along with depressed markets are forcing producers to the wall.

He asked that clearance of players to take positions with other clubs be expedited.  The Mid North League will now have five rounds of matches with no byes.  Mr Bannear felt that this could well be the last year of the Mid North League, with every possibility of joining with the North Eastern League in 1976.

E.C. Allen MP Member for Frome objects to plans to close all polling booths with under 50 voters average in the last three elections.  Places affected around Burra would be Black Springs av. 46.  [Though how 54, 48 & 51 averages 46 is not explained!]  Also Bright (41), Hanson (40) and Willalo (50).  His complaint is not so much about closures in the settled areas as the effect in more remote locations.  The result would be only one booth in the whole area north-east of Peterborough; at Yunta.  In the far north, if Oodnadatta closed (50) the nearest booth would be Marree 274 miles away.  With mail deliveries once a fortnight postal votes are also not an option in such remote areas.  The system would have to be changed.

Mrs Margaret Goyder Kerr of Somerton Park writes seeking information on the life of James and John Chambers who came to SA in 1837 and who pioneered postal and coaching services in SA.  They also took up vast areas of land for cattle and sheep and went in for breeding horses.  With William Finke they discovered copper on their Oratunga station.  They employed John McDouall Stuart to move further into then unknown territory.  They were among the founders of Adelaide’s early hunt and racing clubs.  Their sister Priscilla married the adventurous Alfred Barker, who came to SA with Colonel Light before the colony was founded.

Obituary.  Mary Williams was the fourth daughter of the late Charles and Elizabeth Evans of Riverton.  The family of five daughters was cared for by their kindly father after Mary’s mother died when she was nine.  Mary was educated at Tothill’s Creek, Tothill’s Belt and Riverton High School and then went to Adelaide Teachers’ College.  She was gifted at needlework.  She taught at small schools in the vicinity of Pinaroo, Frances, Hawker, Warooka and Kadina until her marriage in 1936 to Maurice Williams of Carrieton at St Agnes Church, Marrabel.  The couple lived at Baldina Downs and later in Burra.  There were three daughters and four sons, but only the eldest lived beyond very early infancy.  Mary was a relief teacher at Burra Primary School in the 1950s and assisted when health and family commitments allowed in Burra Rural Youth and at St Joseph’s Church and School.  Her husband died in 1866 and two of her sister, Essie Evans and Olive Hansbery, also predeceased her.  She became incapacitated in august 1974 and was cared for at Burra Hospital until her death on 31 May 1975.

Burra Community School

The Minister of Education Mr Hugh Hudson has released plans for SA’s first Community Complex School to be built at Burra.  This involves rebuilding the present Burra Primary and High Schools and integrating them into a community facility.  The original school building, which is a structure of historic interest classified by the national Trust, will be preserved.  The interior will be converted into modern open space, leaving areas for primary students.  There will be five additional buildings and a library will be built at the rear of the old building.  The separate building for secondary classes will include science and commercial studies facilities and a third will provide for art and craft activities.  A fourth building will house a drama workshop, activity hall and canteen, while an administrative block will house offices, staff accommodation and a sick room.  The area between the buildings will be developed into an amphitheatre.  The landscaping of the site will provide a new hockey field, an additional oval for primary students and an adventure playground.  The tennis courts in front of the building will remain, while those at the rear will be replaced.  The present impressive façade of the school will be preserved.

Ruth Trevivian nee Glenister1 contributes an article: ‘Memories of Burra’.

She was born in Darton Cottage – formerly Dr Sangster’s [Sen.] residence and her sister was born in ‘Bleak House’, the former Mine Hospital.  She recalls Granny Howell2 living in a cottage a few yards from Darton Cottage, who said she had originally come from England as a lady-in-waiting to someone of high rank.

She remembers getting fitted for shoes at Pederson’s.  Her father was the Choir-master at St Mary’s; he had sung in St Paul’s Cathedral in London before leaving England.  Mr Graham Dow was then organist at St Mary’s and the ministers were Revs Hopton3 and Hewitson4.  A small boy pumped the organ.  She recalls being taken over the Black Bridge to the Chinaman’s Garden5 for vegetables [in Kingston Street] and also being taken for an afternoon walk by a girl from the Reformatory (when Miss Bubb was Matron) and how the girl dumped her on a windowsill of a stock firm for a moment’s rest and the window breaking.  The girl flew along the wide street with her and she can’t recall the outcome.  She remembers the Misses Ethel and Lily James behind the haberdashery counter at Drew & Crewes and Miss Tiver in the dresses and hats department.  Miss Gert Pearce was a reporter and Mr Marston the editor at the Burra Record.  Mr Parks the baker looked like a ghost, standing in his doorway with a big white apron and hair and eyebrows white with flour.  The boys rocking the swing bridge made the journey home uncomfortable and swaggies asleep on the creek banks frightened her when she was on her own.  The creek ran and they caught frogs to release in shop doorways – unbeknown to her mother.  She recalls Mr Wicklein the jeweller, Mr Walker the shot outfitter [sic-?] and Mr Stan Lane the saddler. Mr Streicher’s waxed moustache fascinated her.  She recalls Mr Pearce’s furniture shop with its smell of sawdust and a cat snoozing in the sun and old Mrs Pearce sitting inside the doorway.  She recalls also Pompey Pederson6 and his speedy entrance into Burra after racing from Adelaide.  And the earthquake.  And the tragic death of Mrs Lafsky, who did their washing and was killed at a railway crossing on her way home from one of the stations7.  Other names she mentions include Killicoat, Hann, Dane, Winnall, Jarrett, Pickering, Maundrell, Murphy and Mr Hogg, whose wife was a Belgian.

Burra Bowling Club AGM

The report by retiring President Brian Riggs.

Two members died during the year: Lance Phillips and Hedley Pearce.  Financially the year was a success, due in considerable measure to the bar manager Neil Hurst.  The new watering system is now working well after a few initial hitches.  Membership numbers leave a little to be desired.  Facilities are being constantly improved.  Keith Phillips was the Club Champion and also won the Mid North Champion of Champions at Auburn.  The open tournaments in January and at Easter were a great success despite mediocre weather.

The Associates are an essential part of the club and their catering has been especially capably handled.  The greens were reasonably good throughout and were good for Easter and the inter-divisional championships of the women’s Bowling Clubs.  The purchase of a new mower will make the job of the Greens’ Manager Edgar Pietsch easier.  Andrew Phillips had done good work preparing them for play and Wally Fridd is thanked for attending to the watering.

Obituary.  Arthur L. Bence was born at Hampstead, London in 1892, the eldest of three children.  Both parents died when he was about eight.  His brother and sister went to live in Acton and he lived for the next three years with his maternal grandparents at Chiswick.  When his grandfather died he applied in 1903 to become a Bernado’s Boy and was taken to a home near Whitechapel.  He was trained as a bell-ringer and mandolin player and went on tour with fellow boy musicians to Southern England, Wales and the Channel Islands.  On one tour when he was fourteen he met Olive Stringer and eleven years later they were married in Singapore Cathedral.  
In June 1908 a small party of Barnardo’s Boys led by Rev. W.J. & Mrs Mayers, with Mr Aarons as Musical Director, toured Australia to raise money for the Barnardo’s Homes.  They arrived at Fremantle on 8 August 1908.  They visited each state and New Zealand.  A few weeks before the end of the tour Arthur, with the consent of Rev. Mayers, accepted the offer of a home and job in Melbourne.  A few weeks later his employer lost the agency he had been running and Arthur had to fend for himself.  He worked in Sydney for two years and then answered an advertisement to become a trader in the Solomon Islands in 1912.   At that time he did not see another white face for months.  Eventually a passing schooner picked him up from Guadalcanal when he was seriously ill from malaria, having been deserted by his native helpers, who said he had ‘devil-devil’.  He was returned to Australia, where he recovered.  Over the year he had kept in touch with the Stringer family and on his recommendation they had migrated to Victoria, where they had a grand reunion.  He was still in no position to become engaged to Olive and he returned to the Solomon Islands in 1913 and continued to trade and recruit labour there till 1916.  He then received news that his brother had been severely wounded in the war and he joined the Australian Forces.  He arrived in Egypt early in 1916 and later went on to fight in France.  In 1917 he was badly wounded and convalesced in England before being returned to Australia.  On returning he became engaged to Olive Stringer.  His wound had left him with only one usable arm.  Being used to handling native labour, he decided to become a rubber planter in Malaya and sailed to Singapore in 1918.  He got a plantation manager’s job with control of 250 coolies.  He soon sent for Olive and they were married on Easter Saturday 1918.  About eighteen months later, soon after the birth of their daughter Lotus, the rubber price plummeted from 5/- per pound to 6d per pound.  Mrs Bence and Lotus returned to Australia and three months later Arthur followed.  They settled in Burra where he became an auctioneer.  He also travelled the eastern country selling goods and was soon able to start the business Bence’s Ltd, which still flourishes.  The first sale at the Burra Auction Mart was on 7 September 1921.  The Record reported that this innovation would be a boon to many people, as Mr Bence would be ‘prepared to submit to auction on any Friday, anything brought in from a sucking pig to an elephant’.  They expected it to be an unqualified success.

By 1924 Bence’s – Burra’s Cash Drapery Store was established and they had a second child, Len, the store’s present manager.  During WWII Len was stationed in England where he flew Wellington Bombers, returning safely with an English wife.  Lotus married an Australian flying officer, who was killed by the Japanese in the Solomon Islands after his Catalina crashed.  She remarried and now lives in Norway.

Through good and harsh times the store survived and both Arthur and Olive put much time and effort into its continuing success.  Stories of personal generosity in the supply of clothing etc. to struggling families come from the depression days.  They were both workers for charity.  Despite the disability with his arm, Arthur was an accomplished tennis player and golfer.  Many people will remember the beautiful Pearly King and Queen costumes Mr & Mrs Bence wore to fancy dress functions at times.  Arthur also appeared as Father Christmas and made one novel entry to the RSL Hall when he descended to the floor hand over hand on a rope suspended from a skylight.

[This was a neat trick for a one-armed man!]

They retired in the early 1960s to Glenelg and remained there till Olive’s death a few years ago.  [1971] Mr Stringer, her father, lived to be over 100 and only died in the last couple of years.  Arthur returned to Burra to live in one of the Barker Cottage Homes before going to an Adelaide Nursing Home for a short time and dying there on 3 July.  [2 July according to a previous report.] Father John Morley conducted the funeral in St Mary’s on 5 July.  He is survived by a son, a daughter, four grandsons and one great-grandson.

[Arthur Leonard Bence born 15 October 1892 Hampstead, London: died 2 or 3 July 1975 Adelaide.]

The Ratepayers’ Meeting last week drew a disappointing 34 people.

The Chairman gave his report and said despite State and Federal Government discussion, there had been no change in local government’s reliance on the unpopular land rating system of finance.  A major expense in 1974-75 was the renovation of the Burra Swimming Pool.  Revenue from the Caravan Park was pleasing.  A project on hand was the tidying up of the Burra Creek, which will shortly fill with water.  At Burra North a REDS funded project will see six new tennis courts available for 1975-76.  Six other projects have been put to the REDS authorities.  The Burra Golf Course will be improved by the development of the new clubhouse.  State Government provided a grant of $12,450 towards this.

New Councillors for 1975-76 are:

Baldina Ward	A.A. Barker

Booborowie Ward	J.S .Hawker

Mt Bryan Ward	A.J. Gebhardt

Burra Town Ward	F.R. Ford

Re-elected Councillors are:

In the last fire season Council units attended more fires outside the district than in it.  The Farrell Flat fire truck has been replaced with a cab chassis from Council plant.

Service certificates were presented to Mal. Kellock and Harry Quinn.  Roy Jeffery was unable to be present.

Judge Ward then gave an address.

He agreed with the importance of recognising the service of Councillors, but said many Councils were grossly understaffed and at time job satisfaction was low.  Changing communities also required some changes to Council boundaries.  The main difficulty experienced by all Councils is funding.

One matter given some airing was a call by some ratepayers (supported by a petition) for part of the present Burra Burra Council to secede to Hallett.

Other topics raised centred upon weed control, the rubbish dump and fire bans for the next fire season.

The United Farmers & Graziers’ State Conference in Adelaide is reported at length.

The Anglican Diocese of Willochra is celebrating its Jubilee Year and visits to other parishes in the diocese have been arranged.  Locals went to St Peter’s Winulta, near Maitland, on 29 June.  On Friday at Burra there was a dinner dance and it is anticipated it will have raised c. $800.  Visitors from Maitland attended a 10.30 Eucharist at St Mary’s at which Fr Neihus of Maitland preached.  Dennis Nettleton played the organ.  Lunch was held in the Parish Hall.

Ian Auhl & Denis Marfleet’s book Australia’s Earliest Mining Era is reviewed at length after its launch on 4 August by Warren Bonython at the SA Art Gallery.  Reproduced in it are 31 paintings by S.T. Gill, of which 24 are in colour and 15 concern the Burra Mine and Township.  The original paintings will be on display in the historical section of the SA Art Gallery in Adelaide for the next two months.  There is a specially commissioned review by Hans Mincham, which is more an outline of the contents and the life of S.T. Gill than a critical appraisal of the volume – though what there is in that vein is full of praise.

The Centenary of Parnaroo Hall will be celebrates by a ball there on 16 August, sponsored by the Hall Committee and the Parents & Friends’ Association of Peterborough’s St Joseph’s Convent School.  The hall is a section of the previous Parnaroo Wool Shed, erected in 1875 of stone from the surrounding hills.  It is on a section of Paratoo Station and Pandappa Station, leased by Thomas Elder – 719 square miles with 40,000 sheep.  A portion of the homestead still stands about 400 yards northwest of the Hall.  Local residents bought the Hall from the SA Government in 1904 for £400, since when it has been used for wedding receptions and dances.  It was originally the wool room of the Parnaroo Station Shearing Shed, where 60 stands once operated.  Shearers then started at 6 a.m. with breakfast at 8.30 a.m. by which time 1,000 sheep were shorn.  The pay in 1875 was 20/- or £1 for 100 sheep.  In 1880 the land was subdivided and sold for £1 per acre, but the land proved difficult for farming and finally the Government auctioned off 23 farms in 1893 and the 15,000 acres brought up to 2/4½ per acre.  Descendants of early settlers who remained in the area are the late William Just, August Hennig, William Neil, John O’Toole, Sam Saunders, Albert Gericke, Gustav Gruel, Martin O’Dea and Roland Betty.  Two large families of old were Albert Gericke’s 13 children and John O’Toole’s 12 children.  Early farmers reaped up to 40 bushels per acre and carted it to Ucolta to the train.  In the early 1900s it is said up to 30,000 bags of wheat could be stacked there.  Now there are just two remaining families; Mr & Mrs Roland Betty of Blue Hills Station and Mr & Mrs Flank Polomka of Parnaroo Pastoral Company.  Government grants have enabled the installation of toilets in the hall and an annex on the front.  The Centenary Ball will also feature entertainers from Peterborough and District, and will include the well known country singer Allen Graham of Terowie.

C.M. Lewis & Sons’ shop at Hallett closed on 31 July, ending a life which had begun in 1912, when Fred Lewis, the father of the last owner, Mr Alf Lewis, began the Lewis Bakery.  Mr Lewis Sen. was an Englishman who migrated from Malmsbury in Wiltshire in 1910 and after working in Farrell’s Flat, Broken Hill and elsewhere, arrived in Hallett in 1912.  After his marriage in 1913 he and his English wife spent the rest of their lives in the business.  At first the break etc. was sold from the bakehouse, but in the 1920s the old coaching stables, where the northern coaches changed horses in the early days, were demolished and the present substantial shop and attached house was constructed.  Lewis’s delivered bread to the four shops that were then in Mt Bryan and also two or three times a week to Petherton, Canowie, Willalo and North Booborowie.  In the 1920s there were several grocery stores in Hallett, including Harris’s General Store (later W. Phin’s and now part of the Hall’s family residence).  On the site of the present road-house was a saddler’s shop owned by Alex Davy of Terowie and the grocery shop of John Doyle.  Drew & Crewe’s were in the property now held by Seigert Bros.  Mrs McCrae kept a greengrocer’s shop and refreshment rooms on the property of Mr & Mrs Bill Reed.  There was a butcher shop owned by George Trussler, recently deceased, on the site of the present fire station.  South of the crossroads was Statton’s Blacksmith, Welding & Wheelwright’s business, employing seven men.  It closed in the late 1950s.  Near the railway station was another butcher’s owned by the Carpenter family, adjacent to the first Hallett Hotel, demolished in the early 1970s.  In the 1930s Depression Lewis’s delivered ration bread to the gold miners at Ulooloo.  After the death of Mr Fred Lewis his widow and sons Alf and Arthur took over.  As the Hallett township declined and it became increasingly difficult to get relief bakers, the family ceased baking in the mid 1960s and obtained its bread from Burra.  Alf continued to make pasties and cakes until ill health forced him to close his business.  In recent years he has been assisted by his sister Gladys Mrs Bob Slatter and his brother Arthur and his family.

Dr L.G. Miller writes in reply to Mr Banfield’s recent statements about ‘wicked doctors who are denying patients their “fundamental rights.”’  He opposed the dictatorship from petty bureaucrats that he clearly believed had come with Medibank.

The [Methodist] Ladies’ Guilds of the Middle District converged on Burra on 7 August for a rally that combined the Home and Overseas Missions.  About 200 attended at Burra Methodist Church.  Mrs E. Hore managed proceedings and Rev. G. O’Neil, Middle District Chairman, conducted morning devotions.  Speakers included Mrs Gore (President of WHMA), Rev. Dean Brookes (on Inland Mission work), Rev. Ponciale’o of Samoa and Deaconess E. Simmons on Ba Hospital in Fiji.

He recently received a letter about Fr Pallhuber, who came from Austria in 1856 and journeyed extensively in the north from 1860-1880.  Despite a rather severe look in a photograph, he is described as being kindly, witty, interesting and entertaining and was well regarded by those of other faiths.  He spent a lot of time visiting remote shepherds, prospectors, miners etc. and often had to sleep out in winter in wet clothes.  His horse sometimes headed for home without him – once leaving him to return 15 miles and on another occasion 100 miles.

The rate was declared at 2c in the dollar compared with 1.8c for 1974-75.  This was largely to accommodate inflation.  The minimum rate payable for a property in the Townships of Burra, Mt Bryan, Booborowie and Farrell Flat is $40.  Outside those the minimum rate payable is $15.  The differential rate has been declared at 10c in the dollar for all towns including Hanson, bringing town rates to the maximum possible 12c.  This has followed a further reduction in State grants for road works.  A grant from the Grants Commission in Canberra of $20,000 is one bright spot in the gloom.

Rev. John Morley writes in support of Dr Miller and in opposition to the increasing power of the State.

Mr Allen MP speaking in Parliament, said that in areas controlled by the Commonwealth Railways people wished they were under the SAR for its better service, but in SAR areas people thought the Commonwealth did it better.  He was concerned about railway workers’ housing.  He was afraid Peterborough’s railway workshops would be relocated to Pt Augusta to the detriment of the town and the Premier can offer no assurance that with the transfer of SAR to Commonwealth this will not happen.  The Town Clerk of Peterborough has, however, received an assurance from the Premier that there is a provision ‘that there should be no reduction in the level of employment of railway workshops, without prior agreement with the State Government.

Burra Mine.  Poseidon Directors say that due to low copper prices and falling demand, operations in Burra have had to be curtailed.  They have been reduced from seven to five days a week and twenty employees have been retrenched.  The effect on the town will be widespread.

Burra Burra DC.  The Council is concerned about the Burra Mine retrenchments and will seek Government aid in providing employment.

It is also concerned about the changing ratio of Government grant money to rates as the former falls.  Rates have risen 10% and Council feels any greater rise would bring considerable difficulties to the rural sector.  Roadwork grants have fallen by $11,000.  A more equitable funding formula is needed.

Burra Burra Hospital Inc. AGM

Frank Ford and Allan Baulderstone were welcomed as Members of the Board of Management.

Chairman R.K. Parse read the 98th report of the hospital.

Financially the hospital is very sound.  A credit of $60,000 is invested.  Expenses rose 71% and receipts by 63%.  Bed cost rose by $5 to $22.46.  We were able to show a surplus of $59,298.

Improvements included air conditioning the Nurses Home and a carport there and a new piano.  TV sets were placed in private rooms and handrails in toilets and bathrooms.  The Secretary’s residence was renovated.  The hospital’s interior was renovated and repainted.  Average daily patient numbers rose to a record 27.8 and 24 babies were born.  The auxiliary has maintained linen etc. and restocked the storeroom with jams and preserves.  In the year we lost the services of Sister Goode as tutor, to be replaced by Sister Wall.  After ten years the Secretary-Manager Mr L.H. Packer resigned on 30 June and his place has been taken by Mr Hank Heitbrink.

Meals on Wheels has continued to operate efficiently.

The Council has no present intentions of cutting its workforce.

The Golf clubhouse is almost finished and has now to be paid for – though half comes from grants and much from the club itself.

REDS work has taken funds that will later be repaid.

An appeal for funds from the National Estate has been forwarded to the Government to enable completion of the restoration of the Powder Magazine and work on the Bon Accord Mine Engineer’s Shop, along with further work on the dugouts, Brewery Cellars and Redruth Gaol.

Local Ladies on the Melbourne Cup Fund Raising Committee have offered to help contribute towards a new piano for the Town Hall.

Burra Golf Club

The new clubhouse will be opened on 28 September at 4 p.m.  Four years ago Council acquired the Racecourse and Elder’s Paddock to develop into a recreation area.  Following an offer and request from Council the Golf Club undertook an ambitious plan to redesign the golf course and erect a new clubhouse.  The services of the SA Golf Association’s architect Mr Murray Crafter were employed.  The new course was opened for the 1973 season.  A tree planting program then initiated is continuing; 100 trees are now growing and another 400 are planned.  A grant to partly fund the clubhouse was obtained from the State Government’s Parks and Reserves Committee.  Foundations were laid last May and completion will be in the next two weeks.  The Savings Bank of SA has granted a $9,000 loan to complete the project.

Eastern District Fire Fighting Organisation held its annual meeting at Koomooloo on Wednesday.  Chairman Don Lord welcomed visitors, especially Fred L. Kerr Director of the EFS and his Assistant Tony Kaye and National Parks & Wildlife Officer John Fitzgerald.  He said the fire risk is high this year.  The meeting supported the recommendations of the working party on country fire service re-organisation.  From 1 November 1974 to 25 February 1975 thirteen fires were attended to though only five were in the immediate area.  Radios had proved effective.  Don Lord was re-elected Chairman.  Two Traeger SSB 50 radio transceivers will be bought to give greater coverage.  At present the district covers 30 properties and 25 members.  It was recommended that the organisation becomes incorporated.  Ironically it was raining during the meeting, but the accompanying lightning reminded all that most of last season’s fired had been caused by lightning and in SA such fires had burnt out nearly 31,000 km2.

The Tiver Reunion

A reunion of descendants of James Tiver, who was born 11 June 1929, will be held at Burra 12 October.

James was the son of a baker, Hugh Tiver and his wife Rebecca of Bristol, England.  Hugh died young and James received little education, going to work aged 8 as an apprentice mason.  He married Elizabeth South of Newport and with a young son, James Hugh (then under 2) sailed from Plymouth in the David Malcolm.  A daughter, Margaret Malcolm Tiver, was born on the voyage.  They arrived at Port Adelaide in April 1855 and were met by an uncle, James Rosser.  They came to Burra by bullock dray and James erected a wattle and daub hut near the ford1 where Mr & Mrs Roy Jeffery now live.  Elizabeth died in 1856 and in 1858 James married Emma Price, who had come to SA in 1856 in the Alloquis.  From this marriage there were ten children.  James did contracting work and also did carting to and from Port Adelaide.  He built the middle house in Tiver’s Row in Redruth and it was there that most of the children were born.  Later with Emma’s help he added the houses either side to create Tiver’s Row.  In 1870 he built the house and store at Aberdeen2 and the family then lived there.  Emma and step-son James Hugh Tiver kept the store and James continued with contract work, employing as many as 100 men.  He participated in the construction of the Wallaroo Smelting Works.  James said it was cheaper to cart beer from Port Adelaide than water for the men at Wallaroo.  With Mr Thomas Burgoyne MP and Mr Aaron Cole he built the first macadamised roads in the district, the Aberdeen Ford, the Redruth Bridge3, the original Burra Institute, Burra Railway Station and Yards, the Stationmaster’s residences, from Tarlee to Farrell Flat and many private homes.  When the railway was extended to Hallett in 1876 he opened a branch store there and James Hugh then ran the Hallett Store and became a Councillor and Chairman of the Hallett DC at various times.  James Hugh Tiver died aged 434.

Later James had a large plant at Terowie for building the new railway yard there for the line to continue to Petersburg.  James also bought land; first Mt Cone at Mt Bryan for £1 per acre.  He sold this and bought country at McVitties Flat near Hallett, which he later sold and bought Harry’s, Opie’s and Gare’s farms at ‘Banbury’ Hallett.

In 1888 and later James and his sons purchased and were allotted pastoral leases when the Government cut up the old Paratoo Run and so they founded ‘Pats Well’, later to become ‘Tiverton’.  James was a member of the Kooringa5 Corporation, a Superintendent of the Sunday School and office bearer in the Methodist Church for many years.  He was also a JP and member of both the Masonic and Oddfellows Lodges for many years.  Despite a long hard struggle against drought, James eventually became a prosperous pastoralist.  He died 12 March 1909.  Emma lived until 1926 and died aged almost 90.  She was always a very active support for James and once when he urgently needed supplies at Wallaroo, she packed quickly and made the journey there in a bullock dray with some of the young family.  With no accommodation on arrival they erected an ‘instant cottage’ in one day.  The children of Emma and James were:

Mary Ann (Mrs [Edward Francis] Opie)	Albert Joseph (who died as a child) [aged 3]

Charles Godwin	George Samuel

Emma Price [Mrs John Sara]	Charlotte Dunn [Mrs Arthur Stock]

Edgar	Henry (Harry)

Emily Price6 [Mrs Arthur Sara]	Harold Walter

[Notes:

1In Young Street.

2Tiver’s Railway Store, later known as Sara’s Store on the corner of Young and Morehead Streets.

3This was the 1861 timber bridge.  Tiver & Cole contracted for the masonry abutments.  By 1878 the timbers had rotted and it was replaced by a steel bridge in 1879.  It is possible that the original abutments were retained, but further research would be needed to verify that.

4James Hugh Tiver 3 June 1853-10 April 1896; making him 42 at death.

5This was actually the Burra Corporation or Town Council of Burra.  James Tiver was the Councillor for North Ward December 1883 to November 1887.

6The ‘Price’ is probably an error; it is not added in any of the birth, marriage or death registrations.]

Burra Tourist Promotion Committee Annual Meeting

The meeting failed either to elect a new Chairman or to find a new Secretary.  Messrs Jennison and Scott have retired after fine service.  A further effort to replace them will be made on 18 November.

R. Jennison reported on the year.

The Copper festival in 1974 contributed about $2,500 to the committee’s finances.  We contributed $500 to the Welcome to Burra sign at the southern entrance to Burra and I hope you are gratified with the result.  Areas needing future attention are to increase the caravan accommodation and facilities and the development of the area around the Burra Creek Lake.  The finances of the committee are a healthy $4,988.85.  Other projects considered were the floodlighting of Johnny Green and additional facilities at the War Memorial Oval.

[The report included the usual thanks to those who had contributed.]

Burra Golf Club

The new clubhouse was opened on Sunday when about 300 people attended in fine weather.  A large field of 116 players took part in Foursomes prior to the ceremony.  Mr Baulderstone welcomed visitors and said the services of the SA Gold Association Architect Mr Murray Crafter were obtained for the design of the new course opened at the start of the 1873 season.  Attention then turned to tree planting and the building of the new clubhouse.  The club is indebted to the District Council for the site levelling and road work.  Congratulations were extended to D.T. Jacka & Co.  for producing such a fine building.  Thanks also went to Associate members for their helpfulness throughout the year.  Mr Claude Allen MP said a few congratulatory words and Mr W. Brown as Chairman of the District Council opened the clubhouse.  The State Government had made a grant of $12,300 and the Savings Bank of SA had given a loan of $9,000 repayable by the club and the club had contributed $4,000 and a great deal of time in planning and much voluntary labour.  A lavish afternoon tea followed.

The 1975 show was a success with gate takings of $856, which compared well with 1974’s $1,046, when it coincided with the Copper festival.  President Ron Shipard introduced Hon. Dr Hopgood to open the event.  Much of the success is due to the Secretary Mr Darrell Field.  Entries were good, especially in Horses in Action, Wool, Fruit & Vegetables, Flowers and Birds.  The Sheep Pavilion was full.  Dogs were re-introduced and attracted good entries.  The food and drink stalls have been updated.  The display of modern farming equipment was bigger and better than ever.

Hallett & District Schools Athletics Association

An article outlines the Association’s history at some length.  The inaugural meeting was of teachers only on 14 April 1928.  A later meeting resolved that each school committee appoint two persons to assist the teachers.  The first meeting at the Hallett Oval on 3 October 1928 arranged sports for those from under 7 to under 15 and included novelty events as well as conventional athletics.  A special train came from Terowie and the schools represented were: Whyte-Yarcowie, Terowie, Mt Bryan, Booborowie, Willalo, Ulooloo, Hallett, Booborowie North, Petherton, Narrowie and World’s End.

In the early years a dance was held in the evenings.  This became a concert and dance and continued till 1950.

The exhibition component of the gathering began in 1929.  Meetings continued till 1941 when petrol rationing caused the only postponement of the event.  Over the years team events became increasingly important.  Over time other schools participated including, Mt Bryan East, Ucolta, Sunny Brae, Yongala Vale, Hundred of Whyte and in later years, Burra.  For some years there were special events for Correspondence School children.  The last Executive Meeting of the Association was held on 19 August 1975 when it was resolved to present the balance of money in the account to the St John Ambulance Centre in Burra.  Trophies were distributed to schools and written records were donated to the Burra National Trust.  Of the seventeen school at some time involved, only three were affiliated at the time of the last sports day on 18 April 1975; Hallett, Mt Bryan and Burra.

Burra Community School

Mr Christopher J. McCabe has been appointed Principal of Burra Community School.  He was previously Deputy Principal of Penola High School.  He is the first principal of a Country Community School in SA.  The comprehensive rebuilding of the existing Primary and Secondary Schools provided an integrated educational facility.  The original building, which is of historic interest, and has a National Trust classification, has been preserved.  Mr McCabe will be responsible for the successful introduction of the concept of community education in Burra.  In 1973 Mr McCabe took up a Rotary Foundation award to the USA and studied for his MA at Ball State University, Indiana.  A significant part of his study was community education.  He has taught at Findon and Port Pirie and Mt Gambier High Schools and was appointed Deputy Principal at Penola High School in January 1975.  In the rebuilding process the shell of the original building will be retained, while the interior is converted into modern open space learning areas for the Primary School students.

Football

The Mid North Football League has been dissolved.  Mr A.E. Bannear, Secretary of the League, has advised of the steps in the dissolution of the League.  Notice of the intention of member clubs for the 1976 season was required by 24 December 1975.  It was:

Auburn FC: withdrawal from the League and to remain in recess for 1976.

Aberdeen FC: no response, but remaining in recess for 1976.

Mintaro-Manoora: withdrawal from the League and joining the North Eastern Football League.

Riverton FC: withdrawal from the League and joining the Barossa & Light League.

Robertstown FC: withdrawal from the League and joining the Barossa & Light League.

Saddleworth-Marrabel United FC will amalgamate with the Riverton FC with the new team to enter the Barossa & Light League.

As a consequence the AGM of the Mid North Football League will be held on 2 February 1976 at Saddleworth, when it will discuss and act on clause 6 of the constitution, to dissolve the League.  In the next two months all players will be transferred either to the Barossa & Light League or to the North Eastern Football League and in the case of the Riverton and United players, transferred to the new club and then to the Barossa & Light League.  A wind-up dinner will be held at a date to be fixed.  A history of the League from its foundation, possibly in 1911, to its dissolution is in hand.  Clubs are asked to give consideration to setting aside certain funds for this purpose.

Football

The Mid North Football League held its AGM 2 February.  President Mr S. Noske read the report for 1975.  There was a credit balance of $1,354.14.  G. Hirschausen & P. Reed moved that the Aberdeen FC be allowed to withdraw from the League and the Club to remain in recess.  It was then unanimously resolved to dissolve the League.  It was resolved to have a Mid North Football League Dinner. And to have the History of the Mid North Football League recorded by the League secretary and published.  $150 was retained to cover the basic publishing costs with one copy to go to each club and a further decision to be made on other copies.

Funds are to be divided $170 each to Riverton, United, Mintaro-Manoora and Robertstown, with $130 each to go to Aberdeen and Auburn.  Money from the disposal of assets is to be divided equally between the six clubs.  Shield are to be returned to the Secretary at the end of the 1976 season and then to be given to the club with most names thereon.  Other final arrangements were made and the records will go to SA Archives.

Burra National Trust held its AGM on 9 February.

Retiring President G.E. O’Connor reported.

The Federal Government’s National Estate program provided $12,000 in a grant, but it had to be spent in two months, which meant it could not be used to best advantage.  Work done was:

The Bon Accord Engine Shop was half re-roofed and the building repainted satisfactorily after Mr Cockington had condemned the contractor’s first efforts.  Drainage was improved on the southern side.

Restoration of the second dugout was commenced as a voluntary project, but when $2,500 became available it was contracted to G. Nourse and D. Cockington.  Some work remains to be done.

$3,800 was allocated for the restoration of the old Powder Magazine.  The first contractor withdrew over a dispute concerning the quality of work and it was completed by Don Villis.  The western wall (previously dismantled) was rebuilt and the eastern wall of the magazine itself was removed.  The building is secure, but much more needs to be done.  After we had spent the money it was discovered that the Powder Magazine was not National Trust Property, which upset National Estate authorities because the funds were only to be spent on Trust owned properties.  It was finally resolved by the Council giving the Trust control of the property by means of a covenant.

We have found that local contractors give greater satisfaction than outsiders.

Ian Auhl published two beautiful books during the year.

Late in the year the Diamond T fire engine that served the town from 1937-75 was offered for sale by the Fire Brigade Board and was snapped up by the District Council who sold it to the National Trust.

Our first ever organised dinner in December 1974 at the Kooringa Hotel was well attended and very satisfactory.

[The retiring President G.R. O’Connor also acknowledged the support of all volunteers, Mr Woollacott, the District Council and the Federal Government for their respective support.]

Burra Methodist Circuit cancelled the family camp at Melrose due for 12-14 March.

‘Glen View’ Mr Bryan was auctioned at the RSL Hall in Burra on 19 October.  The 2,733.8 ha property was offered in nine lots of which five were sold at auction:

‘Back Paddock’ of 97.2 ha for $15,000 to Dudley Cockington Nominees Pty Ltd of Burra.

‘Weber’s Front Paddock’ of 54.27 ha for $7,900 to H.D. & C.L. Jones of Hallett.

‘Weber’s Homestead’ of 167.67 ha for $11,000 to Alden Stud, Box 37, Hallett.

BCS will launch the first Community School Week 15-19 March.  For that week the normal program will be suspended.  Special student courses related to the curriculum will be held from 9-11 a.m. and for the rest of the day mini-courses on a wide variety of subjects will be held for both students and adults.  Courses are free except for any materials used.  Courses are being supported by Sturt CAE and the Clare Further Education Centre as well as by the school staff and community volunteers.  For the students work experience has also been arranged.  Added to the student program are the Year 8 camp at Barmera and a Year 12 visit to Adelaide tertiary education centres and some Festival of Arts productions.  Unfortunately this week clashes with Field Day Week and in future this will be avoided.

New Electoral Boundaries

Mr Claude Allen MP has decided not to contest the seat of Frome at the next election.  Following the redistribution based on the one vote one value principle the electorate will become much larger and he says it could not be represented by one person and have the sort of representation the electors are entitled to.  The redistribution has been passed with Liberal Movement support.  Mr Allen was elected first as successor to the late P.H. Quirke in 1968.  In 1970 the Electorate of Burra was abolished.  The western half went to the electorate of Rocky River and the eastern half went into Frome.  Mr Allen won Frome and has contested and won four elections in just over seven years.  The present Electorate of Frome covers 38% of the state and could become larger with the redistribution.  Mr Allen will retire to Spalding on the completion of his parliamentary term.  Before becoming a politician he was a farmer for forty years.

Burra Primary School Welfare Club

President Mrs J.S. Tiver presented the 1975 and final report to end 38 years of service under the present title.

This year there were 42 members and an average attendance of 22.  The short period of tenure of Mr Howard Groome was productive and he was a sincere and capable leader.  Sports Day in April allowed the Club to raise $268.  A Tabloid Sports Day was held in November and was generally acclaimed as a preferable format.  Other fund raising for the year brought in $319.  $826 has been provided for the purchase of equipment and the present bank balance is $245.  [The various guest speakers are reported.]

Burra H.S. Parents & Friends’ Association.  Report by Shirley Thamm.

The seven meetings had an average attendance of 14.  Principal Miss Pat Payne proved to be friendly and maintained good communications with the parent body.  Profits from the School Sports Day were $240 and the High School Ball made a profit of $252.  Other income of $489 allowed a donation of $600 to be made for matriculation books.  $200 was donated for outdoor seating, $50 for indoor games and $50 for the mower fund.  The bank balance is presently $283 with a further $800 in deposit stock.

Water was poured on the carpet; glass in historic photographs was broken.  Sunburn cream was applied to a glass case and a door.  Books and magazines were thrown around and some were torn.  The Reserve Sacrament was removed from the Aumbry.  The adjacent hall was also entered and coffee and tea were mixed with the children’s sand tray.

St Joseph’s was visited by vandals about a week ago.  The vandals have since been apprehended.  The church will now be locked when not in use.

Adam Thomas Simpson is the adopted infant son of Brian & Judy Simpson of Melbourne and a grandchild for Nancy & Len Simpson of Burra.

National Trust

A Junior Branch of the National Trust has been formed within the Community School.  The inaugural meeting was on 15 April.  President, Brenton Henriks; Vice-President, Anthony Lloyd; Secretary, Daryl McGuire; Treasurer, Anthony Quinn and works foreman, Mark Hopkins.

The group’s present major objective is the completion of the restoration work at the Bon Accord building.  The Senior Branch is removing the Queen Victoria letter receiver from its position in Commercial Street to allocation opposite the Barker Homes near the Hospital, where it will once more be on active service.

The town’s original fire engine will be kept in running order and will be seen at special events.

[In the paper of 4 May, page 7, this was corrected to say that the comparatively recently retired 1930s Diamond T fire brigade will be kept in running order.]

The restoration of the Powder Magazine is nearing completion.

The new waterproof surface replaces the original roof platting.  The stonework will soon be re-pointed and an iron gate placed at the entrance.

Borers have attacked the roofing timbers at the restored dugouts.

BCS will conduct a recreation program for young people during the May school vacation.  Mr Richard Bednall, the Physical Education teacher, will organise the program.  Community involvement now includes card evenings and a yoga group.

Mr Bob Steel, President of Burra RSL, addressed an assembly of students from Year 4 to Year 12 on the significance of Anzac Day at an assembly on Friday.

A History of the Burra Record by Ian Auhl

The paper began on 30 June 1876 as the Northern Mail

Six months later it changed its name to the Burra News and Northern Mail.

In July 1878 its new editor, Frederick William Holder announced its new title would be the Record.

On 4 October 1878 the name changed again to the Burra Record.

It had taken a long time for Burra to get a local paper.  Compare its starting date with the Kapunda Herald (1864), the Kadina & Wallaroo Times (1865) and the Northern Argus (Clare, 1869).

Burra had to make do with printed handbills for advertising and a town crier.  Other local news was occasionally to be found in the Adelaide papers the Advertiser or the Register or the weekly Observer.

The first editor, Henry Pether, ascribed this lack to opposition to a paper from the SA Mining Association, which had also been against local government.

The first editor of the Burra Record was Frederick William Holder.  He had come to the town in 1875 as a bachelor to take charge of the Burra Public School.  He became an active member of the Burra Parliamentary Club and discussion in this club led to the proposal for a local paper.  A committee was formed to establish one.  The cost originally of 3d made it too expensive for many and kept its circulation low; 600 by the end of 1876.  Pether left in June 1878, soon after Jarman’s departure.  The Government school opened in January 1878, leaving Holder without a job.  When the editorship became available the committee of eight co-proprietors appointed Holder in his place.

In October 1878 Holder became the sole proprietor.

Under Holder the paper flourished.  He became Mayor of Burra in 1886 and again in 1888, having been elected to Parliament in 1887.  He was later Premier of SA on two occasions.

The paper has had three homes.  The first seems to have been on what is now the eastern corner of Bence’s store.

In September 1880 Holder announced they would move next door because the original office was about to be demolished to make room for two new shops to be built for Messrs Drew & Co.

Three years later on 6 January 1883 four shops on Market Square were destroyed by fire: Lane’s Saddlery, Geake’s store, Packard’s Solicitor’s Office, Doe’s Hairdressing Salon and the Burra Record Office.

Despite the complete destruction the Burra Record appeared later that week, having been printed in Adelaide.  The shops were rapidly rebuilt.

Late in 1883 the paper was issued twice a week and the price fell to 2d.

In 1890 Holder sold the paper to Mr P. Murrie Jnr.

In January 1891 the paper reverted to being a weekly.

In September 1891 W.J. Davey took over as editor.  [And later became the proprietor.]

Davey reduced the size of the paper and in 1904 increased the pages to 8.

Davey sold out to Ernest Frederick Marston in March 1913.

In 1945 E.F. Marston sold the paper to his son Frank Teare Marston.

In 1942 the paper was reduced to four pages, but increased again to 8 from 1945.

E.E. & R.E. Angel acquired the paper in June 1954.  The Marstons had printed the paper for 41 years.

Eric Angel must be the person with the longest association with the paper.  He came to Burra from Eudunda in 1929 and was employed by Mr Marston Sen. and then by his son before taking it over in 1954 with his son, Bob, the present editor.

[Auhl fails to mention the move from Market Square to Commercial Street and its date.  I have not ascertained when it moved to Commercial Street, but the Market Square premises were destroyed by fire again in April 1910, but were rebuilt on the same site.  In January 1935 they were in Commercial Street when a fire that began in an adjoining shop again burnt out the office, but this time the press was saved.  See also 98, 21, 29 June 1976, page 7 for corrections to this history.]

Dennis as a boy – both his father and an uncle had been WWI veterans and C.J. Dennis devotees.  His winning poem is titled Chapel Street Burra SA.

E.F. Marston who took over the paper in 1913 did not run a photographic studio.  His predecessor Mr W.J. Davey did.

Mr Simon Newell of Newell’s Travel Agency in Falmouth, Cornwall, contacted Mr Ian Auhl recently on behalf of a client, Mr John Gill aged 72.  Mr Gill had read the Burra Sketchbook and it prompted the contact.

Mr Gill came to Australia in 1921 as a sponsored emigrant and returned to the UK in 1928.  While in Australia he drove a 1904 Sunbeam Talbot for Mr Jim Gallagher of Quondong Station and later a f-ton International truck and trailer for the Burra firm of Drew & Crewes.  On the delivery run for the firm Mr Gill took three days for the round trip and was paid £4 for a seven day week.  There were 90 gates to open and close on the route, still served by a Burra contractor.  Mr Gill claims that he and a companion brought in the first load of wool from the ‘outback’ by mechanised transport.  Soon after arriving back in the UK he set out on a round the world tour on a motor bike with sidecar. (A Vincent HRD)  This took over a year.  He married and has two daughters.  For many years he was chief engineer for the Admiralty and moved to Falmouth about 33 years ago.

BCS will hold its first Annual Ball on Friday 20 August in the Burra Town Hall.  The ball will be attended by Mr Claude Allen MP, who will launch the ‘Buy a Brick’ campaign.  This is to raise funds for the School Community Hall.  Years VI & VII students are planning an end-of-year social.

Lutheran Sunday School Rooms at Burra North will be dedicated on Sunday 15 August with a special service at which Pastor Kuchel and previous Pastors A.H. Schmidt and P.A. Scherer will officiate.  Luncheon will follow in the Redruth Memorial Hall.  The first Lutheran Church was built opposite the Court House at Burra North.  This later was burnt down and the deeds were lost.  Services were then held in a variety of places, served by the Pastor from Kunden Parish, Waterloo.  Among places used were the Copperhouse Methodist Church [actually Westbury Methodist Church, adjacent to Copperhouse] the Oddfellows’ Hall Burra North and the Church of England Hall at Burra.  There is little evidence of Sunday school activity during this period.

In 1967 parishes were re-aligned and Burra joined with the Clare-Blyth parish.  Colin Heinrich is then noted as the first Sunday school teacher.  On 21 August 1967 the existing Burra Lutheran Church arrived on a low loader from Mansfield Park.  The building was placed on newly acquired land at Burra North and dedicated on 5 November 1967.  In 1968 David Munzberg was elected Sunday school superintendent and Mr Kleinig as a teacher.  At times lessons were held in the back seat of a car until the late Mr P. Beinke kindly lent his house.  This became unsatisfactory when numbers increased to make three classes.  Classes were then held in the vestry, porch and hall of the church.  Eventually it was possible to obtain a four-roomed building at Milang for $650.  It arrived in Burra in January 1976 and was sited north of the church.  The building required considerable repairs and repainting.  This work has now been completed.  There are presently 27 children on the roll with three helpers, three relief teachers, four teachers and a Sunday school superintendent.

The Burra Show [Incorrectly cited as the 99th.]

The day dawned frosty and remained fine, but became intensely cold as the day progressed.  A fair crowd attended.  The gate amounted to $615.  There were record entries for horse in action.  Michelle Burton was Miss Show Girl and A. Talent won the open shearing contest.  Show President Mr Ron Shipard welcomed guests and thanked exhibitors and all those who worked so hard to put the show on.

Mr Ray McCallum, President of the Northern Show Societies, from Orroroo opened the show.

Junior Miss Show Girl was Mary-Anne Shipard.

Sub-Junior Miss Show Girl was Carolyn Armstrong of Burra.

In the open shearing contest L. Hughes and A. Talent both scored 187 points and there was a shear-off to decide the winner, with Arthur Talent coming out on top.  The judges were Tony Ryan and Graham Heine.

Greg Germein won the Novice Section.

Art entries were of a very high standard.

Budgerigars were of a good standard with some excellent young birds.

Pigeons were a big improvement on last year’s display.

Poultry were well staged, but the number of shows held on the same day made it hard to get a large show of top birds.

Children’s pets were well displayed and covered a wide range from a goat to a white mouse.

Cattle had some good heifers, but generally carried less condition than in 1975.

Cooking was of a good standard with notably good cheesecake, boiled fruit cake and chocolate cake entries.

Junior entries were impressive.

Flowers were down a bit due to the season, but there was a fair display and some very good blooms.

Floral Art was good, with outstanding entries under ‘Á Song Title’.  The children’s section was a pleasure to judge.

Grain entries were down, but of good quality.

Fodder entries reflected a dry season.

Goat entries showed good potential in the young stock.

Needlework entries were down, but work on the whole was good, especially in the Crochet Cloth.

Produce entries were few.  The winning sauce entry was excellent.

Vegetable entries were down due to the severely cold winter.  Quality was, however, a little better.

Poll sheep were of excellent quality and the Champion Ram was excellent.

The Champion Ewe was an excellent breeder with a thick covering of strong wool.

In the medium wool section the entries were of a high standard and numbers were high.

The Champion Strong Wool Ram carried a good bulky 58’s fleece.

The ewe section was particularly strong in both numbers and quality.

Wool:

The fleeces shown were particularly well grown and many fleeces weighed in excess of 10 kg.

Leighton Basketball Club has been disbanded.  It had been formed on 4 May 1946 and with the Spalding, Hallett and Booborowie Clubs formed the North-Eastern Basketball Association.  They played on a ground at the Leighton Recreation Ground, which had been already graded for a tennis court.  The Leighton team was premier in its first year.  Nelda Bruce (Kleinig) was Club President 1946-55.  Elvyn Collins took over for 1956-58 and 1966-68.

In 1956 permission was given to play on asphalt courts at the Recreation Ground.  Jacie Bruce was President 1959-61 when Mr F. Goodridge became President.  Due to lack of players the club went into recess until 1963, when it entered a team in ‘C’ Grade in the North-Eastern Association.  In 1965 & 1966 ‘B’ and ‘C’ Grade teams were entered.  In 1967 ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ Grade teams played.  In 1968 ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ Grade teams were fielded and three teams continued to play until 1973.

Amalgamation with Booborowie and Hallett was discussed in 1972, but it was decided to continue.

Circumstances prevented it entering teams in the North-Eastern Association in 1974 and it then joined the Stanley Netball Association and in 1974 entered two teams.  The senior of these was premier in ‘C’ Grade in 1975.  The Stanley and Mid-North Associations amalgamated in 1976 and distances became too great.  The players joined the United Club.

The retiring President Allen Baulderstone reported on a successful season.  Renewed interest saw an increase in membership for both men and associates.  Most Saturdays saw over 40 players hitting off.  Stan Longford won the Club Championship and Kies van der Does won the ‘B’ Grade, with Don Lloyd winning in the ‘C’ Grade and Roger Buckley in the ‘D’ Grade.  The open day was successfully held on 15 August when Dean Harris won the Open Championship and equalled the course record.  Financially the club has almost overcome the trials of building the clubhouse and is almost back to the credit balance of 1975.  Two payments have been made off the clubhouse loan and $1,000 spent on a tractor and equipment.  The annual cabaret on 17 September was a financial success and should nett in excess of $300.  A cheque from the Burra Sports Syndicate has not yet been used and is in a fixed deposit.  The associates have again been a great support and the catering for open day was notable.  The tree planting program under Ern Zanker has continued.

Burra Mine

The Chairman of the Burra Burra DC sent telegrams yesterday to the Premier Mr Dunstan, the Leader of the Opposition Dr Tonkin and the Minister of Mines Mr Hudson.  They expressed the hope that some action could be taken to save 62 jobs directly involved at the Burra Mine following the concern of people in the town and district towards Samin Ltd being in receivership.  He believed the mine was viable even at the present depressed copper prices and that future operations were straight forward and efficient.

Burra Mine

The Burra community became worried when the Poseidon receiver and manager Mr Buckley and Professor Rudd visited the town and inspected the Mine.  The business people and the town generally grew concerned and telegrams were sent to the Premier, the Minister of Mines and the Leader of the Opposition.  Professor Rudd says the Mine is presently operating with a small profit and it is not intended to close it.  But we all know that if the price of copper drops much more it could cause the Mine’s closure.  At present the Mine employs 62 people and when in full production, 100.  Samin owns several houses in the town.  In Parliament the Hon. Hugh Hudson said that discussions with Samin had been going on for some time and would be continued with the receiver.  Poseidon, Samin’s parent company is in difficulty and if Samin needed cash to sustain a period of insufficiency there would be a problem.  The difficulty is greater for Burra because it produces a specialty product for which appropriate markets had to be developed.  The Government certainly wishes to keep the Burra Mine going if it can reasonably be achieved, but it cannot support an operation if it is likely to continue to be unprofitable.  There are hopes the copper price will recover by the end of June and hopefully the Government will be able to reach an agreement with the receiver to ensure the Mine can continue so that the market can be tested.  We cannot, however, say with any certainty that this will be achieved.

Bankcard began to operate in Burra yesterday.

Burra Town Hall upgrading continues.  Some new seats will be bought.  The stage curtains will be altered to provide wings at the sides.  New welded steel handrails have been placed at the side of the external steps at the entrance and these have been painted white.

Work on the beautification of Burra Creek is proceeding, with the new car park opposite the Town Hall being levelled and a low stone barrier wall will now be erected.  Seats, tables and barbecues will be placed on the opposite sides of the creek and extensive tree planting will be undertaken.  The Tourist Promotion Committee is co-operating with the Apex Club and the Community School in this.  The National Trust is planning to embark on tree planting as well.

About 20 properties on which rates have not been paid for at least three years will soon be sold by the Council.

BCS.  The Management Committee has been looking at the possibility of the BCS Library becoming a Community-School Library.  The present library is set up to serve the needs of the school students.  If it became a Community-School Library it would be funded in three ways; through the Education Department, through the State Government vis the State Library and through the local District Council.  As well as books there would be periodicals and cassettes available.  Access would be given to all State Library resources.  It would normally have 14 books per head of population and the annual replacement would be about one seventh of the stock.  Institute libraries in the district would have to be dissolved and in return the Community-School Library would set up branches, which would provide books and periodicals and change the stock regularly by means of the school bus service.  Books of historical or local significance would be retained by the local branch.  The whole arrangement was discussed by representatives of those involved at a meeting on 11 November.

Each Council and Institute must now make its own decision. So far the Burra District Council has come out enthusiastically in favour and the Booborowie Institute has also agreed.  Other decisions are eagerly awaited.

Mr Perth Collins passes on a little information compiled by the late Miss Alice Collins, concerning the late Henry Collins of ‘Lucerndale’ Mt Bryan.

Henry Collins came to SA with his parents in 1839 from Devonshire.  He was then aged 6.  His first job was to mind a mob of sheep.  When the family came to Burra they had to construct dug outs in the bank of the Burra Creek.  At an early age he went to work in the Burra Mine and when his father went to the Victorian gold rush he was the sole support of his mother.  Later they were able to buy a couple of bullock teams and began carting between Burra and Port Adelaide.  Henry was so small that he had to use a stool to enable him to place the yokes on the bullocks.

The Burra Methodist Women’s Fellowship voted at its recent annual meeting to go into recess.

The Melbourne Cup Luncheon was the best attended ever, with 250 ladies present.  The profit was about $1,000, which will be divided between Red Cross, RFDS and the Town Hall Piano Fund.  John Ovenden was the guest speaker.

The Season.  Although the season has improved in the last few weeks the state’s wheat crop is likely to be less than half the ten year average, but barley will be almost 80% of the ten-year average.  Up to 50% of sheep and cattle have been moved from the lower rainfall areas to the cereal belt, either for agistment or slaughter.

Ratepayers’ Meeting

About 30 people attended the meeting called by the Burra Burra DC Chairman Cr R.B. Jennison last Wednesday night.  The Council had felt the impact of a slowing inflation rate.  While Government grants for road works are decreasing, the no-strings Federal Grants increased to $45,000 from $20,000 in 1975-76.  Council has budgeted for a planned program of district road works.  Nominated streets in Burra will be reformed and sealed.  Council assisted with the site works at the new Burra Community School and the go-ahead for this $3 million project will stabilise Burra as an important district centre.  The improvements to the Burra Creek in the town in conjunction with the Tourist Promotion Committee, Apex and BCS and the National Trust is another significant project.  We hope drainage problems in the business area will be addressed with funding for the Effluent Drainage Scheme in 1977-78.  Plans are under way to give the district a superior library service.  Council will join in the Pest Plants Control and Vertebrate Pests Act projects.

[The report then lists a number of subjects about which questions were asked, but does not report any answer given.]

Characteristics of the paper in 1976

It was a rather disappointing paper for local coverage.  Some events that are foreshadowed are not reported when they occurred.  There are many general interest items, which, while relevant to local farming or grazing, were not local news.

The District Council reports are mostly useless and frequently indicate that a question was raised, but not what it was or what resulted.  An example would be:

‘Mines Royalty – Dept. of Mines re royalties Burra Mines.’

As in 1975 AGM material is printed, but there is no evidence that the paper itself was doing much in the way of collecting material.

Bence’s Ltd Drapery & Clothing Store has changed hands after operating for 56 years.  Proprietor-Manager Mr Len Bence has conducted the business since the early 1960s following the retirement of the late Arthur and Olive Bence.  Arthur started life in Burra as an auctioneer, holding sales of furniture and sundry items.  This followed a period of trading in the Solomon Islands around 1913.  He saw active service in Egypt and France in 1916.  He also travelled around the eastern country selling goods and was soon able to start Bence’s Ltd, which has flourished ever since.*  The first sale at the Burra Auction Mart was advertised on 7 September 1927.*  The editor commented that it should be a boon to many people.  By 1924 the columns of the Record were advertising Bence’s Cash Drapery Store.  The store has kept its doors open through hard times and times of plenty.

Now Mr Len Bence intends to devote more of his time to a life-long interest in painting.  Many of his fine works already adorn the walls of homes in the area.  Len and Muriel intend to stay on in Burra.  The new proprietor is Mr Arnold Earnshaw who intends to carry on business with the same staff and will trade under the name of Bence’s.  He previously had a similar business at Leigh Creek and has been associated with the trade for many years, including the management of several of C.J. Coles’ Variety Stores.

[*Some of these dates and statements are not quite true.  The following references from the Burra Record may clarify the history of the enterprise:

XXXXIII, 35, 31 Aug. 1921, page 2: Advt.  A.L. Bence (late AIF) Auctioneer & Commission Agent sets up the Burra Auction Mart opposite Eyes & Crowle’s in Commercial St.  Furniture, Poultry and all classes of goods every Friday from 9 September.

XXXXIV, 38, 20 Sep. 1922, page 3: Advt.  ‘Bon March’  Burra’s new shop will be opened by A.L. Bence in that portion of the Auction Mart previously occupied by Mr Woollacott on 21 September.

XXXXV, 4, 24 Jan. 1923, page 3: A.L. Bence will be moving into the premises formerly occupied by Miss Snell and will open the shop as a general cash drapery store with occasional auction sales.

XXXXVI, 1, 9 January 1924, page 2: Advertisement for Bence’s Burra Cash Drapery Stores & Agent for Alston’s Windmills

52, 5, 4 Feb. 1931, page 2: Advt.  This issue carried the last advertisement for Bence’s.  It announced the last week of their Summer Sale.  [For the continuation of the business as Bence’s Ltd see 52, 11, 18 Mar. 1931 page 2.]

52, 11, 18 Mar. 1931, page 2: Advt.  The formation of Bence’s Ltd is announced.  It was financed by certain local people and managed by A.L. Bence.  Bence’s Ltd has purchased the entire assets in the assigned estate of A.L. Bence at a huge discount.  [There location is not stated, but probably the west side of Market Square.  In any case by August the former SAFU store that had been the location of Bence’s Cash & Carry Department was vacant and available for a dance.]

52, 33, 19 Aug. 1931, page 3: Shell Co. Dance.  The Shell Co. is to hold a dance in every town in Australia on 29 August and Mr T.H. Woollacott has been tireless in making arrangements.  The Institute Hall is engaged and so the SAFU store, now vacant, (but late [Bence’s] Cash & Carry Store) will be used.]

Premier Don Dunstan visited Burra last Tuesday.  In a busy day he met the Burra Burra DC, the School Council, inspected Samin Ltd Mine, toured the town’s hotels and attended an evening barbecue.

At the school he said the SA Government was proud of the pioneering work being done at the Burra Community School.  The co-operation and sense of community of the people of Burra ensure that in every sense it will be a Community School.  He inspected the work on the new site.

He also had a meeting with the District Council where he was welcomed by Mr Jennison, who stressed the need for a sealed east-west road from Morgan to Spalding.

A meeting of parents was attended by more than 100 people.  The election of the new School Council was held.

New members: Mr R. Shipard, Mr R. Thamm, Mr R. Stockman, Mr B. Stockman and Mr G. Kellock.

Continuing members: Mrs O. Holmes, Mrs J. Tiver, Mr D. Nettleton, Mr G. Searle.

Mr D. Lloyd represents the District Council and Mr R. Mason is the Parliamentary representative.

For the Parents & Friends’ Association elected were: President, Mrs C. Stockman; Vice-President, Mrs M. Lloyd; Secretary, Mrs H. Reed and Treasurer, Mrs G. O’Connor.

The Parents & Friends’ Assoc. in 1976 had nine meetings with an average attendance of 48.  Mr R. Thamm reported that the Centenary Booklet is in the hands of Mr I. Auhl and is progressing well.  The application for a dental clinic was refused as there are insufficient students for a full-time clinic, but discussion with Mr Don Dunstan indicated the possibility of a mobile clinic.  Mr I. Allen has resigned as Chairman of the Primary School Council, a member of the Community School Council and as Chairman of the Community School Management Committee after years of dedicated work.  A minute of appreciation was recorded.

A Council Levy of $500 per family, which in comparison to many schools was very modest, was added to the booklist this year.  It will be used for administration costs, insurance fees, maintenance of Council property and for school amenities.  [This must surely be a misprint?]

Mrs E. Carpenter, Community School Co-ordinator reported on programs and services offered.

In 1975 there were four DFE Classes and in 1976 there were 9.  There were 7 voluntary classes in three centres; Burra, Hallett and Booborowie and 4 voluntary evening classes.

In October Community School Week saw 292 adult enrolments.

There was a Vacation Recreation Centre run each holiday.

Youth Club attendance varied from 40 to 80.

The Burra Community Entertainment Group put on Salad Days.

Support was given to Arts Council Productions and to the Art Gallery Travelling Exhibition.

A Junior National Trust Branch had been established.

Horse riding was organised in vacations.

A Dog Obedience Club was run.

There were ballet classes and a DFE class in Leather Embossing.

A Toy Library had been set up.

The Management Committee has taken on the establishment of the Community School Library as a major operation and has instituted a comprehensive list of all organisations and clubs within the district.

Burra Traders’ Association has decided to be more active in trying to bring trade back to Burra.

E.C. Allen MP, Member for Frome writes:

When Mr Jennison greeted the Premier recently he suggested that the Burra District had little or nothing to show by way of benefits from many years of Liberal Party Government.  I cannot speak for the period of the Playford era, but this assertion is not true for the time of the Hall LCL Government 1968-70.  The efforts of the Minister of Mines Hon. R.C. De Garis MLC in that Government had much to do with the re-opening of the Burra Mine by Samin Ltd.  A program of sealing portions of main roads each year was commenced and the sealing of the Hanson-Clare Road was commenced – it has still not been completed after seven years of a Labor Government.  The Hall Government also investigated a site for a new Burra High School and had plans drawn up.  There was then a desire to move to another site and the Hall Government was defeated at that point, but it had much to do with the progress towards a new school for Burra.  Construction work which was begun on the Morgan-Spalding Road by the Hall Government has been discontinued under Labor.

[Check to see if the ‘he’ in the first sentence applies to Jennison or Dunstan.]

Hallett Institute.  President Mr B.H. Richards spoke at the AGM on 17 February of problems associated with a lack of interest and support and of financial woes.  The closure of the National and ANZ Bank branches has reduced income for the Institute and the M&BHA has also closed its fortnightly clinic.  Only essential maintenance could be carried out.  The committee recommended joining the Burra Community Library, but a public meeting pressed for the retention of the Institute Library.

Burra Library AGM elected President, Mr R.J. Steele, Vice-Presidents, Mrs Ben Kotz and Mrs I. Hirschausen; Secretary, Mr Ben Kotz & Treasurer, Mrs E. Carpenter.  Support this year was appreciated from the Burra Burra DC and from a raffle.  A special meeting in December resolved to join the Burra Community Library, but the present arrangements will continue until the new library is established.

The final issue as the Burra Record.

The Burra Record will amalgamate with the Peterborough and Orroroo based paper, the Review Times, which in future will be the Review Times Record and which will be printed in Port Pirie by the latest offset process by Independent Newspapers Ltd.  This will be the final issue as the Burra Record.

The price of the enlarged paper will rise from 8c to 10c a copy.  R.E. & A.J. Angel will continue with their job printing and act as agents for the new paper, accepting advertsing, copy and photographs for it.  Representatives of the publishers will make periodical visits to Burra to assist advertisers with copy and layouts, in which photos and drawings will be more readily incorporated.  Advertisers should benefit from the larger circulation and more modern printing facilities.  The cost of production at Burra has been rising and it is increasingly hard to get replacement parts for the old machines.  Another reason for amalgamation is the retirement of the linotype operator Eric angel, who came to the office in 1929 and has been setting the type here for 45 years.  The office is not closing as a job printing service.

Booborowie will celebrate the centenary of its proclamation as a township on 29 March 1977.  A committee has been formed to make arrangements for celebrations on 30 April and 1 May 1977.  There will be a Back to School and a tea at the Hall followed by an Old Style Dance.  Sunday will begin with a combined church service in the Hall and the unveiling of a commemorative plaque and there will be a barbecue lunch.

Frank Slatter of Spalding says today is the 25th anniversary of his arrival in SA.  He and a mate, Bert Poole, came to Adelaide on the Omar having been sent from Balliol College Boys Club in Oxford to learn Farming.  They commenced at the Booborowie Experimental Farm.  Frank put in six years there, ending up as head stockman.  Bert Poole returned to England in the depression, but Frank thinks there are a number of the lads who worked on the Booborowie Farm still in Australia.  He would be glad to hear from any.

The Cabaret at the Gaol on Saturday had a somewhat disappointing turnout.  The place was well prepared with the Stimulus Band and a portable dance floor and the supper was superb.  Profits have yet to be finalised.
